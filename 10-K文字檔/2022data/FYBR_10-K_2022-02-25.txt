Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Overview
Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. is a provider of communications services in the United States, with approximately 2.8 million broadband customers and 15,600 employees, operating in 25 states as of December 31, 2021. We offer a broad portfolio of communications services for consumer and business customers. These services include data and Internet services, video services, voice services, access services, and advanced hardware and network solutions.
On April 30, 2021, we emerged from bankruptcy with a restructured balance sheet, a new management team, and a new purpose to Build Gigabit America by expanding and transforming our fiber network in order to meet the rapidly increasing demand for data from both our consumer and business customers. We believe that a fiber network has competitive advantages to be able to meet this growing demand, including faster download speeds, faster upload speeds, and lower latency levels than alternative broadband services.
In August 2021, we announced our plan to accelerate our fiber build to reach 4 million fiber passings by December 31, 2021, and 10 million total fiber passings by December 31, 2025. We are prioritizing our activities to locations which we believe will provide the highest investment returns. Over time, we expect our business mix will shift significantly, with a larger percentage of revenue coming from fiber as we implement our expansion plan. Our fiber build plans include significant expenditures which could be adversely impacted by supply chain delays, inflation, and other risks. In addition to higher costs, the availability of building materials and other supply chain risks could negatively impact our ability to achieve the fiber build plans we are executing against.
Our strategy focuses on four levers of value creation: fiber deployment, fiber broadband penetration, operational efficiency, and improving the customer experience. We accomplished the following objectives in 2021:
-We built fiber to approximately 638,000 locations during 2021, resulting in approximately 4 million total locations passed with fiber as of December 31, 2021. Our build plan remains on track and we have solidified our fiber build supply chain with multi-year agreements with key labor and equipment partners.
-We had a record year of approximately 99,000 fiber broadband customer net additions.
-We realized approximately $90 million of gross annualized cost savings and remain on track to deliver approximately $250 million of gross annual cost savings by 2023.
-We made significant strides to improve our customer experience, through internal operating improvements as well as partnerships with leading players in the industry like Red Ventures, eero, an Amazon company, and YouTubeTV.
Financial Overview
We reported operating income of $762 million and $351 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2021 and the four months ended April 30, 2021, respectively. While the basis of accounting for the Predecessor and Successor are different as a result of applying fresh start accounting, for purposes of discussing our year-to-date operating performance that follows we have presented combined Non-GAAP operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 which will be compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the Remaining Properties. The more significant impacts of fresh start accounting that affect comparability are included in the variance analysis that follows.
We reported Non-GAAP operating income of $1,113 million and operating income of $833 million, excluding the Northwest operations, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $280 million. After adjusting for the impact of fresh start accounting, our Non-GAAP operating income would have increased by $335 million, as compared to 2020. The improvement in our operating results was primarily due to reductions in depreciation and amortization expense, loss on disposal, and decreased video content costs resulting primarily from declines in video customers.

Presentation of Results of Operations
The sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly consumer revenue per customer (“ARPC”), average monthly revenue per unit (“ARPU”), and consumer customer churn. We define churn as the number of consumer customer deactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average of each monthly churn in the period. Management believes that consumer customer counts and average monthly revenue per customer are important factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer customers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide additional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting our customers’ communications needs.
The following charts present key customer metrics, disaggregation of revenue, and the results of operations of the consolidated company including the Northwest Operations (Northwest Ops) through the date of sale. The results of operations for the Northwest Operations are shown separate from the total for our operations located in the remaining 25 states (Remaining Properties).

Customers
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a reduction in customers of approximately 3%.
The average monthly consumer revenue per customer (“consumer ARPC”) decreased $2.82, or 3%, to $84.70 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. After adjusting for the fresh start impact of approximately $1.46, consumer ARPC decreased by $1.36, compared to 2020.
The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily a result of decreased video services along with decreased consumer voice services, slightly offset by increased fiber data. This ARPC trend is expected to continue as our customer mix becomes more weighted towards broadband service. We have de-emphasized the sale of low margin video products, which have been a material part of the overall ARPC.
Fiber Broadband Customers
The Company has initiated an investment strategy focused on expanding and improving its fiber network. In conjunction with this strategy, the Company is also working to improve its product positioning in both existing and new fiber markets.
Although still in the initial stages of this fiber investment strategy, results are promising as the quarter ended December 31, 2021 represents the tenth consecutive quarter of positive fiber net adds. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Frontier added 98,000 consumer fiber broadband customers compared to 33,000 in 2020. Customers who migrated from our copper base constituted a minor portion of these consumer fiber broadband customer net additions in 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Frontier added 1,000 business fiber broadband customers compared to zero in 2020.
Our focus on expanding and improving our fiber network is contributing to improved customer retention. Our average monthly consumer fiber broadband churn was 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 1.71% in 2020. The improvements in customer churn were also impacted by our increased focus on customer retention at key customer touchpoints such as installation, first bill, and end of promotion periods.
In addition to our sequential improvement in fiber net adds, we continue to see improvements in the average monthly consumer fiber broadband revenue per customer which increased $4.55, or 8%, to $62.34 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. These increases are due to price increases and shifting mix towards higher speed tiers.
Copper Broadband Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Frontier lost 115,000 consumer copper broadband customers compared to a loss of 92,000 in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Frontier lost 19,000 business copper broadband customers compared to a loss of 25,000 in 2020. The 2021 improvement is partially due to the full year impact of improved churn metrics that began in 2020, as customer switching behavior slowed during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained low. The improvement has also been positively impacted by customer retention initiatives.
Our average monthly consumer customer churn was 1.72% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2.11% in 2020. The reductions in customer churn were primarily driven by customer retention initiatives and also reflect the impact of COVID-19.

Our revenue streams are primarily a result of recurring data, voice, and video services delivered over either our copper or fiber network. Revenues are considered copper or fiber based on the “last-mile” technology used to connect the customer location. With our investment strategy to expand and improve our fiber network and the corresponding fiber focus of our sales and marketing efforts, the company is experiencing growth in fiber broadband revenue and a decline in copper revenue. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate due to strong fiber demand and the migration of customers from copper to fiber once the fiber network is available.

We conduct business with a range of consumer, business, and wholesale customers, and we generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues are primarily billed at fixed recurring rates, with some services billed based on usage. Revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of the provision for expected credit losses.
Consumer
Consumer customer losses were driven by reductions in our copper broadband and stand-alone voice customers, offset by net additions of fiber broadband customers. Customer preferences, as well as our fiber investment initiative, are resulting in a migration for our customer base from copper to fiber.
For the year ended December 30, 2021, Frontier lost 99,000 consumer customers, compared to a loss of 148,000 consumer customers in 2020. This includes net losses of consumer broadband customers of approximately 17,000 and 59,000 during those same periods, respectively. These improvements in the rate of decline of our consumer broadband customers are a result of our fiber expansion initiatives, and we expect to return to overall consumer broadband customer growth by the end of 2022.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a 7% decline in consumer revenues, as compared to 2020. This decline was driven by a 3% decrease in the number of customers and a 3% decrease in ARPC. This decline was driven predominantly by decreases in voice, video, and copper broadband, offset by increases in fiber broadband.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a 12% improvement in consumer fiber broadband revenues. This improvement is a result of our fiber initiatives which resulted in net adds of 98,000 customers, and our continued focus on product positioning in both new and existing markets, which resulted in ARPU improvements of $4.55 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced an approximately 1% decline in consumer copper broadband revenues, compared to 2020. As our copper footprint is transitioned to fiber, we expect fewer copper sales opportunities.
Business
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a 9% decline in our business and wholesale revenues, as compared to 2020. Contributing to this decline, wholesale revenues decreased due to lower rates for our network access services charged to our wholesale customers. Our small and medium business (“SMB”) and enterprise revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decline in small business customers.

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five categories:
Data and Internet Services
We provide data and Internet services to our consumer, business, and wholesale customers. Data and Internet services consist of fiber broadband services, copper broadband services, and network access revenues (data transmission services and dedicated high-capacity circuits including data services to wireless providers commonly called wireless backhaul). Network access services, which constitute approximately one third of this revenue category, are provided primarily to our business and wholesale customers, while fiber and copper broadband, which constitute nearly two thirds of the revenue category, are provided to all customer segments.
Our fiber expansion strategy is expected to positively impact data and Internet services. This network expansion will provide faster, symmetrical broadband speeds, and provide customer and revenue growth opportunities for fiber broadband and certain network access products like ethernet. This initiative will create opportunities for us to provide more fiber-based services to our customers.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the accumulated balances in deferred installation fee revenue were eliminated as part of fresh start accounting, which has resulted in a decline in revenue recognition. After adjusting for this fresh start accounting impact, data and Internet services revenue decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020.
The revenue declines were primarily driven by Frontier’s network access revenue and were offset by 4% improvement in our broadband revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. The increases in broadband revenue were driven by growth in fiber, offset somewhat by continued declines in copper. The Network access revenues declines were the result of an ongoing migration of our carrier customers from legacy technology circuits to lower priced ethernet circuits.
The decrease in data and Internet services revenue continued to improve for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2021, as a result of the Company’s initiatives.
FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Voice services
The Company provides voice services consisting of traditional local and long-distance service and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service provided over our fiber and copper broadband products. It also includes enhanced features such as call waiting, caller identification, and voice messaging services.

Upon implementation of fresh start accounting policies, Frontier is recording both revenue and expense related to USF surcharges on a net basis, as opposed to recording each on a gross basis prior to emergence. After adjusting for the impact of these revenues, voice services revenue declined $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. These declines were primarily due to net losses in business and consumer customers in addition to fewer customers bundling voice services with broadband.
Video services
Video services include revenues generated from traditional television (TV) services provided directly to consumer customers as well as satellite TV services provide through Dish. Video services also includes pay-per-view revenues, video on demand, equipment rentals, and video advertising. The Company has made the strategic decision to limit sales of new traditional TV services, focusing on our broadband products and OTT video options. We are partnering with OTT video providers and expect this to grow as OTT options are offered with our broadband products.

31, 2021, as compared to 2020. Additionally, the accumulated balances in deferred installation fee revenue were eliminated as part of fresh start accounting, which has resulted in a $23 million decline in revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. After adjusting for the impacts of these policy changes, other customer revenue declined $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. These decreases were primarily driven by reductions in late payment fees, early termination fees and reconnect fees. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we divested our CPE business. The divestiture is expected to impact annualized revenue by approximately $50 million but will have an immaterial impact on profitability.

Cost of Service
Cost of service expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network, video content costs and certain promotional costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude depreciation and amortization, and employee related expenses.
As a result of the fresh start accounting policy change to account for USF fees and certain other surcharges and taxes on a net basis instead of on a gross basis in both revenue and expense, cost of service decreased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. After adjusting for this fresh start change, cost of service declined $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in cost of service expense was driven by lower video content costs as a result of declines in video customers, non-renewal of certain content agreements and decreased CPE costs.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A expenses) include the salaries, wages and related benefits and costs of corporate and sales personnel, travel, insurance, non-network related rent, advertising, and other administrative expenses. Also included are expenses associated with the delivery of services to customers and the operation and maintenance of our network, such as facility rent, utilities, maintenance and other costs, as well as salaries, wages and related benefits associated with personnel who are responsible for the delivery of services, and the operation and maintenance of our network.
As a result of the fresh start accounting policy change to classify the provision for bad debt as an expense rather than a reduction to revenue, selling, general, and administrative expense was $35 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2021, as
FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
compared to 2020. Additionally, a result of fresh start accounting policy changes, we have expensed $38 million of certain administrative items that were previously capitalized by the predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2021. After adjusting for the fresh start impacts, SG&A expense declined $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was a result of reduced property taxes and lower headcount, partially offset by increased compensation and benefits costs, higher professional services and recruiting fees, and increased utilities costs. Although we are expanding our fiber footprint, our overhead expenses are relatively flat due to our ongoing cost savings initiatives.
Depreciation and Amortization
As a result of fresh start accounting, all of Frontier’s fixed assets and intangible assets were adjusted to fair value as of the emergence from bankruptcy. These changes resulted in decreases to the carrying values of its fixed assets and increases in the carrying value of its intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decreased depreciation and amortization expense was driven by lower depreciation expense as a result of reduced fixed asset bases following the fresh start adjustment noted above. The reduction in depreciation expense was combined with lower amortization expense compared to the prior year, primarily due to the accelerated method of amortizing customer list intangibles during 2020.
Loss on disposal of Northwest Operations
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Frontier recorded a loss on disposal of $162 million associated with the sale of the Northwest Operations.
Restructuring costs and other charges
Restructuring costs and other charges consist of consulting and advisory fees related to our balance sheet restructuring prior to filing our Chapter 11 Cases and subsequent to the Emergence Date, workforce reductions, transformation initiatives, other restructuring expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, restructuring costs and other charges decreased due to a reduction in our consulting and advisory fees related to our balance sheet restructuring when comparing those that were incurred prior to filing our Chapter 11 Cases and those that were incurred subsequent to the emergence from bankruptcy.
Pension and Other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) costs
Frontier allocates pension/OPEB expense, which includes only service costs, to network related expenses and SG&A expenses. Total Non-GAAP consolidated pension and OPEB expense, excluding pension settlement costs and pension/OPEB special termination benefit enhancements, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

Investment and other income (loss), net
Investment and other expense, net increased by $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, driven by higher net non-operating pension and OPEB expense as compared to the prior year. This increase was a result of actuarial losses that were previously amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) prior to emergence, and increased OPEB expense for remeasurement charges of $13 million recognized in May 2021, $54 million recognized in August 2021 and $30 million recognized in December 2021.
Pension settlement
During the year ended December 31, 2020, lump sum pension settlement payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $465 million, which exceeded the settlement threshold of $211 million, and as a result, Frontier recognized non-cash settlement charges totaling $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not exceed the threshold in 2021, and as such, no pension settlement costs were incurred.
Reorganization items, net
The Company has incurred costs associated with the reorganization, primarily the write-off of certain debt issuance costs and net discounts, financing costs, and legal and professional fees and fresh start accounting adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Frontier recognized $4,171 million in reorganization items associated with the restructuring of our balance sheet primarily due to the $11 billion gain associated with the cancellation of debt, offset by other adjustments related to emergence and fresh start accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Frontier incurred $409 million in reorganization costs associated with the restructuring of our balance sheet.
Interest expense
For the year ended December 31, 2021 interest expense decreased $387 million, as compared to 2020. The decline in interest expense was primarily driven by reduced interest rates resulting from the refinancing of our secured debt, the unrecorded interest related to our unsecured notes prior to emergence from bankruptcy, and the overall reduction in our principal debt balance. The weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2021 was 5.702%.
Income tax expense (benefit)
During the four months ended April 30, 2021, the Predecessor recorded an income tax benefit of $136 million on pre-tax income of $4,405 million. The driver for the benefit was the tax effect of fresh start accounting adjustments. During the eight months ended December 31, 2021. Successor recorded income tax expense of $86 million on pre-tax income of $500 million. Our effective tax rates for the four months ended April 30, 2021 and the eight months ended December 31, 2021 were 3.1% and 17.2%, respectively.

(b) Liquidity and Capital Resources
Frontier emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases on April 30, 2021 with a new capital structure consisting of significantly lower levels of long-term debt as compared to the Company’s historical debt levels. The reorganization resulted in the elimination of approximately $11 billion of our long-term debt and a corresponding decrease in the capital needed for debt service requirements. Following emergence, we expect that our principal uses of cash and will be to fund the cost of operations, working capital, and capital expenditures and to fund interest payments on our long-term debt.
Analysis of Cash Flows
As of December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents aggregating $2,127 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and cash from prior year borrowings principally to fund payments related to our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and our cash investing and financing activities, which were primarily capital expenditures.
On October 13, 2021, our consolidated subsidiary Frontier Communications Holdings, LLC, issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.0% second lien secured notes due 2030 in an offering pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund capital investments and operating costs arising from the Company’s fiber build and expansion of its fiber customer base, and for general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a working capital surplus of $1,237 million compared to a $4,486 million deficit at December 31, 2020. The primary driver for the change in the working capital surplus at December 31, 2021 was classification of our long-term debt as current as a result of the Chapter 11 restructuring.
Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities
Non-GAAP combined cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $1,192 million to $797 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. The overall decrease in operating cash flows was primarily the result of payments of excess cash to unsecured senior noteholders and payments of prepetition accounts payable following our emergence from bankruptcy totaling $1,169 million.
We paid $37 million in net cash taxes during the year ended December 31, 2021, and $8 million in net cash taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cash Flows used by Investing Activities
Non-GAAP combined cash flows used by investing activities were $1,683 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash flows used by investing activities of $19 million for in 2020. In 2020, we received $1,131 million in proceeds from the sale of the Northwest Operations.
Capital Expenditures
For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our Non-GAAP combined capital expenditures were $1,705 million and capital expenditures were $1,181 million, respectively. Approximately 37% of our capital expenditures in 2021 related to fiber network projects. Capital expenditures related to CAF Phase II are included in our reported amounts for capital expenditures. The driver of the increase in capital expenditures was increased spending for fiber upgrades to our existing copper network, a trend that we expect to continue as we execute our strategy of investing in our fiber network.
Cash Flows provided from (used by) Financing Activities
Cash flows provided from (used by) financing activities increased $2,070 million to $1,177 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase is primarily the result of proceeds from our offering of $1.0 billion second lien secured notes and $225 million in gross proceeds from the exit term loan facility in 2021, offset by full repayment of the Revolver in 2020 of $749 million.
Capital Resources
We emerged from Chapter 11 cases with a new capital structure with significantly lower levels of long-term debt. Upon emergence, our consolidated long-term debt decreased from approximately $16,769 million to $6,738 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $365 million of cash interest.
FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
In connection with the emergence, we paid $1,313 million to Old Frontier’s unsecured senior note holders, $62 million related to prepetition accounts payable and contract cure payments and $22 million for professional fees and other bankruptcy related costs.
Prospectively, our primary anticipated uses of liquidity will be to fund the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures and to fund interest payments on our long-term debt. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our $625 million Revolving Facility (as reduced by approximately $96 million of Letters of Credit.)
Our Amended and Restricted Credit Agreement, including our $1,464 million Term Loan Facility and $625 million Revolving Facility, and the indentures governing our outstanding secured First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes are described in detail in Note 10 to the financial statements contained in Part I of this report. A summary of certain covenants and our borrowing capacity is provided below.
We have assessed our current and expected funding requirements and our current and expected sources of liquidity, and have determined, based on our forecasted financial results and financial condition as of December 31, 2021, that our operating cash flows and existing cash balances, will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt interest and principal payments, pay taxes and make other payments over the next twelve months. Several factors, including but not limited to, loss of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic conditions including, supply chain and inflationary pressures, may negatively affect our cash generated from operations.
Debt Covenants and Borrowing Capacity
Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes usual and customary negative covenants for loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries’ (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for loan agreements of this type.
Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains a “financial covenant” which provides that Frontier’s first lien leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 3.00:1.00. This financial covenant is only applicable for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) thereunder and failure to comply with the financial covenant would not cause an Event of Default with respect to any loans pursuant to our term loan facility unless and until the Required Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) have declared all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable and all outstanding commitments under the revolving facility to be immediately terminated.
The indentures governing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes also include usual and customary negative covenants for debt securities of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries’ (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for debt securities of this type.
The indentures governing the outstanding subsidiary debentures include covenants that limit such subsidiary’s ability to create liens and/or merge or consolidate with other companies. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our existing indentures and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Net Operating Losses
In connection with the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy, the Company consummated a taxable disposition of substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Company. Certain of the NOLs were utilized in offsetting gains from the disposition, certain of the NOLS were extinguished as part of attribute reduction and certain subsidiary NOLS were carried over. Under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, Predecessor and Successor made elections to step-up tax basis of certain subsidiary assets. Such Section 338(h)(10) elections will generate depreciation and amortization expense going forward, which may result in net operating losses basis. Such net operating losses would be carried forward indefinitely but would be subject to an 80% limitation on U.S. taxable income.
Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements.

Our outstanding performance letters of credit decreased from $139 million to $121 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Letters of credit exclude approximately $57 million of cash held in trust in lieu of issuing letters of credit for Zurich Insurance related claims.
In April 2015, the FCC released its right of first refusal offer of support to price cap carriers under the CAF Phase II program, which is intended to provide long-term support for broadband in high-cost unserved or underserved areas. Frontier accepted the FCC’s CAF Phase II offer in 25 states, which provided $313 million in annual support through 2021, to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to households across some of the 25 states where we operate.
The deployment deadline was December 31, 2021, and final review and audit of households is not complete. To the extent it is determined we did not enable the required number of households with 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service or we were unable to satisfy other FCC CAF Phase II requirements, Frontier will be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other requirements and obligations.
On January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), a competitive reverse auction to provide support to serve high-cost areas. The FCC held the RDOF Phase I auction from October 29, 2020 through November 25, 2020, and announced the results on December 7, 2020. Frontier was awarded approximately $371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations in eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). Frontier submitted its Long Form application to the FCC on January 29, 2021 and, assuming the long-form application is granted by the FCC, anticipates that it will begin receiving funding in 2022, in which case, Frontier will be required to complete the buildout to the RDOF locations six years after funding starts, with interim target milestones over this period. To the extent we do not enable the required number of locations with gigabit-capable broadband service by the end of the RDOF period, or we are unable to satisfy other FCC RDOF requirements, Frontier would be required to return a portion of the funds previously received.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The estimates which require the most significant judgment are listed below.
FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fresh Start Accounting
The Company adopted fresh start accounting and reporting on the Effective Date, in accordance with FASB ASC 852. Upon the application of fresh start accounting, Frontier allocated the reorganization value to its individual assets based on their estimated fair values. Each asset and liability existing as of the Effective Date, other than deferred taxes, have been stated at the fair value, and determined at appropriate risk-adjusted interest rates. Deferred taxes were determined in conformity with applicable accounting standards.
Reorganization value represents the fair value of the Successor’s assets before considering liabilities. Our reorganization value is derived from an estimate of enterprise value. Enterprise value represents the estimated fair value of an entity’s long-term debt and shareholders’ equity. In support of the Plan, the enterprise value of the Successor was estimated to be approximately $12.5 billion. The valuation analysis was prepared using financial information and financial projections and applying standard valuation techniques, including a risked net asset value analysis.
Fair values of assets and liabilities represent our best estimates based on independent appraisals and valuations. These estimates and assumptions were subject to significant uncertainties beyond our reasonable control. In addition, the market value of our common stock may differ materially from the fresh start equity valuation.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations, including payment history, customer financial performance, carrier billing disputes and aging analysis. Our estimation process includes general and specific reserves and varies by customer category. In 2021 and 2020, we had no “critical estimates” related to bankruptcies of communications companies or any other significant customers. See Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Depreciation
The calculation of depreciation expense is based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our property, plant, and equipment assets. The estimates for remaining lives of the various asset categories are determined annually, based on an independent study. Among other considerations, these studies include models that consider actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution for each category of asset. The latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and did not result in any significant changes in remaining lives for any of our asset categories. A one-year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment would result in an increase of approximately $87 million to depreciation expense.
See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Asset Impairments
We review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists, finite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When triggering events are identified, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required.
We considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets, and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain finite-lived intangible assets were impaired, noting no impairment was present as of or for the year ended December 31, 2021.

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former employees as well as other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. As of December 31, 2021, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $1,718 million. During 2021, we contributed $42 million to these plans in cash and recorded $103 million of operating expense before capitalization, and $4 million of net non-operating income. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields.
We are utilizing a discount rate of 2.90% as of December 31, 2021 for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 2.60% and 3.40% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2021 was 3.00% compared to a range of 2.60% to 2.80% in 2020 and 3.40% to 3.50% in 2019.
In the following table, we show the estimated sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2021:

$
In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5-year, 10-year and 20-year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 40% in long-duration fixed income securities, and 60% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%. Our actual return on plan assets for the four months ended April 30, 2021 was 2.88% and for the eight months ended December 31, 2021 it was 5.97%. For 2022, we expect to assume a rate of return of 7.50%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date.
For additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefits (see Note 20 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Income Taxes
We file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in governing law or review by taxing authorities.
We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we are not able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.
The tax effect of a change in tax law or rates included in income tax expense from continuing operations includes effect of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities initially recognized through a charge or credit to other comprehensive income. The residual tax effects typically are released when the item giving rise to the tax effect is
FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
disposed of, liquidated, or terminated. Since the Company has adopted the portfolio approach to release the residual tax effects, there is no release for the residual tax effect from the sale of our Northwest Operations in 2020.
