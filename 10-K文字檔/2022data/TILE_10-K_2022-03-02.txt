ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 1, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and it is anticipated that this will continue for an indefinite period of time. The duration of the pandemic will ultimately determine the extent to which our operations are impacted. We continue to monitor our operations and have implemented various programs to mitigate the effects on our business including reductions in employees, labor costs, marketing expenses, consulting expenses, travel costs, various other costs, and capital expenditures, as well as reducing the amount of the cash dividend that we pay on our common stock. We continue to focus on the impact COVID-19 has on our employees in accordance with the Company’s ongoing safety measures, as well as any local government orders and “shelter in place” directives in place from time to time.
During fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had less of an impact on our overall financial results as consolidated net sales increased 8.8% compared to fiscal year 2020. Government stimulus programs, increased COVID-19 vaccination rates, and fewer COVID-19 related restrictions in some places contributed to a rebound in economic activity in certain countries driving higher revenues globally compared to fiscal year 2020. The sales increase in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily in non-corporate office market segments, including healthcare, education, retail, residential / living and transportation. Our global supply chain and manufacturing operations, however, experienced increased adverse impacts and disruptions in 2021 from COVID-19. These impacts included raw material shortages, raw material cost increases, higher freight costs, shipping delays, and labor shortages - particularly in the United States. These impacts to our supply chain and manufacturing operations increased our costs, decreased our ability to achieve manufacturing targets, increased lead times to our customers, and adversely affected our gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales. Management believes it is reasonably likely these impacts will continue and affect our future operations and results to some degree, particularly during the first half of 2022.
During fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 17.9% lower consolidated net sales compared to fiscal year 2019. We temporarily suspended production in certain manufacturing facilities in 2020 due to government lockdowns, shelter in place orders and reduced demand. Our sales mix shifted towards more non-corporate office market segments as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced corporate spending, which impacted sales in the corporate office market. During 2020, the Company recorded $12.9 million of voluntary and involuntary severance costs, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
In fiscal year 2020, government grants and payroll protection programs were available in various countries globally to provide assistance to companies impacted by the pandemic. The CARES Act enacted in the United States (see Note 17 entitled “Income Taxes” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information) and a payroll protection program enacted in the Netherlands (the “NOW Program”) provided benefits related to payroll costs either as reimbursements, lower payroll tax rates or deferral of payroll tax payments. The NOW Program provided eligible companies with reimbursement of labor costs as an incentive to retain employees and continue paying them in accordance with the Company’s customary compensation practices. During fiscal year 2020, the Company qualified for benefits under several payroll protection programs and recognized a reduction in payroll costs of approximately $7.3 million, which were recorded as a $6.1 million reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses and a $1.2 million reduction of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations, as the Company believes it is probable that the benefits received will not be repaid.
During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of changes in macroeconomic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized a charge of $121.3 million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.
Executive Overview
Our revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products, primarily modular carpet, luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) and rubber flooring products. Our business, as well as the commercial interiors industry in general, is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space. The commercial interiors industry, including the market for floorcovering products, is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces. In significant part, the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations. As a result, macroeconomic factors such as employment rates, office vacancy rates, capital spending, productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general, also affect our business.
During fiscal year 2021, the Company largely completed its integration of the nora acquisition, and integration of its European and Asia-Pacific commercial areas and determined that it has two operating and reportable segments - namely Americas (“AMS”) and Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia (collectively “EAAA”). The AMS operating segment is unchanged from prior year and continues to include the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic areas. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The results of operations discussion below also includes segment information.
We focus our marketing and sales efforts on both corporate office and non-corporate office market segments, to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely, as well as to capture additional market share. More than half of our consolidated net sales were in non-corporate office markets in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, primarily in education, healthcare, government, retail, and residential/living market segments. See Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our mix of modular carpet and resilient flooring sales in corporate office verses non-corporate office market segments for the last three fiscal years by reportable segment.
During 2021, we had consolidated net sales of $1,200.4 million, up 8.8% compared to $1,103.3 million in 2020, primarily due to the rebound in economic activity in certain countries following the impacts of COVID-19. Consolidated operating income for 2021 was $104.8 million compared to consolidated operating loss of $39.3 million in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in 2021 and a $121.3 million impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets in 2020. Fiscal year 2021 also included $3.9 million of restructuring charges in connection with the planned closure of our Thailand manufacturing operations anticipated to occur in 2022. Consolidated net income for 2021 was $55.2 million or $0.94 per share, compared to consolidated net loss of $71.9 million, or $1.23 per share, in 2020.
During 2020, we had consolidated net sales of $1,103.3 million, down 17.9% compared to $1,343.0 million in 2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. The consolidated operating loss for 2020 was $39.3 million compared to consolidated operating income of $130.9 million in 2019, due primarily to a $121.3 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19. The consolidated net loss for 2020 was $71.9 million, or $1.23 per share, compared to consolidated net income of $79.2 million, or $1.34 per share, in 2019.
A detailed discussion of our 2021 and 2020 consolidated and segment performance appears below under “Analysis of Results of Operations”.
Analysis of Results of Operations
Consolidated Results
The following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections.
Consolidated net sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 50% in 2021, 51% in 2020, and 49% in 2019. Because we have substantial international operations, we are impacted, from time to time, by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions. In 2021, the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our net sales and operating income. In 2020, the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound sterling, and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our net sales and operating income. In 2019, the weakening of the Euro, British Pound sterling, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our net sales and operating income.
The following table presents the amounts (in U.S. dollars) by which the exchange rates for translating Euros, British Pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Chinese Renminbi and Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars have affected our consolidated net sales and operating income or loss during the past three years:
The following table presents, as a percentage of net sales, certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations during the past three years:
Consolidated Net Sales
Below we provide information regarding our consolidated net sales and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years. Fiscal year 2021 included 52 weeks, fiscal year 2020 included 53 weeks, and fiscal year 2019 included 52 weeks.
Consolidated net sales for 2021 compared with 2020
For 2021, our consolidated net sales increased $97.1 million (8.8%) compared to 2020, comprised of higher sales volumes (approximately 5.1%) and higher prices (approximately 3.7%). Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a positive impact on our year-over-year consolidated sales comparison of approximately $23.9 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year over year our 2021 sales would have been lower by this amount. On a market segment basis, the sales increase was most significant in non-corporate office market segments including retail, education and healthcare. See the segment results discussion below for additional information on market segments.
Consolidated net sales for 2020 compared with 2019
For 2020, our consolidated net sales decreased $239.8 million (17.9%) compared to 2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting in lower sales volumes globally. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a positive impact on our year-over-year sales comparison of approximately $7.1 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year over year, our 2020 sales would have been lower by this amount. On a market segment basis, the decrease in consolidated net sales was primarily in the corporate office, retail, hospitality and healthcare market segments. See the segment results discussion below for additional information on market segments.
Consolidated Cost and Expenses
The following table presents our consolidated cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses during the past three years:
For 2021, our consolidated costs of sales increased $75.0 million (10.8%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher net sales and the continued adverse impacts of COVID-19. Currency translation had a $16.2 million (2.3%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. In 2021, the impact of COVID-19 continued to challenge our global supply chain which contributed to higher cost of sales and lower gross profit margins - particularly in the United States. As a percentage of net sales, our consolidated costs of sales increased to 64.0% in 2021 versus 62.8% in 2020, primarily due to inflationary pressures on raw materials, freight and labor costs driving an approximately 3.4% increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior year. The increase in our consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by productivity efficiencies during the year. Management believes it is reasonably likely the inflationary pressures experienced in 2021 will continue to some degree in 2022, particularly in the first half of 2022.
For 2020, our consolidated costs of sales decreased $117.4 million (14.5%) compared with 2019, primarily due to lower net sales. Currency translation had a $4.7 million (0.6%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. As a percentage of net sales, our consolidated costs of sales increased to 62.8% in 2020 versus 60.3% in 2019, primarily due to changes in fixed cost absorption driven by lower production volumes due to the impacts of COVID-19.
For 2021, our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $8.9 million (2.7%) versus 2020. Currency translation had a $5.3 million (1.6%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. Consolidated SG&A expenses were lower in 2021 primarily due to (1) lower legal fees and other related costs of $12.6 million primarily due to the settlement of the SEC matter in the prior year period, and (2) lower severance costs of $9.1 million as the prior year included additional cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to COVID-19 as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by higher labor costs of approximately $11.0 million due to higher performance-based compensation as target performance measures were achieved in 2021, partially offset by cost savings from prior year headcount reduction initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 27.0% in 2021 versus 30.2% in 2020.
For 2020, our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $55.9 million (14.4%) versus 2019. Currency translation had a $1.5 million (0.4%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. Consolidated SG&A expenses were lower in 2020 primarily due to (1) lower selling expenses of $54.8 million due to lower net sales, (2) $7.3 million of payroll expense credits related to COVID-19 wage support government assistance programs, and (3) $9.2 million lower performance-based compensation due to stock compensation forfeitures and target performance measures not being met due to COVID-19. These reductions were partially offset by $12.9 million of severance expenses due to voluntary and involuntary separations, and a $5.0 million fine to settle the SEC matter as referenced in Item 8 Note 18 - “Commitments and Contingencies”. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 30.2% in 2020 versus 29.0% in 2019, primarily due to lower net sales.
Restructuring Plans
On September 8, 2021, the Company committed to a new restructuring plan that continues to focus on efforts to improve efficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations. The plan involves a reduction of approximately 188 employees and the closure of the Company’s carpet tile manufacturing facility in Thailand, anticipated to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2022. As a result of this plan, the Company expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges between the third quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2022 of approximately $4 million to $5 million. The expected charges are comprised of severance expenses ($2.2 million), retention bonuses ($0.5 million), and asset impairment and other charges ($2.0 million). The costs of retention bonuses of approximately $0.5 million will be recognized through the end of fiscal year 2022 as earned over the requisite service periods. Restructuring charges of $3.9 million comprised of severance and asset impairment charges were recognized during the third quarter of 2021.
The Thailand plant closure is expected to result in future cash expenditures of approximately $3 million to $4 million for payment of the employee severance and employee retention bonuses and other costs of the shutdown of the Thailand manufacturing facility, as described above. The Company expects to complete the restructuring plan in fiscal year 2022 and expects the plan to yield annualized savings of approximately $1.7 million. A portion of the annualized savings is expected to be realized on the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year 2022, with the remaining portion of the annualized savings expected to be realized in fiscal year 2023.
On December 23, 2019, the Company committed to a new restructuring plan to improve efficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations, and more closely align its operating structure with its business strategy. The plan involved a reduction of approximately 105 employees and early termination of two office leases. As a result of this plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 of approximately $9.0 million. The charge was comprised of severance expenses ($8.8 million) and lease exit costs ($0.2 million). The restructuring charge was expected to result in future cash expenditures of approximately $9.0 million for payment of these employee severance and lease exit costs. The Company expected the plan to yield annualized savings of approximately $6.0 million. A portion of the annualized savings was realized on the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year 2020, with the remaining portion of the annualized savings realized in fiscal year 2021.
On December 29, 2018, the Company committed to a new restructuring plan in its continuing efforts to improve efficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations, and more closely align its operating structure with its business strategy. The plan involved (i) a restructuring of its sales and administrative operations in the United Kingdom, (ii) a reduction of approximately 200 employees, primarily in the Europe and Asia-Pacific geographic regions, and (iii) the write-down of certain underutilized and impaired assets that included information technology assets and obsolete manufacturing equipment. The restructuring plan was completed at the end of fiscal year 2020.
Goodwill, Intangible Asset and Fixed Asset Impairment
During 2021, we recognized a fixed asset impairment charge of $4.4 million for projects that were abandoned. During 2020, we recognized a charge of $121.3 million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. During 2020, we also recognized fixed asset impairment charges of $5.0 million primarily related to certain FLOR design center closures and other projects that were abandoned or indefinitely delayed. These charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Interest Expense
For 2021, our interest expense increased $0.5 million to $29.7 million, versus $29.2 million in 2020, primarily due to (1) higher fixed-rate interest expense on the Senior Notes debt, which replaced variable-rate debt under the Syndicated Credit Facility, and (2) $4.9 million of deferred losses recognized on terminated interest rate swaps that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense during the year. These increases were partially offset by $60 million of lower outstanding borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility compared to 2020. Our average borrowing rate under the Syndicated Credit Facility was 1.91% for 2021 compared to 1.89% in 2020.
For 2020, our interest expense increased $3.6 million to $29.2 million, versus $25.6 million in 2019, primarily due to (1) a $3.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt to amend the Syndicated Credit Facility and repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness thereunder, and (2) a $3.9 million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss for deferred interest rate swap losses due to the termination of interest rate swap contracts. These increases were partially offset by lower average interest rates on our borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility (our average borrowing rate for 2020 was 1.89% compared to 3.27% in 2019) and lower outstanding borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility compared to 2019.
Other Expense
Other expenses decreased $8.4 million during fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a $4.2 million write-down of damaged raw material inventory in 2020, which resulted from a fire at a leased storage facility.
Tax
For the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $17.4 million on pre-tax income of $72.6 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.0%, as compared to an income tax benefit of $7.5 million on pre-tax loss of $79.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.4% for the year ended January 3, 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended January 3, 2021 was significantly impacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken in prior years on discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on discontinued operations, the effective tax rate was 14.1% for the year ended January 3, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended January 2, 2022 as compared to the year ended January 3, 2021 was primarily due to the one-time favorable impacts of amending prior year tax returns during the period ended January 3, 2021, an increase in non-deductible employee compensation and an increase in the valuation allowance on net operating loss and interest carryforwards. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in non-deductible business expenses.
For the year ended January 3, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $7.5 million on pre-tax loss of $79.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.4%. The effective tax rate for this period was significantly impacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken in prior years on discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on discontinued operations, the effective tax rate was 14.1% for 2020 compared to 22.2% in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate, excluding the goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on discontinued operations, was primarily due to the favorable impacts of amending prior year tax returns, retroactive election of the GILTI High-tax Exclusion in the 2019 tax return and reduction in non-deductible employee compensation. This decrease was partially offset by the non-deductible SEC fine.
Segment Results
As discussed above, in fiscal year 2021 the Company determined that it has two operating and reportable segments - AMS and EAAA. Segment information presented below for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 have been restated to conform to the new reportable segment structure. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
AMS Segment - Net Sales and Adjusted Operating Income (“AOI”)
The following table presents AMS segment net sales and AOI for the last three fiscal years:
(1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses. Excludes non-recurring items related to intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring, asset impairment, severance and other costs. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
AMS segment net sales for 2021 compared with 2020
During 2021, net sales in AMS increased 9.7% versus 2020, comprised of higher sales volumes and higher prices. On a market segment basis, the AMS sales increase was most significant in non-corporate office market segments including healthcare (up 19.1%), retail (up 19.1%) and education (up 18.3%). Sales in the corporate office market increased 6.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the hospitality (down 38.3%) and public buildings (down 20%) market segments.
AMS segment net sales for 2020 compared with 2019
During 2020, net sales in AMS decreased 21.6% versus the comparable period in 2019. The AMS sales decrease in 2020 was due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 and lower carpet tile sales volumes. On a market segment basis, the sales decrease in the Americas was most significant in the corporate office (down 33.8%), retail (down 34.8%), healthcare (down 15.2%) and education (down 8.3%) market segments, partially offset by increases in the residential living (up 23.8%) and public buildings (up 8.2%) market segments.
AMS AOI for 2021 compared with 2020
AOI in AMS decreased 4.6% during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher cost of sales as a result of inflationary pressures on raw materials, freight and labor costs driving an approximately 3.0% increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior year. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by productivity efficiencies during the year. AOI as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased to 13.1% compared to 15.0% in 2020 due to the global supply chain pressures discussed above.
AMS AOI for 2020 compared with 2019
AOI in AMS decreased 26.3% during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 which resulted in lower sales volumes in 2020. The decrease in AOI was also partially due to costs related to the closure of the FLOR stores in 2020.
EAAA Segment - Net Sales and AOI
The following table presents EAAA segment net sales and AOI for the last three fiscal years:
(1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses. Excludes non-recurring items related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, purchase accounting amortization, restructuring, asset impairment, severance and other costs. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
EAAA segment net sales for 2021 compared with 2020
During 2021, net sales in EAAA increased 7.7% versus 2020, comprised of higher sales volumes and higher prices. Currency fluctuations had an approximately $21.5 million (4.2%) positive impact on EAAA’s 2021 sales compared to 2020 due to the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound sterling, Australian dollar and the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the EAAA sales increase was most significant in non-corporate office market segments including retail (up 53.8%), public buildings (up 30.2%) and healthcare (up 19.0%). Sales in the corporate office market increased 2.4% in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the education (down 2.6%) market segment.
EAAA segment net sales for 2020 compared with 2019
During 2020, net sales in EAAA decreased 13.0% versus 2019, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 and lower carpet tile sales volumes. Currency fluctuations had an approximately $7.3 million (1.3%) positive impact on EAAA’s fiscal year 2020 sales compared with 2019, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the EAAA sales decrease was most significant in the hospitality (down 40.3%), corporate office (down 19.1%), public buildings (down 16.0%) and retail (down 12.9%) market segments.
EAAA AOI for 2021 compared with 2020
AOI in EAAA increased 74.1% during 2021 versus 2020. Currency fluctuations had an approximately $3.1 million (6.4%) positive impact on AOI for 2021. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 23.0% in 2021 compared to 24.6% in 2020 due to savings from cost reduction initiatives implemented in the prior year. AOI as a percentage of net sales increased to 6.8% in 2021 compared to 4.2% in 2020, due primarily to higher sales as discussed above.
EAAA AOI for 2020 compared with 2019
AOI in EAAA decreased 25.8% during 2020 versus 2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 which resulted in lower sales volumes in 2020. Currency fluctuations had an approximately $0.9 million (1.4%) positive impact on AOI for 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
In our business, we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs, in addition to funding normal course SG&A expenses, anticipated capital expenditures, interest expense and potential special projects. We generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings or letters of credit under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes discussed below. We anticipate that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our obligations for the next 12 months and we expect to generate sufficient cash to meet our long-term obligations.
Below is a summary of our material cash requirements for future periods:
Historically, we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year, as we pay insurance premiums, taxes and incentive compensation and build up inventory in preparation for the holiday/vacation season of our international operations. As outlined in the table above, we have approximately $79.2 million in material contractual cash obligations due by the end of fiscal year 2022, which includes, among other things, scheduled debt repayments under the Syndicated Credit Facility, pension contributions, interest payments on our debt and lease commitments. Our long-term debt obligations include the contractually scheduled principal repayment of our term loan borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility, which matures in 2025, and $300 million on our Senior Notes due in 2028. Operating and finance lease obligations consist of undiscounted lease payments due over the term of the lease. Expected interest payments are those associated with borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes consistent with our contractually scheduled principal repayments. Our purchase obligations are for non-cancellable agreements primarily for raw material purchases and capital expenditures. Our current and long-term pension obligations include contributions and expected benefit payments to be paid by the Company related to certain defined benefit pension plans and excludes the expected benefit payments for two of our funded foreign defined benefit plans as these obligations will be paid by the plans over the next ten years.
Based on current interest rates and debt levels, we expect our aggregate interest expense for 2022 to be between $27 million and $28 million. We estimate aggregate capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $30 million, although we are not committed to these amounts.
Liquidity
At January 2, 2022, we had $97.3 million in cash. Approximately $1.7 million of this cash was located in the U.S., and the remaining $95.6 million was located outside of the U.S. The cash located outside of the U.S. is indefinitely reinvested in the respective jurisdictions (except as identified below). We believe that our strategic plans and business needs, particularly for working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in Europe, Asia, and Australia, support our assertion that a portion of our cash in foreign locations will be reinvested and remittance will be postponed indefinitely. Of the $95.6 million of cash in foreign jurisdictions, approximately $12.9 million represents earnings which we have determined are not permanently reinvested, and as such we have provided for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes on these amounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
As of January 2, 2022, we had $225.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our Syndicated Credit Facility, of which $217.6 million were term loan borrowings and $7.5 million were revolving loan borrowings. Additionally, $1.6 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the Syndicated Credit Facility at the end of fiscal year 2021. As of January 2, 2022, we had additional borrowing capacity of $290.9 million under the Syndicated Credit Facility and $6.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under our other credit facilities in place at other non-U.S. subsidiaries.
On November 17, 2020, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Senior Notes”), which are discussed further below. As of January 2, 2022, we had $300.0 million of Senior Notes outstanding.
It is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in November of 2025 and the Senior Notes, as discussed below, mature in December 2028. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes.
It is also important for you to consider that borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility comprise a substantial portion of our indebtedness, and that these borrowings are based on variable interest rates (as described below) that expose the Company to the risk that short-term interest rates may increase. During 2020, we entered into fixed rate Senior Notes (as described below) which reduced the amount of indebtedness subject to interest rate risk. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we terminated our interest rate swaps that were previously being used to fix a portion of our variable rate debt.
