Overview
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 10, 2020 for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from March 9, 2021 through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $3,564,767 which consists of operating costs of $3,078,172, a loss on warrant liability of $304,599, warrant costs of $261,155, interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $115,544 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $36,385.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On March 9, 2021, we consummated the Public Offering of 28,750,000 Units which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $287,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,000,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $7,500,000.
Following the Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $287,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $16,388,918 in Public Offering related costs, including $5,750,000 of underwriting fees, $10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees and $576,418 of other costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $1,227,472. Net loss of $3,564,767 was affected by a non-cash charge related to the change in warrant liability of $304,599 interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $115,544 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $36,385 and offering costs allocable to warrant liabilities of $261,155. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $1,850,700 of cash for operating activities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $287,579,158 (including $115,544 of interest income and unrealized losses of $36,385 consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less). Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2021, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the Trust Account.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $35. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.
We will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our initial stockholders, officers or directors. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through one year and one day from the issuance of this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, administrative and support services. We began incurring these fees on March 4, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and our liquidation.
We have entered into an agreement, pursuant to which we will pay the Vice President a total of $10,000 per month for assisting us in negotiating and consummating an initial business combination. Upon completion of the business combination or the Company’s liquidation, the agreement will terminate and the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per unit, or $10,062,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Warrant Liability
We account for the warrants issued in connection with our Public Offering in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40-15-7D under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, we classify the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a Binomial Lattice Model.
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our condensed balance sheets.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture.
The Company's statement of operations applies the two-class method in calculating net income per share. Basic and diluted net income per ordinary share for Class A ordinary share and Class B ordinary share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares of Class A ordinary share and Class B ordinary share outstanding, allocated proportionally to each class of common stock.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements.
