Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
OVERVIEW
We empower healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences and are committed to building a healthier world, one person at a time. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products, related accessories and a digital platform for consumer use, primarily in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Bowflex®, Schwinn®, JRNY® and Nautilus®.
We market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers primarily through websites. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies to reach consumers in the home use markets in the U.S. and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.
Our results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") were driven by the actions outlined in our North Star strategy. The five strategic pillars of our North Star strategy are: (1) adopt a consumer first mindset; (2) scale a differentiated digital offering; (3) focus investments on core businesses; (4) evolve supply chain to be a strategic advantage; and (5) build organizational capabilities to win by unleashing the power of our team. We intend to leverage our many strengths to transform into a company that empowers healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. Our transformation will build on our leading brands, products, innovation, distribution and digital assets to create a healthier world, one person at a time.
At the center of health and well-being is fitness. The market size more than doubled over the past two years, is normalizing from its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic with more normal seasonality, and will settle at a “new normal” significantly above pre-pandemic levels based on a profound evolution in consumers’ workouts and workplace habits. As a result of these changed habits and sentiments, we continue to believe much of the industry growth opportunity will remain at elevated levels relative to those experienced pre-pandemic. This results in stronger opportunities for the fitness industry and Nautilus.

•In fiscal 2022, approximately 80% of total units sold were connectable to JRNY®, compared to only 22% in fiscal 2020.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Our results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry, customer buying patterns, product innovation, the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products, our ability to procure products to meet customer demand, the level of spending on, and effectiveness of, our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things, the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the U.S. and Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic had created a heightened need for home-fitness products at an unprecedented rate and then as the pandemic lessened there was a return to a more normal seasonality. We cannot predict with certainty the longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to consumer habits and sentiments and therefore, the impact on our results of operations is uncertain. Our gross margins are being impacted by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products, tariffs, expedited shipping and transportation costs. Gross margins may also be affected by fluctuations in cost associated with the acquisition or license of products and technologies, product warranty claims, fuel, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing-related services. Our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Historically, our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and distribute advertisements of our products on television, websites and other media, facility costs, operating costs of our information and communications systems, product supply chain management, customer support and new product development activities. In addition, our operating expenses have been affected from time-to-time by asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses.
As a result of the above and other factors, our period-to-period operating results may not be indicative of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies, both within and outside our industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and, consequently, we cannot assure you any future growth or profitability. For more information, see our discussion of Risk Factors located at Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Results from discontinued operations relate to the disposal of our former Nautilus® Commercial business, which was completed in April 2011. We reached substantial completion of asset liquidation at December 31, 2012. Although there was no revenue related to the Commercial business in 2022, 2021 and 2020, we continue to incur product liability expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel, and accrued interest associated with an uncertain tax position on discontinued international operations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (ii) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Our critical accounting estimate is discussed below.
Goodwill and Other Long-Term Assets Valuation
We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets, including acquired trade names, customer relationships, patents and patent rights, and other long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"), we recognized a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $72.0 million primarily related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived Octane Fitness brand name which was sold October 14, 2020. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recognized no goodwill impairment.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of either of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.
Our impairment evaluations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including: the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows; market conditions; relative levels of risk; the cost of capital; terminal values; royalty rates; and the allocation of revenues, expenses and assets and liabilities to reporting units. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or other long-term assets and, thereby, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We make judgments about the recoverability of intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
The fair value of acquired technology, which was determined at the acquisition date, primarily uses the cost approach. Other third party costs were also provided and considered in our analysis, where appropriate. In addition to the costs to reproduce each application, a developer's profit, an opportunity cost and an obsolescence factor were considered. The developer's profit represents the profit margin on a market participate developer's investment in the material, labor and overhead costs necessary to develop the intangible asset.

Sales and Gross Profit
Direct Segment
Comparison of the year-ended March 31, 2022 to the twelve-months ended March 31, 2021
Net sales were $221.7 million for 2022, compared to $295.3 million, a decline of 24.9%, versus the same period in 2021. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower cardio sales.
Cardio sales declined 39.6% versus the same period in 2021. Lower cardio sales were primarily driven by lower bike sales. Strength product sales grew 13.0% versus the same period in 2021. Higher strength sales were primarily driven by increased sales of SelectTech® weights and benches.
The Direct segment ended the year with $0.8 million of backlog as of March 31, 2022. Backlog represents unfulfilled consumer orders net of current promotional programs and sales discounts.
Gross profit margin was 30.7% for 2022 versus 53.4% for the same period in 2021. The 22.7 ppt decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by: increased product costs, logistics and discounting (-19 ppts) and increased investments in JRNY® (-4 ppts). Gross profit was $68.1 million, a decrease of 56.8% versus the same period in 2021.
Segment contribution loss was $15.7 million for 2022, compared to segment contribution income of $86.0 million for 2021. The decline was primarily driven by lower gross profit and increased investments in media and JRNY®. Advertising expenses were $42.1 million in 2022 compared to $30.9 million for the same period in 2021.
Combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers were 56.7% in 2022 compared to 52.5% in 2021. The increase in approvals reflects higher credit quality applications.

Net sales were $364.1 million for 2022, compared to $365.9 million, a decline of 0.5%, versus the same period in 2021. Excluding sales related to Octane, net sales increased 5% compared to the same period in 2021. Retail segment sales outside the United States and Canada decreased 13%, or a decrease of 9% excluding Octane.
The decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower demand for our bikes and higher sales discounting, partially offset by strong sales of SelectTech® weights and benches.

Operating (Loss) Income
Operating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $143.4 million, as compared to an operating income of $118.1 million for 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and increased operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $1.6 million and $1.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, was primarily related to the outstanding balance on our term loan and line of credit.
Other, Net
Other, net includes the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations with the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries and equity investment impairments.
Other, net for 2022 was $1.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, as compared to $5.0 million in 2021. The decrease in other, net was primarily due to an equity investment impairment for the fair value deterioration from adverse changes in the general market condition of the equity investees' industry of $2.5 million in 2021.
(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations
Loss from continuing operations was $28.2 million for 2022, or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $112.1 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.
As of March 31, 2022, we had $14.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale securities of $113.2 million as of March 31, 2021.
Cash used in operating activities was $66.6 million for fiscal 2022, compared to cash used in operating activities of $71.7 million for the comparable period ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to our net loss for fiscal 2022 and the changes in our operating assets and liabilities discussed below.
Trade receivables decreased by $27.2 million to $61.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $88.7 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to timing of customer payments.
Inventory increased by $43.1 million to $111.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $68.1 million as of March 31, 2021. The increase in inventory was driven by the strategic decision to increase on-hand inventory levels for the fitness season given continued disruption in global logistics. About 14% of inventory as of March 31, 2022 was in-transit.
Prepaids and other current assets decreased by $11.3 million to $14.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $25.8 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in other short-term deposits for inventory.
Trade payables decreased by $45.7 million to $53.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $98.9 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to the timing of payments and slow down in inventory purchases.
Accrued liabilities increased by $9.8 million to $29.4 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $19.6 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to deferred subscription revenue, an accrued loss contingency related to a class action lawsuit legal settlement, payroll related liabilities and customer deposits.
Cash provided by investing activities of $34.4 million in fiscal 2022 was related to the proceeds of marketable securities of $73.4 million, $13.1 million used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022, primarily for information technology assets, our digital platform JRNY® and production tooling and equipment, offset by business acquisition costs of $26.0 million.
Cash provided by financing activities of $12.7 million in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to proceeds from long-term debt of $65.2 million and proceeds from stock purchases and stock option exercises of $1.0 million, offset by payments on our term loan and line of credit of $49.9 million, tax payments related to stock award issuances of $2.9 million and debt issuance costs of $0.6 million.
Financing Arrangements
Wells Fargo Bank Credit Agreement
On October 29, 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement dated January 31, 2020, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with Wells Fargo the “Lenders”) (the “Credit Agreement”), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed, among other things, to make available to us an asset-based revolving loan facility, subject to a borrowing base (the “ABL Revolving Facility”), and a term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility” and together with the ABL Revolving Facility, the “Credit Facility”), in each case, as such amounts may increase or decrease in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The amendment increased the aggregate principal amount available under the ABL Revolving Facility from $55.0 million to $100.0 million (the “Revolver”), subject to a borrowing base. The maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to October 29, 2026. The unamortized balance on the Term Loan was $11.5 million, as of the effective date of the amendment, and will amortize on a new 60-month straight line basis to coincide with the extended maturity date. In connection with the credit amendment we recorded $0.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs as Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The repayment of obligations under the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets. Principal and interest amounts are required to be paid as scheduled.
Other structural improvements to the Credit Agreement include amending the definition of Springing Trigger Event to mean the greater of (i) 10.0% of the lesser of (a) the Revolver Commitment and (b) the Borrowing Base as of such date of determination and (ii) $7.5 million. The Springing Trigger Event pertains to the period in which a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test will apply and be tested. Consistent with the Credit Agreement before the amendment, there continues to be no additional financial maintenance covenants. Additionally, the borrowing base definitions were favorably amended to change the eligible in-transit inventory sublimit from $10.0 million to $22.5 million and the total inventory sublimit from $35.0 million to $65.0 million.
As of March 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings totaled $29.4 million, with $10.1 million and $19.3 million under our Term Loan Facility and Revolver, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and $65.8 million was available for borrowing under the ABL Revolving Facility.
Interest on the Revolver will accrue at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a margin of 1.86% to 2.36% (based on average quarterly availability) and interest on the Term Loan Facility will accrue at SOFR plus 4.61%. As of March 31, 2022, our interest rate was 2.16% for the Revolver and 4.91% for the Term Loan Facility.
The balance sheet classification of the borrowings under the revolving loan credit facility has been determined in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit agreement that include a requirement to maintain a springing lock-box arrangement are classified based on the provisions of ASC 470 because the lock-box remittances do not automatically reduce the debt outstanding.

On November 9, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (“Shelf Registration”) with the SEC under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions. We have not made any offerings of securities under the Shelf Registration.
Commitments and Contingencies
For a description of our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Non-Cancellable Contractual Obligations
Our operating cash flows include the effect of certain non-cancellable contractual obligations. A summary of such obligations as of March 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands):
(1) Our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments to our third-party manufacturers. Because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from Asia, we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced by individual purchase orders.
Due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2022, we are unable to make reasonable reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $4.1 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, have been excluded from the contractual table above. For further information, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions.
The nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract, and generally a maximum obligation is not stated. We hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications. Because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation, and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no liabilities are recorded at March 31, 2022.
INFLATION
We are subject to the effects of inflation through elevated supply chain costs, including logistics costs. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, our business could be more affected by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
