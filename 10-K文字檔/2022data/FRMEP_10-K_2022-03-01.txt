OVERVIEW
First Merchants Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a financial holding company headquartered in Muncie, Indiana and was organized in September 1982. The Corporation’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq’s Global Select Market System under the symbol FRME. The Corporation conducts its banking operations through First Merchants Bank (the “Bank”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that opened for business in Muncie, Indiana, in March 1893. The Bank also operates First Merchants Private Wealth Advisors (a division of First Merchants Bank). The Bank includes 109 banking locations in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. In addition to its branch network, the Corporation offers comprehensive electronic and mobile delivery channels to its customers. The Corporation’s business activities are currently limited to one significant business segment, which is community banking.
Through the Bank, the Corporation offers a broad range of financial services, including accepting time, savings and demand deposits; making consumer, commercial, agri-business, public finance and real estate mortgage loans; providing personal and corporate trust services; offering full-service brokerage and private wealth management; and providing letters of credit, repurchase agreements and other corporate services.
HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2021
•Net income available to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $205.5 million compared to $148.6 million for the year ended 2020, an increase of 38.3 percent.
•Earnings per fully diluted common share for 2021 totaled $3.81 compared to $2.74 for 2020, an increase of 39.1 percent.
•The Corporation experienced organic loan growth of $566.4 million, or 6.6 percent during 2021, which when offset by a $560.5 million decline in Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans (following forgiveness by the Small Business Administration), resulted in net loan growth of $5.9 million.
•As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $12.7 billion in total deposits, representing a $1.4 billion increase from December 31, 2020, or 12.1 percent.
•During 2021, the Corporation repurchased 646,102 of its common shares for $25.4 million at an average price of $39.38.
•During the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation completed its previously-announced banking delivery transformation strategy, which included the consolidation of seventeen banking centers across its footprint.
•On April 1, 2021, the Bank acquired 100 percent of Hoosier Trust Company (“Hoosier”) through a merger of Hoosier with and into the Bank. The consideration paid to shareholders of Hoosier at closing was $3,225,000 in cash. Prior to the acquisition, Hoosier was an Indiana corporate trust company, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, with approximately $290 million in assets under management. Hoosier’s sole office is now being operated by the Bank as a limited service trust office.
•On November 4, 2021, the Corporation and Level One Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan corporation (“Level One”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Level One will, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, merge with and into the Corporation (the “Merger”), whereupon the separate corporate existence of Level One will cease and the Corporation will survive. Immediately following the Merger, Level One's wholly owned subsidiary, Level One Bank, will be merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon the Merger becoming effective, the common shareholders of Level One will be entitled to received, for each outstanding share of Level One common stock, (a) a 0.7167 share (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the Corporation’s common stock, in a tax-free exchange, and (b) a cash payment of $10.17. The Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalization, or similar transactions, or as otherwise described in the Merger Agreement.
Based on the number of shares of Level One common stock currently outstanding, the Corporation expects to issue approximately 5.5 million shares of its common stock, and pay approximately $77.7 million in cash, in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares of Level One common stock. In addition, the Corporation expects to issue 10,000 shares of a newly created 7.5% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $2,500 per share, in exchange for the outstanding Level One Series B preferred stock. Based on the closing price of First Merchants’ common stock on November 3, 2021, of $43.50 per share, the implied value for a share of Level One common stock is $41.35. The aggregate transaction value is estimated at approximately $323.5 million.
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have granted approvals in connection with the transaction. However, consummation of the Merger remains subject to the requisite approval of the holders of Level One common stock, the approval of the Indiana DFI, and satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The shareholders of Level One are considering the approval of the Merger Agreement on March 1, 2022, and the Indiana DFI expects to meet during March 2022 to consider the matter. The parties are diligently pursuing satisfaction of the other closing conditions and expect the closing to occur by early second quarter of 2022, subject to satisfaction of those conditions.
