Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our
consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. We
intend for this discussion to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements,
the changes in key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those
changes.
Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including
information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See the section of this Annual Report titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk
Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from management’s
expectations and the results
described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
Vaxxinity is engaged in the development and commercialization of
rationally designed prophylactic and
therapeutic vaccines to combat
chronic disorders
and infectious
diseases with
large patient
populations and
unmet medical
needs. While
vaccines have
traditionally
been unable
to effectively
and safely
combat such
disorders, we
believe our
platform could
overcome the
traditional hurdles
facing
vaccines in this area.
Our Vaxxine
Platform relies on a synthetic peptide vaccine technology first developed by UBI and subsequently
refined over the last two decades. We
believe our vaccines have the potential to combat
conditions that have not yet been successfully
treated, or
which have
primarily been
addressed with
monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) which,
while generally
effective, are
extremely
costly and
cumbersome, and
thus have
limited accessibility.
Our pipeline
primarily consists
of five
programs focused
on chronic
disease,
particularly neurodegenerative
disorders, in
addition to
other neurology
and cardiovascular
indications. Given
the global
COVID-19
pandemic and
our Vaxxine
Platform’s
applicability to
infectious disease,
we are
also opportunistically
advancing product
candidates
that address SARS-CoV-2.
We separated our
business from
UBI through
two separate
transactions: a
spin-out from
UBI in
2014 of
operations focused
on developing
chronic
disease
product
candidates
that
resulted
in
UNS,
and
a
second
spin-out
from
UBI
in
of
operations
focused
on
the
development of a COVID-19 vaccine that
resulted in COVAXX.
On February 2, 2021, Vaxxinity
was incorporated for the purpose of
reorganizing
and combining
UNS and
COVAXX
and did
so on
March 2,
2021 through
the Reorganization.
In connection
with the
Reorganization, (i) all outstanding shares of UNS and COVAXX preferred stock and common stock were contributed to Vaxxinity
and
exchanged for an aggregate
of 57,702,458 shares of
our Class A common
stock, 10,999,149 shares of
our Class B common
stock and
58,175,751
shares of our Series
A preferred stock, (ii) the
outstanding options to purchase
shares of UNS and COVAXX common stock
were terminated
and substituted
with options
to purchase
an aggregate
of 19,712,504
shares of
our Class
A common
stock, (iii)
the
outstanding warrant to purchase shares of
COVAXX
common stock was cancelled and exchanged for
a warrant that is exercisable for
112,373
shares of
our Class
A common
stock, and
(iv) the
outstanding Convertible
Notes and
the Related
Note were
contributed to
Vaxxinity and the former holders of such notes received an aggregate
of
4,047,344
shares of our Series A preferred
stock. As a result of
the Reorganization, COVAXX
and UNS became our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All shares of our
Series A preferred stock converted
into shares of
our Class A
common stock concurrently
with the closing.
The Reorganization was
determined to be
a common control
transaction, so the
carrying values of
all contributed assets
and assumed liabilities
remained unchanged and
the financial information
for
all
periods in
this
section of
the
financial
statements presented
prior to
the
Reorganization
are presented
on
consolidated basis.
COVA
XX was
incorporated on
March 23,
2020, so
periods prior
to March
23, 2020
in this
section of
the financial
statements only
reflect the historical financial information of UNS. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this section we use the terms “Vaxxinity,”
“we,” “us” and “our” to refer to our operations (including through UNS and COVAXX) both prior to and after the Reorganization.
Since our spin-out transactions from UBI, we have focused on
organizing and staffing our business, business planning,
raising capital,
developing
our
Vaxxine
Platform,
identifying
and
testing
potential
product
candidates
and
conducting
clinical
trials.
We
have
also
developed a SARS CoV-2 antibody ELISA test, which received an EUA from the FDA in January 2021.
Our current pipeline consists
of six programs from early
to late-stage development, including
five programs focused on
chronic disease.
Our neurodegenerative chronic disease program has three primary programs: UB-311, our leading neurology product candidate, which
targets AD; UB-312, which
targets PD and other
synucleinopathies;
and an anti-tau product
candidate which has
the potential to address
multiple neurodegenerative conditions, including AD.
Additionally, we
have two other primary
programs focused on chronic
disease:
UB-313, which targets CGRP
to prevent migraines;
and our anti-PCSK9
program, which targets
hypercholesterolemia to reduce
the risk
of cardiac events.
Through our
Vaxxine Platform, we believe
we may
be able
to address a
wide range
of other
chronic diseases,
including
chronic diseases that are or could potentially be successfully treated by mAbs, which increasingly dominate the treatment
paradigm for
many chronic diseases.
In addition
to our
chronic disease
pipeline, given
our Vaxxine
Platform’s
applicability to
infectious disease
and the
global need
for
additional vaccines
to address
SARS-CoV-2, we are advancing
an infectious
disease product
candidate. We have reported
interim results
of our
UB-612 Phase
1, Phase
2, and
Phase 1
extension clinical
trials. An
EUA application
for UB-612
was denied
by the
TFDA in
August 2021. We are appealing
the TFDA’s decision in partnership with UBIA.
At the same
time, we are
pursuing accelerated pathways
to authorization with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, including high income countries and LMICs, based on a heterologous booster
trial of UB-612 in the first half of 2022.
To date,
our revenue has been
generated from the modest
sales of our ELISA
test and the sale
of an option to negotiate
a license with
UNS (which
option has
expired). As
a result,
our ability
to generate
revenue sufficient
to achieve
profitability will
depend on
the eventual
regulatory approval,
and commercialization
of one
or more
of our
product candidates.
We have not yet
obtained any
regulatory approvals
for our product candidates or conducted sales and marketing activities for our product candidates.
We have principally funded our operations through financing transactions. Through December 31, 2021,
we received gross proceeds of
$306.1 million
in
connection with
various financial
instruments, including
the sale
of preferred
and common
stock, the
issuance of
promissory notes (including
convertible promissory notes
(“Convertible Notes”)), and
the entry into
simple agreements for
future equity
(“SAFEs”).
Costs associated with research and development are the most significant
component of our expenses. These costs can vary greatly from
period to period depending
on the timing of
various trials for our
product candidates. We expect our allocated
research and development
costs and
general and
administrative expenses
to increase
over time
as we
expand the
number of
product candidates
that we
are advancing
and incur
increased costs as
a result of
operating as
a public company.
Further, we
anticipate incurring greater
selling and marketing
expenses if we
commercialize any of
our product candidates
in the future.
Our product candidates
are in clinical
stage or pre-clinical
stage development, and we
have generated limited revenue
to date and
have incurred significant
operating losses since inception.
Net
losses were $137.2 million and
$40.0 million for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021,
we had an
accumulated deficit of
$229.5 million. We expec
t our expenses
and capital requirements
will increase over
time in connection
with our planned operations, which include:
•
continuing pre-clinical studies, existing clinical trials, or initiating new clinical trials for product candidates UB-311, UB-312,
UB-313, our COVID-19 product candidate and other product candidates;
•
advancing
the
development
of
our
product
candidate
pipeline
of
other
product
candidates,
including
through
business
development efforts to invest in or in-license other technologies or product candidates;
•
hiring additional clinical, quality control, medical, scientific and other technical personnel to support clinical and research and
development programs;
•
expanding operational, financial
and management systems
and infrastructure, expanding
our facilities and
increasing personnel
to support operations;
•
undertaking actions to meet the requirements and demands of being a public company;
•
maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio;
•
seeking regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; and
•
undertaking pre-commercialization activities to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product
candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we elect to commercialize products on our own or
jointly with third parties.
As of
the date of
this Report, we
expect our existing
cash and
cash equivalents will
be sufficient
to fund
our operating
expenses and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the
next 12 months. We
also believe that cash and cash equivalents will
enable us to fund
our operating expenses
and capital expenditure
requirements into 2023.
Thereafter, our viability will
be dependent on
our ability to raise
additional capital to
finance operations, to
successfully commercialize our
product candidates and/or
to enter into
collaborations with
third parties for the
development of our product candidates.
If we are unable
to do any of
the foregoing, we would be
forced to delay,
limit, reduce or terminate our product candidate development or future commercialization efforts. Our estimates are based on
a variety
of assumptions
that may
prove to
be wrong,
and we
could exhaust
our available
capital resources
sooner than
expected. See
“- Liquidity
and Capital Resources.”
Business Update Regarding COVID-19 Pandemic
In March
2020, the
World
Health Organization
declared the
COVID-19 outbreak
a pandemic.
The onset
of the
pandemic led
to our
institutional
prioritization
of
COVID-19
vaccine
development
efforts,
which
correlated
to
a
decline
in
research
and
development
expenditures for our chronic disease product candidates. To
date, our operations have not been negatively impacted
by the COVID-19
pandemic in a material manner. However, at this time, we cannot predict the specific extent, duration or full impact that the COVID-19
pandemic will have
on our financial
condition and operations,
but the development
of clinical supply
materials could be
delayed and
enrollment of patients in our studies may be delayed or suspended, as hospitals and clinics in areas where we are conducting trials shift
resources
to
cope
with
the
COVID-19
pandemic
and
may
limit
access
or
close
clinical
facilities
due
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
Additionally, if our trial participants
are unable to
travel to our
clinical study sites
as a result
of quarantines or
other restrictions resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience
higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical
studies. The impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on
our financial
performance will
depend on
future developments,
including the
duration and
spread of
the pandemic
and
related
governmental
advisories
and
restrictions.
These
developments
and
the
impact
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
on
the
financial
markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the financial markets and/or
the overall economy are
impacted for an extended period,
our results may be
materially adversely affected. See
“Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our
Business
and
Industry-The
ongoing
coronavirus
pandemic
has
caused
interruptions
or
delays
of
our
business
plan.
Delays
caused
by
the
coronavirus pandemic may have a significant adverse effect on our business.”
Components of Our Consolidated Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue for the years
ended December 31, 2021
and 2020 was $0.1
million and $0.6 million,
respectively, and consisted of commercial
sales of our ELISA
tests. While we continue to
expect some revenue from sales
of our ELISA tests,
we do not expect
to generate any
meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory
approval of and commercialize our product candidates, and we
do not know
when, or
if, this
will occur.
If our
development efforts
for our
product candidates
are successful
and result
in commercialization,
we
may generate additional
revenue in the
future from a
combination of product
sales or payments
from collaboration or
license agreements
that we have entered
into or may enter
into with third parties.
See Risk Factors-Risks Related
to the Discovery and
Development of
Product Candidates.
We
have incurred significant
losses since our
inception. We
expect to incur
losses for the
foreseeable future and
may never achieve or maintain profitability.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue
consists of kit
production costs consisting
of materials, labor
and overhead expenses
directly related to
ELISA tests sold
and the costs of expired ELISA tests, which are not available for commercial sale.
If our development efforts
in respect of our current pipeline
of product candidates are successful and
result in regulatory approval, we
expect our cost
of revenue will
increase in relative
proportion to the
level of our
revenue as we
commercialize the applicable product
candidate. We
expect that
cost of
revenue will
increase in
absolute dollars
as and
if our
revenue grows
and will
vary from
period to
period as a percentage of revenue.
Research and Development Expenses
The design, initiation and execution of
candidate discovery and development programs
of our future potential product candidates
is key
to our
success and
involves significant
expenses. Prior
to initiating
these programs,
project teams
incorporating individuals
from the
essential disciplines within
Vaxxinity scope out the activities, timing,
requirements, inclusion and
exclusion criteria and
the primary and
secondary endpoint. Once we have decided
to proceed, our Vaxxine
Platform enables the iteration of drug candidates
in the discovery
phase through rapid,
rational design and
formulation. After we
have identified drug
candidates, the costs
of scaling the
formulation from
research grade
to clinical
grade, then
to commercial
grade, typically
consumes significant
resources. In
addition, to
internal research
and development, we utilize service providers, including related parties, to complete activities we do not
have the internal resources to
handle.
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for research activities, including drug discovery efforts and the
development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include:
•
expenses incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with CROs that are primarily engaged in the oversight and conduct of our clinical trials,
preclinical studies and drug discovery efforts and contract manufacturers that are primarily engaged to provide preclinical
and clinical drug substance and product for our research and development programs;
•
other costs related to acquiring and manufacturing materials in connection with our drug discovery efforts and preclinical
studies and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation batches, as well as investigative sites and consultants
that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;
•
payments made in cash or equity securities under third-party licensing, acquisition and option agreements;
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees
engaged in research and development functions;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facilities-related costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include rent and utilities.
We
recognize external
development
costs based
on
an evaluation
of
the progress
to
completion of
specific
tasks using
information
provided to us
by service providers.
This process involves
reviewing open contracts
and purchase orders,
communicating with personnel
to identify services
that have been
performed on
our behalf and
estimating the
level of service
performed and the
associated cost incurred
for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Any
nonrefundable advance payments that we
make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses.
Such amounts are expensed as the
related goods are delivered or the
related services are performed, or until
it is no longer expected that
the goods will be delivered or the services rendered, at which point the net remainder is expensed.
We are heavily
reliant on related parties for the advancement of our research and development programs, including for manufacturing,
quality
control,
testing,
validation,
supply
services,
research
support,
development
and
clinical
functions.
During
the
years
ended
December 31, 2021
and 2020, related
party expenses were
approximately 29% and
56% of our
operating expenses, respectively.
We
expect this reliance on related parties to diminish significantly in the future.
Where appropriate,
we allocate
our third-party
research and
development expenses
on a
program-by-program basis.
These expenses
primarily
relate
to
outside
consultants,
CROs,
contract
manufacturers
and
research
laboratories
in
connection
with
pre-clinical
development, process development,
manufacturing and clinical
development activities. We
do not
allocate our internal
costs, such as
employee costs, costs
associated with our
discovery efforts, laboratory
supplies and facilities,
including depreciation or
other indirect
costs, to
specific programs
because these
costs often
relate to
platform development,
to multiple
programs simultaneously
or to
discovery
of new
programs, and
any such
allocation would necessarily
involve significant estimates
and judgments
and, accordingly,
would be
imprecise. When we refer
to the research and development
expenses associated with a specific
program, these refer exclusively
to the
allocated
third-party
expenses
associated
with
that
product
candidate.
All
other
research
and
development
costs
are
referred
to
as
unallocated costs.
Product candidates in
later stages of
clinical development generally
have higher development
costs than those
in earlier stages
of clinical
development,
primarily
due
to
the
increased
size
and
duration
of
later-stage
clinical
trials.
Additionally,
greater
research
and
development overhead is
required to support
broader and more
rapid development of
our Vaxxine Platform and new product
candidates.
As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we
continue our existing and planned clinical trials
and conduct
increased pre-clinical and
clinical development activities,
including submitting regulatory
filings for product
candidates,
and focus more
generally on the
development of our
chronic disease product candidates.
A significant driver of
such increases would
be the initiation of our
Phase 2b trial for UB-311.
We
currently expect to initiate a
Phase 2b early AD efficacy
trial in the second half
of 2022. If we
decide to advance UB-311 through the
clinic without a strategic
partner, our costs would increase more
significantly than
if we engage a partner to fund the development of UB-311.
At this time,
we cannot reasonably
estimate or know
the nature, timing
and costs of
the efforts that
will be necessary
to complete the
pre-clinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from
any of our product candidates
General and Administrative Expenses
General
and
administrative
expenses
consist
primarily
of
salaries
and
benefits,
travel
and
stock-based
compensation
expense
for
personnel in
executive, business development,
finance, human
resources, legal,
information technology
and administrative functions.
General and administrative expenses also
include facility- related costs as
well as insurance costs and
professional fees for legal, patent,
consulting, investor and public relations, accounting
and audit services and other general operating
expenses not otherwise classified as
research and development expenses. We expense general and administrative costs as incurred.
We also anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of increased costs associated with
being a public company. In each case these increases will likely
include increased costs related to the
hiring of additional personnel and
fees to outside consultants, personnel-related stock-based compensation costs, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses, and, in
the
case
of
public
company-related
expenses,
services
associated
with
maintaining
compliance
with
Nasdaq
listing
and
SEC
requirements, director and officer liability insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.
Other Expense (Income)
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of (i) interest
expense recognized on the note payable
entered into during June 2020 for
the acquisition of an
airplane (the
“2025 Note”),
(ii) interest
expense recognized
on the
Convertible Notes
and (iii)
interest expense
recognized on
other
promissory
notes,
including
$0.1
million
borrowed
from
our
Chief
Executive
Officer
(the
“Executive
Note”)
and
a
related
party
Convertible Note payable
for $2.0 million
in aggregate proceeds
that was received
in three tranches
(the “2018 Related
Notes”). The
Executive Note was repaid
in full in August
2021 and the 2018
Related Notes were converted
into Series A preferred
stock concurrently
with the Reorganization.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes, SAFEs and Series A-1 Warrant
Liability
We
issued a series of Convertible
Notes during the years ended
December 31, 2018 through 2021,
a series of SAFEs during
the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and warrants to purchase shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock (“Series A-1 Warrants”) during
the year ended December 31, 2020, each of which
were measured and accounted for at fair value. We remeasured the fair value of each
of
the
Convertible
Notes,
SAFEs
and
Series
A-1
Warrants
at
each
reporting
date
and
recognize
changes
in
the
fair
value
in
our
consolidated statements of operations. Inputs to the calculation of fair value generally include market and acquisition comparable(s) as
well as other
variables. In connection
with the Reorganization,
all outstanding Convertible
Notes, SAFEs, and
Series A-1 Warrants were
exchanged for
shares of
Series
A preferred
stock, which
were
subsequently exchanged
into shares
of
Class A
common stock
upon
closing of the IPO in November 2021.
Loss on Foreign Currency Translation, Net
Our foreign subsidiaries, which
are wholly-owned by COVAXX and UNS, use the U.S.
dollar as their functional
currency and maintain
records in the local
currency. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities
are remeasured at historical
rates and monetary assets
and liabilities are
remeasured at exchange
rates in effect at
the end of
the reporting period.
Income statement accounts
are remeasured at
average exchange
rates for the reporting period. The resulting gains or
losses are included in foreign currency (losses) gains in
the consolidated financial
statements.
Provision for Income Taxes
We have not recorded any significant amounts related
to income tax but have
reserved $0.6 million of unrecognized
tax benefits against
NOLs. We have not recorded any income tax benefits for the majority of our net losses we incurred to date.
We
account for income
taxes using the
asset and liability
method, which requires
the recognition of
deferred tax assets
and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or our tax returns.
Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are
determined based on the
difference between the financial
statement carrying amounts
and tax basis
of existing assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards, which are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect
in the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The realization of our deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the
generation
of future taxable income, the amount
and timing of which are uncertain.
Valuation
allowances are provided, if, based upon
the weight
of available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some
or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.
As of December 31, 2021,
we continue to maintain
a full valuation allowance
against all of our
deferred tax assets based
on evaluation of all
available evidence.
We
file income tax returns
in the U.S. federal
and state jurisdictions and
may become subject to
income tax audit and
adjustments by
related tax authorities. Our tax
return periods (for entities then
in existence) for U.S. federal income
taxes for the tax years
since 2017
remain open to examination under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and state jurisdictions. We record reserves
for potential tax
payments to various
tax authorities related
to uncertain
tax positions, if
any.
The nature of
uncertain tax positions
is
subject
to
significant
judgment
by
management
and
subject
to
change,
which
may
be
substantial.
These
reserves
are
based
on
a
determination of whether
and how much
a tax benefit
taken by us
in our tax
filings or positions
is more likely
than not to
be realized
following the resolution of any potential contingencies related to the tax benefit. We develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions,
and the associated cumulative probabilities, using internal
expertise and assistance from third-party experts.
As additional information
becomes
available,
estimates
are
revised
and
refined.
Differences
between
estimates
and
final
settlement
may
occur
resulting
in
additional tax expense. Potential
interest and penalties
associated with such
uncertain tax positions is
recorded as a
component of our
provision for income taxes.
Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Consolidated Results of Operations
On March 2,
2021, Vaxxinity entered into the Contribution
and Exchange Agreement,
pursuant to which
the outstanding equity
interests
of
UNS
and
COVAXX
were
contributed
to
Vaxxinity
in
return
for
equity
interests
in
Vaxxinity,
resulting
in
UNS
and
COVAXX
becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Vaxxinity.
Accordingly, all share and per share amounts prior to the Reorganization have been
adjusted to reflect the Reorganization. In
addition, we formed COVAXX, and commenced our COVAXX business, on March 23, 2020.
As a result,
the historical financial information
between March 23, 2020
and March 2,
2021 described in
this Annual Report refers
to
the combined historical financial
information of UNS
and COVAXX
and the historical financial
information prior to March
23, 2020
described in this Annual Report refers only to the historical financial information
of UNS. Our operations for the year ended December
31, 2021 reflects the
operations of UNS and
COVAXX businesses on a consolidated basis for the period
from January 1, 2021
to March
1, 2021
and of
Vaxxinity
and its
subsidiaries for
the remainder
of that
twelve-month period.
Our business
operations for
year ended
December 31, 2020 reflects the operations of our UNS business from
January 1, 2020 to March 22, 2020 and our UNS and
COVAXX
businesses on a consolidated
basis for the remainder
of that twelve-month period.
See Note 1 to
our consolidated financial statements

Revenue
Total
revenue
was
$0.1
million
and
$0.6
million
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
2020,
respectively.
All
revenue
and
comparable decreases were due to sales of our ELISA tests. We
are not actively pursuing commercialization of our ELISA tests at this
time.
Gross Margin
The gross margin for
the year ended December
31, 2021 was negative
however the sales
volume was de minimis.
During the year ended
December 31,
2021, we
wrote off
,
to cost
of revenue,
$1.9 million
in expired
ELISA tests
that had
no commercial
value, driving
a
significant change in gross profit percentage.
Research and Development Expenses
Research
and
development
expenses
were
$71.4
million
and
$20.6
million
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
2020,
respectively.
The
$50.8
million
increase
was
primarily
due
to
an
increase
of
$42.6
million
in
costs
related
to
UB-612,
primarily
consisting of materials
and manufacturing costs
and CRO costs associated
with our ongoing clinical
trial in Taiwan, which program
was
only
in
early
development
in
the
corresponding
period.
The
remaining
$8.2
million
increase
was
driven
by
an
increase
in
unallocated costs of $6.2
million, resulting primarily from
increased salaries and personnel-related
costs in connection with
our UB-612
development efforts, as well as an increase in other allocated costs driven primarily by pre-clinical activities for our UB-313 program.
General and Administrative Expenses
General
and
administrative
expenses
were
$51.8
million
and
$12.2
million
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
2020,
respectively. The $39.6 million increase was primarily due to a $28.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, including
$23.1 million related to performance-based grants
that vested upon the successful completion
of the Company’s
initial public offering
in November
2021.
The remaining $11.3
million increase was
due to
increased salaries and
personnel-related costs and
professional
services costs
related to
our continued
organizational growth
to support
our ramp-up
in research
and development
efforts, as
well as
increased costs for preparations for being a public company.
Interest Expense
Interest expense
was $0.8
million and
$1.2 million
for the
years ended
December 31,
2021 and
2020, respectively.
The $0.3
million
decrease was due to the exchange of Convertible Notes for Series A preferred stock in connection with the Reorganization.
Interest Income
Interest income on cash was less than $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes, SAFEs and Series A-1 Warrant
Liability
The decrease in the change in fair value
of the Convertible Notes of $3.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily
related to the revaluation of the Convertible
Notes upon conversion to equity. The increase in the change in fair
value of SAFEs of $7.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to insight into the
pricing of Vaxxinity’s
next stock issuance at a higher valuation. The increase in the change in fair value of Series A-1
Warrants of $0.2
million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2020
was primarily related to an
increase in
value of the Series A-1 preferred
stock. In connection with the
Reorganization, all outstanding Convertible Notes,
SAFEs and Series A-
1 Warrants were exchanged into shares
of Series A preferred
stock, which were
subsequently exchanged into
shares of Class
A common
stock upon the closing of
the IPO in November 2021
as described in Note 8
to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere
in this Report.
Loss on Foreign Currency Translation, Net
The net loss
of foreign currency translation
reflected a de minimis
increase in the foreign
exchange rate for the
year ended December
31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We have generated limited
revenue from sales
of our ELISA
tests and have
not yet commercialized
any of our
product candidates, which
are in
various phases
of pre-clinical
and clinical
development. We have financed
operations primarily
through the
issuance of
convertible
preferred stock, borrowings under promissory
notes (including Convertible Notes) and
the execution of SAFEs. Through
December 31,
2020, we received gross proceeds
of $99.3 million in connection
with the issuance of various
financial instruments, including the sale
of preferred stock,
the issuance of
promissory notes (including
Convertible Notes), and
the execution of
SAFEs. In addition,
we also
generated revenue from the sale
of an option to
negotiate a license with UNS
(which option has expired) and
the sales of ELISA tests
in 2020 and 2021. During
the year ended December 31,
2021, we raised a total
of $198.8 million, which consisted
of $71.1 million in
net proceeds from the issuance of
common stock in connection with the
IPO, $122.8 million in net proceeds
from the issuance of Series
B preferred shares,
$2.0 million in
net proceeds from
the issuance of
convertible debt, and
$2.9 million in
net proceeds from
the issuance
of SAFEs. At December 31, 2021, we had $144.9 million in cash and
cash equivalents, compared to $31.1 million as of December 31,
2020. The increase in cash
and cash equivalents balances
for the periods reported are
primarily due to the factors
described under “Cash
Flows” below.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):

Operating Activities
Net cash
used in
operating activities for
the year
ended December 31,
2021 was
$81.0 million,
primarily due
to a
$137.2 million
net
loss, offset by
a favorable $12.9
million change in
operating assets and
liabilities and total non-cash
items of $43.3
million. The cash
flow impact from changes in net
operating assets and liabilities were primarily
due to $11.4 million
in amounts due to related party as
well as $3.9
million related to
accrued expense, accounts
payable and other
liabilities.
These increases were
offset by
$4.7 million in
prepaid expenses
for UB-612
production. The
primary non-cash
adjustments to
net loss
included an
$11.2
million change
in the
fair
market value of financial instruments as well as $30.4 million of stock-based compensation and $1.1 million in depreciation.
Investing Activities
Net cash used
in investing activities
totaled $1.3 million
for the year
ended December 31,
2021. The cash
used in investing
activities
consisted primarily of the acquisition of equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing
activities totaled $196.2 million
for the year ended December
31, 2021. We raised capital to support our
operations through
the issuance
of Class
A Common
Stock upon
IPO, with
net proceeds
of $71.1
million, the
issuance prior
to the
Reorganization of SAFEs
and Convertible
Notes, with
net proceeds
of $2.9
million and
$2.0 million, respectively,
as well
as the issuance
of Series
B convertible preferred
stock, with net
proceeds of $122.8
million. We
also repaid $2.0
million in relation
to a
Convertible
Note, $0.1 million in relation
to a note payable with
related party, $0.3 million in repayment for
Paycheck Protection Program, and
$0.4
million in relation to a note payable entered into for the acquisition of an Airplane.
Funding Requirements
We
have generated approximately
$3.7 million in
revenue since inception
and have incurred
net losses in
each reporting period
since
inception. We
do not expect to generate
any meaningful revenue unless and until
we obtain regulatory approval of and
commercialize
our product
candidates. We
do not know
when, or if,
this will occur.
If we do
not receive regulatory
approval for any
of our
product
candidates, or
if we
receive approval
but our
commercialization results
fall short
of our
expectations, we
will continue
to incur
significant
losses for the foreseeable future, and we
expect the losses to increase as we
continue the development of, and seek regulatory
approvals
for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products.
As of the date of this Annual Report, we
expect our existing cash and cash equivalents
will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses
over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, other than our 2025 Note, we have no material debt obligations.
We have based
our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use all of
our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,
which include:
•
the number of discovery and pre-clinical programs that we pursue and the speed with which they are advanced;
•
the number, size, and nature of clinical trials that we conduct;
•
the length of time it takes for regulators to review and approve any product candidates that successfully complete clinical
trials;
•
the timing and manner in which we manufacture our pre-clinical and clinical drug material, the terms on which we can have
such manufacturing completed, and the extent to which we undertake commercialization of any drug products, if approved;
•
the extent to which we establish sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product
candidates;
•
the timing and extent to which we expand our operational, financial and management systems and infrastructure, and
facilities;
•
the timing and extent to which we increase our personnel to support operations, including necessary increases in headcount to
conduct and expand our clinical trials, commercialize any approved products and support our operations as a public
company; and
•
the number of patent applications we must file and claims we must defend in order to maintain, expand and protect our
intellectual property portfolio, and the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining
and
protecting our intellectual property rights.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate positive cash flows from operations, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or
private equity offerings, strategic collaborations
and debt financing. To the extent that
we raise additional capital
through the sale of our
Class A common stock, convertible securities
or other equity securities, shareholders’ ownership interest
will be diluted and the
terms
of these securities could include
liquidation or other preferences and
anti-dilution protections. In addition, debt financing,
if available,
may result
in fixed
payment obligations
and may
involve agreements
that include
restrictive covenants
that limit
our ability
to take
specific actions, such as incurring
additional debt, making capital
expenditures, creating liens, redeeming shares
or declaring dividends.
If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations or
marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties,
we
may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that
may
not
be favorable
to
us.
If
we are
unable to
raise
additional funds
when needed,
we
may
be
required to
delay,
limit, reduce
or
terminate our product candidate development or
future commercialization efforts or grant rights
to third parties to develop and
market
product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contract Research and Manufacturing Organizations
We
recorded accrued expenses
of $4.5 million
and $0.3 million
in our balance
sheet for expenditures
incurred by CROs
and contract
manufacturers as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Tax-Related Obligations
We
have reserved
$0.6 million
of unrecognized
tax benefits
against NOLs.
Additionally,
as of
December 31, 2021,
we accrued
$0.2
million in interest and penalties related to prior year tax filings.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods
presented, and do not
currently have, any off-balance
sheet arrangements, as defined
in the rules and
regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported
in our consolidated
financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management
bases its estimates
on historical
experience, market and other conditions,
and various other assumptions it
believes to be reasonable. Although these
estimates are based
on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions
that may impact us in the
future, the estimation process is, by its
nature,
uncertain given that estimates depend
on events over which we
may not have control. In
addition, if our assumptions change,
we may
need to
revise our
estimates, or
take other
corrective actions,
either of
which may
also have
a material
effect on our
consolidated financial
statements. Significant estimates contained within these consolidated financial statements include, but
are not limited to, the estimated
fair
value
of
our
common
stock,
convertible
notes
payable
and
SAFEs,
stock-based
compensation,
warrant
liabilities,
income
tax
valuation allowance
and the
accruals of
research and
development expenses.
We
base our
estimates on
historical experience,
known
trends and other
market-specific or other
relevant factors that
we believe to
be reasonable under
the circumstances. On
an ongoing basis,
management evaluates its estimates, as there are changes in facts and circumstances. If market and other conditions change
from those
that we anticipate, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.
While our
significant accounting policies
are described
in more detail
in the
notes to our
consolidated financial statements
appearing
elsewhere in this
Annual Report,
we believe that
the following
critical accounting
policies and estimates
have a higher
degree of inherent
uncertainty and require our most significant judgments.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process
of preparing our consolidated financial
statements, we are required to
estimate accrued research and
development
expenses. As
we
advance our
programs, we
anticipate more
complex clinical
studies resulting
in greater
research and
development
expenses, which will place even greater emphasis on
the accrual. This process involves reviewing open contracts
and purchase orders,
communicating with our
applicable personnel to
identify services that
have been performed
on our behalf
and estimating the
level of
service performed and the
associated cost incurred for
the service when we
have not yet been
invoiced or otherwise notified
of actual
costs. The majority of
our service providers invoice
in arrears for services
performed, on a pre-determined
schedule or when contractual
milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in
the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that
time. We periodically
confirm the accuracy
of the estimates
with the service
providers and make
adjustments if necessary. Examples
of estimated accrued
research and development
expenses include fees paid to:
•
vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with pre-clinical development activities;
•
CROs and investigative sites in connection with pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; and
•
contract manufacturers in connection with drug substance and drug product formulation of pre-clinical studies and clinical
trial materials.
We
base our
expenses related to
pre-clinical studies and
clinical trials on
our estimates of
the services received
and efforts
expended
pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that supply, conduct and manage pre-clinical studies and
clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of
these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to
contract and may
result
in uneven
payment
flows. There
may
be
instances in
which
payments
made to
our
vendors will
exceed
the
level of
services
provided and result in
a prepayment of the
expense. Payments under some
of these contracts depend
on factors such as
the successful
enrollment of patients and the completion of
clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees,
we estimate the time period over which
services will be performed and
the level of effort
to be expended in each period.
If the actual timing of
the performance of services or
the level
of effort
varies from
the estimate,
it adjusts
the accrual
or the
prepaid expense
accordingly.
Although we
do not
expect our
estimates to be
materially different from
amounts actually incurred,
our understanding of
the status and
timing of services
performed
relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that
are too high or too low
in any particular period. To date, our estimated accruals have not differed materially from actual costs incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure all stock-based awards granted to
employees, directors and non-employees
based on their fair
value on the date
of the grant
and recognize the corresponding compensation
expense of those awards over
the requisite service period,
which is generally the vesting
period of the respective award. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
We grant stock
options and restricted stock awards that are
subject to service vesting conditions.
We
classify stock-based
compensation expense
in our
consolidated statements
of operations
in the
same manner
in which
the award
recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
We estimate the fair value of
each stock option
grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, which
requires the use
of subjective
assumptions
that
could
materially
impact
the
estimation
of
fair
value
and
related
compensation
expense
to
be
recognized.
These
assumptions include (i) the
expected volatility of our
stock price, (ii) the
periods of time over
which recipients are expected
to hold their
options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are
based
on
quoted
U.S.Treasury
rates
for
securities
with
maturities
approximating
the
options’
expected
lives.
Developing
these
assumptions requires the use of judgment. Both prior to and after the IPO, we lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility
information.
Therefore,
we
estimate
our
expected
stock
volatility
based
on
the
historical
volatility
of
a
publicly
traded
set
of
peer
companies. The expected term of the Company’s options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that
qualify
as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected term of options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award.
The expected dividend
yield is zero
as we have
never paid dividends
and do not
currently anticipate paying
any in the
foreseeable future.
Determination of the Fair Value
of Common Stock
Before there was a public market for our common stock, the estimated fair value of common stock was determined by its most recently
available third-party
valuations of
common stock.
These third-
party valuations
were performed
in accordance
with the
guidance outlined
in the
American Institute
of Certified
Public Accountants’
Accounting and
Valuation
Guide, Valuation
of Privately-Held-Company
Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were prepared using an option pricing method (“OPM”).
The
OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the
value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the common
stock
has
value
only
if
the
funds
available
for
distribution
to
stockholders
exceeded
the
value
of
the
preferred
stock
liquidation
preferences at the time
of the liquidity event,
such as a strategic
sale or a merger.
A discount for lack
of marketability of the
common
stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.
In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various
objective and subjective
factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date, including:
•
the prices at which we sold shares of preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to
our common stock at the time of each grant;
•
the progress of our research and development programs, including the status and results of pre-clinical studies and clinical
trials for our product candidates;
•
our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy;
•
external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry and trends within the biopharmaceutical industry;
•
our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and results of operations;
•
the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock;
•
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or our sale in light of prevailing market
conditions; and
•
the analysis of initial public offerings and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.
The assumptions
underlying these
valuations represented management’s
best estimate,
which involved
inherent uncertainties
and the
application of management’s judgment. As a result,
if we had used significantly
different assumptions or estimates, the fair
value of our
common stock and our stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different.
Once a public trading market for
our common stock has been established
for a sufficient period of
time, it will no longer be
necessary
to estimate the
fair value of
our common stock
in connection with
its accounting for
granted stock options
and other such
awards we
may grant, as the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.

Simple Agreement for Future Equity
During the years
ended December 31, 2021
and 2020, we entered
into SAFEs. The SAFEs
were not mandatorily redeemable,
nor did
they
require
us
to
repurchase
a
fixed
number
of
shares.
We
determined
that
the
SAFEs
contained
a
liquidity
event
provision
that
embodied an obligation indexed to the fair value of the equity shares and could require us to settle the SAFE obligation by transferring
assets or cash. Our SAFEs represented a recurring measurement that is
classified within Level 3, disclosed and defined in Note 3 to
our
consolidated financial
statements included
elsewhere in
this Report,
of the
fair value
hierarchy wherein
fair value
is estimated
using
significant unobservable inputs, including
an estimate of the
number of months
to a liquidity
event, volatility rates and
the estimation
of the most likely conversion feature for converting the SAFE.
The fair value of the SAFEs on the date of issuance was determined to equal the proceeds we received. The
value of the SAFEs on the
date of conversion into
Series A preferred stock
was determined to be
equal to the fair
value of the
Series A preferred stock
issued in
connection with the Reorganization.
Convertible Notes
Beginning in 2018, we
issued Convertible Notes
that bore simple interest
at annual rates ranging
from 4.8% to 6%.
All unpaid principal,
together with the
accrued interest thereon,
for the
Convertible Notes were
payable upon the
event of default
or upon maturity,
which
ranged from one to three
years. The Convertible Notes contained
a number of provisions addressing
automatic and optional conversion,
events
of
default
and
prepayment
provisions.
We
determined
that
a
portion
of
the
Convertible
Notes
contained
a
liquidity
event
provision, requiring them to be
measured and accounted for at

Taiwan Centers for Disease Control Grant
UBIA, which is responsible
for applying for and
managing grants on
our behalf, was awarded
a grant by the
Taiwan Centers for Disease
Control (“TCDC”)
for COVID-19
vaccine development.
The grant
provides that
costs incurred to
complete the
two phases of
the clinical
trial will be reimbursed based on the
achievement of certain milestones as defined in the
agreement. We
are entitled to reimbursement
under the TCDC grant.
At each reporting
date, we assess
the status of
all of the
activities involved in completing
the clinical study
in
relation to
the milestones.
We
account for
the amounts
that have
been received
from the
TCDC to
reimburse costs
incurred on
the
clinical study and
not expected
to be
refunded back to
the TCDC as
contra research and
development expenses in
the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.
