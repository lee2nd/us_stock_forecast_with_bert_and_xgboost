Executive Overview
SATIVUS TECH CORP. (f/k/a SEEDO CORP.) (the “Company”, “Our” or “We”) was formed on January 16, 2015, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to September 14th, 2018, we were solely a provider of risk management and asset protection (“RAP”) services for businesses, individuals and families. On September 14th, 2018, (“the Company”) executed an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Eroll Grow Tech Ltd. (“Eroll”), an Israeli Corporation that was formed on May 18th, 2015, under the laws of the state of Israel. On September 17, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an Amendment to its Articles, changing the name of the Corporation to SEEDO CORP. Since the Acquisition of Eroll and through to December 31, 2019, Eroll produced a plant growing device managed and controlled by an artificial intelligent algorithm, allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables effortlessly from seed to plant, while providing optimal conditions to assure premium quality produce year-round. On December 13, 2021, we the Company changed its name to Sativus Tech Corp.
During the third quarter of 2019, Eroll was experiencing financial and operational difficulties and during 2020, entered liquidation proceedings through the Nazareth District Court of the State of Israel (the “Court”). On March 25, 2020, the Court approved the purchase of all of Eroll’s assets by a non-related third-party and therefore, the Company no longer has any legal ties nor privity with Eroll.
Our Business Operations since July 2020
On July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the “New Subco”), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron and other vegetables. On November 5, 2020, the New Subco changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd (or “Saffron”).
The Company, through Saffron Tech, is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products, among others, in the fields of exotic plants and mushrooms. Saffron Tech plans to roll out its proof of concept in the coming months. This technology is designed to provide turnkey automated growing containers for high-quality, high-yield saffron all year round. The Company is in advanced stages of developing and testing a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing high-quality, high-yield saffron anywhere and anytime.
The Company’s proof of concept utilizes the “Grow Next to Consumer” policy and is therefore sustainable and fit the COVID-19 restrictions on transport. It is also environmentally friendly, using economic levels of water, space, fertilizer, and energy. Accounting to the Company’s calculations, we believe that the controlled indoor growing area will produce ten times more yield compared to the same land area using traditional methods. The sealed environment eliminates the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides, producing a clean and safe product that is easy to control from anywhere. The Company’s solution is easily scalable and pre-designed to quickly grow operations.
Saffron is used in many industries, such as the food industry, particularly by famous chefs and Michelin starred restaurants, the natural cosmetics industry and the natural medicine industry and as a dye in the textile industry. Medicinal claims as an anti-depressant, antioxidant, and antiseptic are constantly increasing.
The global saffron market size was valued at $1 Billion in 2019 and is anticipated to attain a revenue based CAGR of 7.3% from 2020 to 2027. The market is expected to grow over the next few years on account of demand from the pharmaceutical sector, particularly in countries with rapid population expansion.
Since the incorporation of Saffron Tech, Saffron Tech has hired three employees and several consultants to commence the roll out of our proof of concept. Saffron Tech has signed several agreements with Israeli companies, including Growin Ltd (“Growin”) and the Israeli Ministry of Agricultures research organization - The Volcani Center (“Volcani”). Growin is an owner of proprietary systems for indoor agriculture and Saffron Tech has acquired the exclusive right to market, sell and commercialize our product based on the Growin’s hydroponic machines. Volcani will assist Saffron Tech in writing the protocols required to grow saffron in a controlled and automated way, including the use of robotics and AI.
On December 8, 2021, Saffron Tech announced it has begun construction of a new state-of-the-art indoor farm that will help increase its production of the saffron spice. Saffron Tech has already successfully completed two harvests of saffron using vertical farming technology at its initial location in Ganot, Israel. The Company's mission with this new facility, located at Mavki'im, Israel, is to complete a third cycle to triple the amount of saffron produced annually. Traditional agriculture only produces one harvest of saffron per year through a labor-intensive process.
On December 9, 2021, FINRA gave final approval for the Company’s 1-for-10 consolidation, or reverse split, of our issued and outstanding common shares, as noted in our 8K of December 13, 2021. Except where otherwise indicated, all share and per share data in this 10-K have been retroactively restated to reflect said consolidation.
On January 6, 2022, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Saffron Tech, has planted approximately 25,000 Saffron bulbs in fields in the Golan Heights, in Norther Israel. The planation is being managed in conjunction with the Shamir Research Institute, which operates under the auspices of the Haifa University, Israel.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Since inception on January 16, 2015, the Company had a cumulative deficit as of December 31, 2021, of $21,077 thousand and we have a working capital deficit of $2,395 thousand as of December 31, 2021. Our future growth is dependent upon achieving further purchase orders and execution, management of operating expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to fund future obligations, and upon profitable operations. Those factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due.
Historically, we have financed our cash flow and operations from the initial contribution of our majority shareholder and by raising equity, convertible loans and warrants. As of December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $866 thousand.
During November and December 2020 and January 2021, the Company continued to raise funds to support its operations and received $955 thousand from third party investors and issued convertible promissory notes in respect thereof (“Promissory Notes”). The Promissory Notes bear no interest, are convertible into Shares based on a fixed conversion price of $1.00 per share and mature between 12 and 24 months from the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, Promissory Notes in the amount of $830,000 have been converted into shares.
On December 24, 2020, Saffron Tech, announced its intention to raise up to 5.2 million New Israeli Shekels (“NIS”) (approximately $1.6 million) at a pre-money valuation of NIS 20 million (approximately $6.225 million) through the Israeli crowd funding platform - Pipelbiz “Crowd Funding Round”). Assuming the maximum amount is raised, the Company will own approximately 80% of the Saffron Tech. The Crowd Funding Round was closed on February 16, 2021, having raised the full amount. Fund raising expenses accumulated to $155 and the net amount raised through Pipelbiz was $1.4 million.
Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, it is our current policy that all transactions between the company and our officers, directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the existing directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders, or are fair to us as a corporation as approved or ratified by the board or authorized officer. We will conduct an appropriate review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis, and, where appropriate, we review the potential of conflicts of interest.
Year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s overall position of cash and cash equivalents increased by $455 thousand. This increase in cash can be attributed to the following:
The Company’s net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, was $1,374 thousand as compared to $316 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is mostly due to a significant increase in the operations of the Company.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $1,856 thousand as compared to $725 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash provided in 2021 was from the receipt of $530 in convertible loans and $1,406 from crowd funding as compared to the receipt of $725 from convertible loans in 2020.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the Company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies are fair value of convertible loans, and the calculation of share-based compensation and going concern.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
