ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTâ€™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Overview
We are a Nevada corporation formed on August 30, 1985. Our headquarters are in Englewood, Colorado. We have been engaged in our current business model since June of 2016, as a result of our having been discharged from a receivership and acquiring Life Marketing, Inc., which was in a different industry as our previous business.
We have experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, including in our current business model. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we ramp up our expansion, which likely will lead to additional losses, until such time that we approach profitability, or which there are no assurances. We have relied on equity and debt financing to fund operations to-date. There can be no guarantee that we will ever become profitable, or that adequate additional financing will be realized in the future or otherwise may be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our expansion efforts. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, of which there are no assurances.
Trends and Uncertainties
Our business is subject to the trends and uncertainties associated with expansion of niche industry social networks and ecommerce solutions are increasing in popularity and availability. At some point, industry saturation of technology solutions that we provide to, and support for TBI participant tech startup companies will make it more difficult for our business model to expand. This will force our company to innovate new technology solutions, which will undoubtedly cost more money to fund.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We had an accumulated deficit of $33,520,912 at December 31, 2021, had a net loss of $2,119,387, and used net cash of $ 310,869 in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand. While we believe that we will be successful generating revenue to fund our operations, meet regulatory requirements and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that we will succeed in our future operations.
We will attempt to overcome the going concern opinion by increasing our TBI licensing to additional tech company startups, thereby increasing our revenues, which will increase our expenses and lead to possible net losses. There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable.
