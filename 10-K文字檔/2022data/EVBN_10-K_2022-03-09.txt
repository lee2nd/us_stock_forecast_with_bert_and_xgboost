Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
This discussion is intended to compare the performance of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The review of the information presented should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1: “Business” and Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is a financial holding company registered under the BHCA. The Company currently conducts its business through its two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: the Bank, and the Bank’s subsidiaries, ENL and ENHC; and ENFS and its subsidiary, TEA. The Company does not engage in any other substantial business. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Company” refers collectively to Evans Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Impact of Covid-19
The Company's operations and financial results were substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021. Large portions of the U.S. economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and, as a result, many commercial and consumer customers were negatively affected. The most significant impacts to the Company’s financial results are reflected in the provision for loan loss and interest income.
‎
The Company recognized elevated levels of provisions for credit losses during 2020 that reflected projections of credit losses based on macroeconomic trends and conditions and an increase in criticized assets, primarily related to the identification of a well-defined weakness in the hotel industry which resulted in the classification of $81 million of loans to clients within that industry as criticized. The Company recorded provisions for credit losses of $5.4 million during 2020. An improvement in economic trends and conditions and a decrease in criticized assets during 2021 led the Company to recognize provision release of $1.5 million during 2021. Approximately one third of the hotel portfolio was upgraded, leaving approximately $50 million in criticized status at year end 2021.
In response to the pandemic, in 2020 the Federal Reserve took actions to lower interest rates that have negatively affected the Company’s net interest income since the beginning of the pandemic. The CARES Act and applicable extensions provide relief to borrowers, including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing, and also provided funding opportunities for small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) from approved Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lenders. PPP fees recognized in interest income were $8.8 million and $2.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Continuing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic include the duration of any outbreaks and any related variants, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, restrictions on individual and business activities, the impact to our customers, employees and vendors and the impact to the economy as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a significant impact on our business. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business.

Summary
Net income in 2021 was $24.0 million, a 114% increase from 2020 net income of $11.2 million. The increase in the Company’s net income during 2021 reflected higher net interest income of $13.0 million and the prior year’s $6.0 million in merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of FSB and $5.4 million provision for loan loss primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021 the Company released $1.5 million of the allowance for loan loss. Partially offsetting those benefits were increases of $5.6 million in salaries and employee benefits cost and $6.3 million of income tax provision. Net interest income was $72.8 million in 2021, a 22% increase from 2020, reflecting higher PPP fees of $5.9 million, $0.8 million in commercial prepayment fees, $0.5 million relating to the amortization of fair value marks on acquired loans, and the full year impact of the acquisition of FSB. Net interest margin was 3.57% and 3.37% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company’s release of the allowance for loan losses of $1.5 million, compared with the provision for loan loss of $5.4 million during 2020 reflects a decrease in non-performing and criticized loans as well as improvements in the economy related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.17% compared with 1.66% in 2020.
Non-interest income was $18.8 million and $18.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The largest component of the Company’s non-interest income, insurance service and fees, was $10.5 million in 2021, a decrease of $0.2 million or 1% from 2020. Deposit service charges were $2.5 million in 2021, an increase of $0.3 million from 2020. Included in the increase of non-interest income during 2021 were increases of $0.4 million in interchange fees, $0.4 million in loan fees, and $0.3 million in mortgage servicing rights income. During 2020 the Company recognized gains of $0.7 million relating to the sale of investment securities and $0.7 million relating to the sale of the previous administrative headquarters. Partially offsetting those 2020 gains was a $0.6 million loss on an investment in a historic rehabilitation tax credit. There were no significant gains or losses from the sale of assets or historic tax credit transactions during 2021.
Non-interest expense was $61.2 million, an increase of $1.4 million from 2020. Salaries and benefits expense, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased $5.6 million compared to 2020. Merger-related costs of $6.0 million were incurred during 2020, in connection with the acquisition of FSB. As a result of the full year impact of the FSB acquisition, occupancy expense and marketing expense increased $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in 2021 when compared with 2020.
Strategy
The Company’s goal is to continue to increase market share and achieve scale while improving profitability and returning value to shareholders. The Company’s biggest strength and earnings driver is commercial and small business lending. The Company expects to continue to focus on building on this competitive advantage by adding personnel in this area. Management has also bolstered its biggest driver of non-interest income, TEA, through both agency and talent acquisition as well as building out its employee benefits and financial services businesses. In addition, management intends to continue to develop strategies to deepen existing customer relationships with tailored product sets that reward the Company’s most loyal customers.
The Company’s strategies are designed to direct tactical investment decisions supporting its financial objectives. While the Company intends to focus its efforts on the pursuit of these strategies, there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement these strategies or that the strategies will produce the desired results. The Company’s most significant revenue source continues to be net interest income, defined as total interest income less interest expense. Net interest income accounted for 79% of total revenue in 2021. To produce net interest income and consistent earnings growth over the long-term, the Company must generate loan and deposit growth at acceptable margins within its market area. To generate and grow loans and deposits, the Company must focus on a number of areas including, but not limited to, sales practices, customer and employee satisfaction and retention, competition, evolving customer behavior, technology, product innovation, interest rates, credit performance of its customers and vendor relationships.
The Company also considers non-interest income important to its continued financial success. Fee income generation is partly related to the Company’s loan and deposit operations, such as deposit service charges, as well as to its financial products, such as commercial and personal insurance sold through TEA. Improved performance in non-interest income can help increase capital ratios because most of the non-interest income is generated without recording assets on the balance sheet. The Company has and will continue to face challenges in increasing its non-interest income as the regulatory environment changes.
The Company has focused its efforts on targeted groups in its community such as (1) smaller businesses with smaller credit needs but rich in deposits and other service needs; (2) middle market commercial businesses; (3) commercial real estate lending; (4) retail customers; and (5) municipal customers. The overarching goal is to cross-sell between our insurance, financial services and banking lines of business to deepen our relationships with all of our customers.
The Company strives to provide a personal touch to customer service and is committed to maintaining a local, community-based philosophy. The Bank has emphasized hiring local branch and lending personnel with strong ties to the specific local communities it serves.
The Bank serves its market through 21 banking offices in Western New York and the Finger Lakes Region of New York State. The Company’s principal source of funding is through deposits, which it reinvests in the community in the form of loans and investments. Deposits are insured up to the maximum permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Bank is regulated by the OCC.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and how those values are determined.
The more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the allowance for loan losses and valuation methodologies.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) represents management’s estimate of probable incurred losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment on the part of management and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, consideration of current economic trends and conditions, and other qualitative and quantitative factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Qualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts determined by historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others.
In estimating the ALLL on loans, management considers the sensitivity of the model and significant judgments and assumptions that could result in an amount that is materially different from management’s estimate. Given the concentration of ALLL allocation to the total commercial portfolio and the significant judgments made by management in deriving the qualitative loss factors, management analyzed the impact that changes in judgments could have. The range of impact on the ALLL allocated to the total commercial loan portfolio was between a reduction of $11.4 million and an increase of $9.7 million at December 31, 2021. The sensitivity and related range of impact is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management’s judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at December 31, 2021in estimation of the ALLL on loans recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
If the assumptions underlying the determination of the ALLL prove to be incorrect, the ALLL may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and an increase to the ALLL may be necessary to allow for different assumptions or adverse developments. In addition, a problem with one or more loans could require a significant increase to the ALLL.
Management’s methodology and policy in determining the allowance for loan losses can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The activity in the allowance for loan losses is depicted in supporting tables in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
‎
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND DECEMBER 31, 2020
Net Income
Net income of $24.0 million in 2021 consisted of $22.7 million related to the Company’s banking activities and $1.3 million related to the Company’s insurance agency activities. Net income of $24.0 million in 2021, or $4.37 per diluted share increased from $11.2 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, in 2020.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the difference between interest income and fee income on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on deposits and borrowings, provides the primary basis for the Company’s results of operations.
Net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities.
AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION
The following table presents the significant categories of the assets and liabilities of the Company, interest income and interest expense, and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid in 2021, 2020, and 2019. The assets and liabilities are presented as daily averages. The average loan balances include both performing and non-performing loans. Interest income on loans does not include interest on loans for which the Bank has ceased to accrue interest. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value. Interest and yield are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
‎
(1)Included in interest earned were PPP loans fees of $8.8 million and $2.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no PPP loan fees earned during 2019. Other loan fees included in interest earned were not material during 2021, 2020, and 2019.
The following table segregates changes in interest earned and paid for the past two years into amounts attributable to changes in volume and changes in rates by major categories of assets and liabilities. The change in interest income and expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated in the table to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. There are no out-of-period item adjustments included in the following table.
Net interest income increased by $13.0 million, or 22%, to $72.8 million in 2021 from $59.8 million in 2020. This change primarily resulted from increases of $5.9 million in PPP fees, $0.8 million in commercial prepayment fees, $0.5 million relating to the amortization of fair value marks on acquired loans, and the full year impact of the acquisition of FSB. In addition, interest expense decreased $4.3 million as the Company continued to align rates on deposits. Overall, the increased volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities positively impacted net interest income by $7.4 million in 2021, while the rates earned and paid on those respective assets and liabilities had a positive impact of $5.6 million.
The total commercial loan portfolio average balance, including commercial real estate and C&I loans, increased $31.0 million, or 3%, from a $1.17 billion average balance in 2020 to a $1.20 billion average balance in 2021. This increase was primarily the result of commercial real estate originations, partially offset by a decrease in commercial lines of credit. Average consumer loans, including residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, increased 27% from $375.2 million in 2020 to $476.2 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of FSB and higher levels of residential mortgage originations.
On the funding side, total average deposits increased $243.7 million, or 15%, year over year to $1.9 billion in 2021. The increase from the prior year reflects an accumulation of liquidity by commercial customers in response to the pandemic, including deposits related to PPP loans, and increases in consumer deposits from government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending.
The Company’s net interest margin increased from 3.37% in 2020 to 3.57% in 2021. The net interest spread, or the difference between yield on interest-earning assets and rate on interest-bearing liabilities, increased from 3.19% in 2020 to 3.48% in 2021. These changes are primarily attributable to the increase in PPP fees in 2021. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 7 basis points to 3.81% during 2021, reflecting the changes in the mix of interest-earning assets, including increased interest earning cash balances. Cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 36 basis points to 0.33% during 2021. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities is the result of lower rates as the Company continues to align rates on deposits. The rate paid on average time deposits decreased from 1.32% in 2020 to 0.53% in 2021. Average time deposits were 14% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2021, compared with 24% in the prior year period.
The Bank regularly monitors its exposure to interest rate risk. Management believes that the proper management of interest-sensitive funds will help protect the Bank’s earnings against changes in interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) meets monthly for the purpose of evaluating the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity position and the potential impact on capital and earnings of changes in interest rates. The Bank has adopted an asset/liability policy that specifies minimum limits for liquidity and capital ratios. This policy includes setting ranges for the negative impact acceptable on net interest income and on the fair value of equity as a
result of a shift in interest rates. The asset/liability policy also includes guidelines for investment activities and funds management. At its monthly meetings, ALCO reviews the Bank’s status and formulates its strategies based on current economic conditions, interest rate forecasts, loan demand, deposit volatility and the Bank’s earnings objectives.
Provision for Loan Losses
The Company’s release of allowance for loan losses of $1.5 million during 2021, compared with the provision for loan losses of $5.4 million in 2020 reflects a decrease in non-performing and criticized loans as well as improvements in economic trends and conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, the Company identified a well-defined weakness in the hotel industry and classified the $81 million of loans to clients within that industry as criticized. During 2021, approximately one third of the hotel portfolio was upgraded, leaving approximately $50 million in criticized status at year end. At December 31, 2021, criticized assets totaled $111 million, compared with $140 million in 2020. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.17% at December 31, 2021 compared with 1.66% at the end of 2020. The Company records a specific reserve on impaired loans and a higher reserve percentage on criticized loan balances, or those loans risk-rated special mention or worse, which are collectively evaluated for impairment. At December 31, 2021, criticized loans that were collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $97 million, compared with $116 million at December 31, 2020. Overall, total loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased $118 million to $1.6 billion at the end of 2021 from $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of a decrease in non-accrual loans that paid off or were individually evaluated for impairment during 2020.
A description of how the allowance for loan losses is determined along with tabular data depicting the key factors in calculating the allowance is set forth in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Non-accrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans
Non-performing loans decreased $9.7 million from $28.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $18.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in 2021 was primarily driven by three large non-accrual commercial real estate loans that paid off totaling $8.3 million and a $2.8 million commercial real estate loan that moved back to accruing status during 2021. Offsetting those decreases was approximately $5.0 million of commercial loans that moved to non-accrual status during 2021. Non-performing loans included $17.4 million of non-accruing loans at December 31, 2021 compared with $27.9 million at December 31, 2020. Total non-accrual loans to total loans was 1.11% and 1.65% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were $1.0 million of accruing loans categorized as 90 days past due at December 31, 2021 compared with $0.2 million at December 31, 2020.
Total non-performing loans to total assets was 0.83% at December 31, 2021 compared with 1.38% at December 31, 2020. Total non-performing loans to total loans and leases at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 1.17% and 1.66%, respectively.
The Company had $5.7 million in loans that were restructured and deemed to be TDRs at December 31, 2021 with $1.5 million of those balances in non-accrual status, compared with $7.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Any TDR that is placed on non-accrual is not returned to accruing status until the borrower makes timely payments as contracted for at least six months and future collection under the revised terms is probable. All of the restructurings were completed in an effort to maximize the Company’s ability to collect on loans where borrowers were experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications made to loans in a troubled debt restructuring did not have a material impact on the Company’s net income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The reserve for a TDR is based upon the present value of the future expected cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate or upon the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. This reserve methodology is used because all TDR loans are considered impaired. In accordance with the CARES Act and federal banking regulators issued guidance, modifications made to a borrower affected by the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a TDR classification if the loan was current were current as of December 31, 2019. This COVID-19 related TDR exception expired on January 1, 2022.
See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about the Company's non-accrual, past due and restructured loans.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The following table summarizes the Bank’s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type for years 2021 and 2020.
* includes construction loans
** includes other loans
During 2021, the Company had net loan charge-offs of $0.5 million, compared with of $0.1 million in 2020. The ratio of net loan charge-offs to average net loans outstanding was 0.03% in 2021 compared with 0.01% in 2020. There were no significant charge-offs or recoveries in 2021 or 2020. The following table presents by loan category net loan charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding ratios for 2021 and 2020.
* includes construction loans
** includes other loans
‎
Commercial mortgages comprised 67% of the allowance for loan losses, and correspondingly, the commercial mortgage portfolio made up the largest proportion, or 53%, of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, as compared with 65% of the allowance and 48% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. The commercial mortgage percentage of the allowance as it compares to the percentage of total loans primarily reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s hotel loan portfolio.
C&I loans comprised 18% of the allowance for loan losses and 15% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, as compared with 24% of the allowance and 25% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. These decreases primarily reflect a decrease in commercial lines of credit loans outstanding and the impact of SBA forgiveness of PPP loans during 2021.
Residential mortgages comprised 12% of the allowance for loan losses and 26% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, as compared with 8% of the allowance and 22% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. The change in the residential mortgage percentage of the allowance as it compares to the percentage of total loans primarily reflects an increase in residential mortgages originations during 2021. Loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value with no carry-over of an acquired entity’s previously established allowance for credit losses. Acquired residential mortgages that were not included in the allowance for loan losses were $120 million and $161 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In addition to acquired loans, PPP loans are excluded from the calculation of the allowance for loan losses because they are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. Total loans excluded from the calculation of the allowance for loan losses were $180 million and $397 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Overall, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased from 1.21% at December 31, 2020 to 1.17% on December 31, 2021. The decrease reflects improved economic trends and conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a sustained level of low charge-offs, and a decrease in non-performing loans. The non-performing loans to total loans ratio decreased from 1.66% at the end of 2020, to 1.17% at the conclusion of 2021.
The Company evaluates the loan portfolio to ensure that specific credits are appropriately graded and reserved. At least annually, borrowers’ financial information is reviewed by the individual relationship managers. Independent of the individual relationship managers, the credit department performs annual reviews on all requisite relationships within the loan portfolio. Additionally, the credit department, the loan review department monitors the management of the Company’s commercial loan portfolio. The Company’s loan review function reviews a percentage of the commercial loan portfolio based on an annual risk assessment, typically ranging from 35% to 50%. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is reflective of a fair assessment of the current environment and credit quality trends.
Non-Interest Income
Total non-interest income increased by $0.6 million from $18.2 million in 2020 to $18.8 million in 2021. Interchange fee income increased $0.4 million to $2.1 million at December 31, 2021. Deposit service charges were up $0.3 million to $2.5 million at December 31, 2021. During 2020, certain deposit service fees had been temporarily suspended to assist customers affected by COVID-19. During 2020, the Company recorded a $0.7 million gain on sale of investment securities and a $0.7 million gain on sale of the Company’s previous administrative headquarters, partially offset by a net loss of $0.6 million as a result of the recognition of a historic tax credit transaction. Insurance services fees of $10.5 million decreased $0.2 million compared to 2020. Insurance revenue remains the largest component of non-interest income at 55% of total non-interest income. TEA is a source of diversification in the earnings of the Company and helps generate income not directly impacted by difficult credit or interest rate environments.
The Company has been actively engaged in the community by financing historic rehabilitation projects in Buffalo and enhances its yield by investing in related tax credits. When a project is completed, the Company recognizes tax benefits with a related reduction in the investment. The impact on non-interest income from historic tax credit investments was a $0.6 million loss in 2020. There were no significant historic tax credit transactions in 2021.
Non-Interest Expense
Total non-interest expense increased $1.4 million, or 2%, from $59.9 million in 2020 to $61.2 million in 2021. The largest increases in non-interest expense in 2021 when compared with 2020 was salaries and employee benefits, which increased $5.6 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher incentive accruals and the full year impact of the FSB
acquisition. Occupancy expense increased $0.4 million and marketing expense increased $0.3 million also reflecting the addition of FSB. In addition, the Company had a $0.5 million increase in charitable contributions. Offsetting these increases were merger-related expenses of $6.0 million that were incurred during 2020 in connection with the acquisition of FSB. There were no merger-related expenses during 2021.
The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Company's GAAP efficiency ratio, or non-interest operating expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, was 66.8% in 2021 compared with 76.7% in 2020. The Company’s non-GAAP efficiency ratio, which excludes amortization expense, gains and losses from investment securities, merger-related expenses and the impact of historic tax credit transactions, was 66.2% in 2021 compared with 68.5% in 2020.
Taxes
Income tax expense for the year was $7.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.7% compared with an effective tax rate of 12.2% in 2020. Income tax expense in 2020 included a tax benefit relating to historic tax credit transactions. Excluding the impact of the historic tax credit transaction, the effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2020. There were no significant historic tax credit transactions in 2021. For further discussion of the Company’s income taxes, including a reconciliation from the statutory rate to the actual rate for 2021 and 2020, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The Company had total assets of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $167 million, or 8%, from $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Net loans of $1.6 billion at the most recent year end were $120 million, or 7%, lower than at December 31, 2020. Total investment securities increased $143 million, or 86%, from $167 million at December 31, 2020 to $309 million at December 31, 2021, and deposits increased by $166 million, or 9%, to $1.9 billion as of the end of 2021. Stockholders’ equity was $184 million at the conclusion of 2021, a $15 million, or 9% increase from $169 million at the previous year end.
Securities Activities
The primary objectives of the Bank’s securities portfolio are to provide liquidity and maximize income while preserving safety of principal. Secondary objectives include: providing collateral to secure local municipal deposits, the investment of funds during periods of decreased loan demand, interest rate sensitivity considerations, supporting local communities through the purchase of tax-exempt securities and tax planning considerations. The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing overall policy and reviewing performance of the Bank’s investments.
Under the Bank’s policy, acceptable portfolio investments include: United States Government obligations, obligations of federal agencies or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, municipal obligations (general obligations, revenue obligations, school districts and non-rated issues from the Bank’s general market area), banker’s acceptances, certificates of deposit, Industrial Development Authority Bonds, Public Housing Authority Bonds, corporate bonds (each corporation limited to the Bank’s legal lending limit), collateralized mortgage obligations, Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC), Federal Reserve stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.
In regard to municipal securities, the Company’s general investment policy is that in-state securities must be rated at least Moody’s Baa (or equivalent) at the time of purchase. The Company reviews the ratings report and municipality financial statements and prepares a pre-purchase analysis report before the purchase of any municipal securities. Out-of-state issues must be rated by Moody’s at least Aa (or equivalent) at the time of purchase. The Company did not own any out-of-state municipal bonds at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. Bonds rated below A are reviewed periodically to ensure their continued creditworthiness. While purchase of non-rated municipal securities is permitted, such purchases are limited to bonds issued by municipalities in the Company’s general market area. Those municipalities are typically customers of the Bank whose financial situation is familiar to management. The financial statements of the issuers of non-rated securities are reviewed by the Bank and a credit file of the issuers is kept on each non-rated municipal security with relevant financial information.
The Company has not experienced any credit troubles in its municipal bond portfolio and does not believe any credit troubles are imminent. Aside from the non-rated municipal securities to local municipalities discussed above that are considered held-to-maturity, all of the Company’s available-for-sale municipal bonds are investment-grade
government obligation (“G.O.”) bonds. G.O. bonds are generally considered safer than revenue bonds because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government while revenue bonds rely on the revenue produced by a particular project. All of the Company’s municipal bonds are to municipalities in New York State. To the Company’s knowledge, there has never been a default on a NY G.O. bond in the history of the state. The Company believes that its risk of loss on default of a G.O. municipal bond for the Company is relatively low. However, historical performance does not guarantee future performance.
All fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools backing the Company’s mortgage-backed securities contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment rates. The Company uses a third-party developed model to monitor the average life and yield volatility of mortgage pools under various interest rate assumptions.
The Company designates all securities at the time of purchase as either “held to maturity” or “available for sale.” Securities designated as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost and consist of municipal investments that the Bank has made in its local market area. At December 31, 2021, $3.2 million in securities were designated as held to maturity. Debt and mortgage backed securities designated as available for sale are reported at fair market value.
Fair values for available for sale securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Company utilizes a third-party for these pricing services. The third-party utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the third-party service provider’s evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. In addition, our third-party pricing service provider uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. The models and the process take into account market convention. For each asset class, a team of evaluators gathers information from market sources and integrates relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news into the evaluated pricing applications and models. The third party, at times, may determine that it does not have sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security. In these cases the Company will utilize valuations from another pricing service.
Management believes that it has a sufficient understanding of the third party service’s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control. On a quarterly basis the Company reviews changes, as submitted by our third-party pricing service provider, in the market value of its securities portfolio. Individual changes in valuations are reviewed for consistency with general interest rate movements and any known credit concerns for specific securities. Additionally, on a quarterly basis the Company has its entire securities portfolio priced by a second pricing service to determine consistency with another market evaluator. If, on the Company’s review or in comparing with another servicer, a material difference between pricing evaluations were to exist, the Company may submit an inquiry to our third party pricing service provider regarding the data used to value a particular security. If the Company determines it has market information that would support a different valuation than our third-party pricing service provider’s evaluation it can submit a challenge for a change to that security’s valuation. There were no material differences in valuations noted in 2021 or 2020.
The available for sale portfolio totaled $306 million or approximately 99% of the Company’s securities portfolio at December 31, 2021. Net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities resulted in an unrealized loss of $4.3 million at December 31, 2021, as compared with a net unrealized gain of $3.2 million at December 31, 2020. The change in the net unrealized position of the portfolio in 2021 was due to the increase in market interest rates during the year and the increase in total securities resulting from elevated purchase activity. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported, net of taxes, as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the impact of net unrealized losses, net of taxes, on stockholders’ equity was $5.6 million.
Certain securities available for sale were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021. Management assessed those securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021 and determined the decline in fair value below amortized cost to be temporary. In making this determination, management considered the period of time the securities were in a loss position, the percentage decline in comparison to the securities’ amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer (primarily government or government-sponsored enterprises) and the Company’s ability and intent to hold these securities until their fair value recovers to their amortized cost. Management believes
the decline in fair value is primarily related to market interest rate fluctuations and not to the credit deterioration of the individual issuer.
Securities and interest-bearing deposits at banks made up 19% of the Company’s total average interest-earning assets in 2021 compared with 14% in 2020. The Company’s securities portfolio outstanding balances increased from $167 million at December 31, 2020 to $309 million at December 31, 2021 and the Company’s interest-bearing deposits at banks increased from $84 million to $235 million over the same time period. The interest-bearing deposits are liquid interest-bearing cash accounts at correspondent banks. The increase in interest-bearing deposits reflective of excess liquidity due to growth in funding from customer deposits. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s concentration in U.S. government-sponsored agency bonds was 31% of the total securities balance versus 41% at December 31, 2020. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities comprised 66% of the portfolio at December 31, 2021, compared with 52% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020, and tax-advantaged municipal bonds made up 3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2021 versus 7% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020.
Income from securities held in the Bank’s investment portfolio represented 6% of total interest income of the Company in 2021 and 2020. Taxable securities yields declined to 1.90% in 2021 from 2.35% in 2020, while tax-exempt yields were 2.04% in 2021 and 2.36% in 2020. Returns weakened in 2021 as market interest rates remained low. The tax-exempt portfolio has significantly declined since 2017 as the decrease in the Company’s federal tax rate has reduced the effectiveness of municipal bonds.
As a member of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, the Bank is required to hold stock in those entities. The Bank held $3.0 million and $3.5 million in FHLB stock as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $3.0 million and $2.3 million in FRB stock at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Available for sale securities with a total fair value of $207 million at December 31, 2021 were pledged as collateral to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
‎
The following table sets forth the contractual maturities and weighted average interest yields of the Bank’s securities portfolio that are not carried at fair value through earnings (yields on tax-exempt obligations are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis) as of December 31, 2021. Expected maturities will differ from contracted maturities since issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without penalties.
LENDING ACTIVITIES
The Bank has a loan policy which is approved by its Board of Directors on an annual basis. The loan policy governs the conditions under which loans may be made, addresses the lending authority of Bank officers, documentation requirements, appraisal policy, charge-off policies and desired portfolio mix. The Bank’s lending limit to any one borrower is subject to regulation by the OCC. The Bank continually monitors its loan portfolio to review compliance with new and existing regulations.
The Bank offers a variety of loan products to its customers, including residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial loans, and installment loans. The Bank primarily extends loans to customers located within the Company’s footprint. Interest income on loans represented 94% of the total interest income of the Company in 2021 and 2020. The Bank’s loan portfolio, net of the allowances for loan losses, totaled $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The net loan portfolio represented 81% and 86% of the Company’s average interest-earning assets during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
‎
The following table summarizes the major classifications of the Bank’s loans as of the dates indicated:
Real Estate Loans
Approximately 85% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 consisted of real estate loans or loans collateralized by mortgages on real estate, including residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other types of real estate loans. The Bank’s real estate loan portfolio was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.27 billion at December 31, 2020. The real estate loan portfolio increased by 5% in 2021 over 2020, primarily as a result of higher residential mortgage real estate loans.
The Bank offers fixed rate residential mortgage loans with terms of 10 to 30 years with, typically, up to an 80% loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio. Fixed rate residential mortgage loans outstanding totaled $400 million at December 31, 2021 compared with $348 million at December 31, 2020, which was 25% and 21% of total loans outstanding, respectively. This balance did not include any construction residential mortgage loans, which are discussed below. Residential mortgage originations in 2021 were $121 million compared with $107 million in 2020. The increase was primarily the result of customers refinancing as they were able to benefit from low interest rates.
The Bank has a contractual arrangement with FNMA, pursuant to which the Bank sells certain mortgage loans to FNMA and the Bank retains the servicing rights to those loans. The Bank determines with each origination of residential real estate loans which desired maturities, within the context of overall maturities in the loan portfolio, provide the appropriate mix to optimize the Bank’s ability to absorb the corresponding interest rate risk within the Company’s tolerance ranges. In 2021, the Bank sold $1 million in mortgages to FNMA under this arrangement, compared with $15 million in mortgages sold in 2020.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $70 million in unpaid principal balances of loans that it services for FHLMC, compared with $95 million at December 31, 2020. No loans were sold to FHLMC by the Company during the years 2021 and 2020.
At December 31, 2021, the Bank had retained the servicing rights on $61 million in mortgages sold to FNMA, compared with a $77 million servicing portfolio of loans sold to FNMA at December 31, 2020. The Company recorded a net servicing asset for such loans of $0.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
‎
The Bank offers adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. Rates on these mortgage loans remain fixed for a predetermined time and are adjusted annually thereafter. The Bank’s outstanding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans were $11 million at December 31, 2021 compared with $16 million at December 31, 2020. At each respective time period adjustable rate residential mortgage loans represented less than 1% of total loans outstanding. With rates on fixed rate mortgage products at still near historic lows, there has been little demand for variable-rate products which has resulted in minimal growth in variable rate mortgage loan balances.
Overall, residential real estate loans increased from $365 million at December 31, 2020 to $411 million at December 31, 2021.
The Bank also offers commercial mortgage loans with up to an 80% LTV ratio for up to 20 years on a variable and fixed rate basis. Many of these mortgage loans either mature or are subject to a rate call after three to five years. To the extent required, loans exceeding an 80% LTV are reported on an exception report to the Board of Directors. The Bank’s outstanding commercial mortgage loans were $740 million at December 31, 2021, which was 47% of total loans outstanding, and 5% higher than the $706 million balance at December 31, 2020. The balance at December 31, 2021 included $663 million in fixed rate and $77 million in variable rate commercial mortgage loans, which include interest rate calls.
The Bank also offers other types of loans collateralized by real estate, such as home equity loans. The Bank offers home equity loans at variable and fixed interest rates with terms of up to 15 years and up to an 85% combined LTV ratio. At December 31, 2021, the real estate loan portfolio included $81 million of home equity loans, which represented 5% of total loans outstanding, compared with $83 million and 5% at December 31, 2020, respectively. The total home equity portfolio included $75 million in variable rate loans and $6 million in fixed rate loans.
The Bank also offers both residential and commercial real estate construction loans at up to an 80% LTV ratio at fixed interest or adjustable interest rates and multiple maturities. At December 31, 2021, adjustable rate construction loans outstanding totaled $84 million, or 5% of total loans outstanding, and fixed rate real estate construction loans outstanding totaled $19 million, or 1% of total loans outstanding. At December 31, 2020, adjustable rate construction loans outstanding totaled $73 million, or 4% of total loans outstanding, and fixed rate real estate construction loans outstanding totaled $41 million, or 2% of total loans outstanding.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
The Bank offers C&I loans on a secured and unsecured basis, including lines of credit and term loans at fixed and variable interest rates and multiple maturities. The Bank’s C&I loan portfolio totaled $237 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $430 million at December 31, 2020, a 45% decrease. The decrease is attributable to the SBA forgiveness of PPP loans during 2021. At December 31, 2021 there was $25 million in PPP loans outstanding compared to $187 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 commercial lines of credit were reduced by $34 million since the end of 2020. Loan growth was muted due to economic factors, including the contraction in economic activity resulting from the pandemic and the reduced demand resulting from the availability of PPP loans. C&I loans represented 15% of the Bank’s total loans at the end of 2021 and 25% at the end of 2020.
Collateral for C&I loans, where applicable, may consist of inventory, receivables, equipment and other business assets. At December 31, 2021, 6% of the Bank’s C&I loans were at variable rates which are tied to the prime rate or LIBOR.
‎
Consumer Loans
The Bank’s consumer installment and other loan portfolio totaled $0.7 million at December 31, 2021 compared with $0.2 million at December 31, 2020, representing less than 1% of the Bank’s total loans outstanding at those dates. Traditional installment loans are offered at fixed interest rates with various maturities of up to 60 months, on a secured and unsecured basis. This segment of the portfolio is done on an accommodation basis for customers. The Company does not actively try to grow the portfolio in a significant way. Other loans consisted primarily of cash reserves, overdrafts, and loan clearing accounts.
Loan Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates
The following table shows the maturities of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and the classification of those loans according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
*Includes commercial real estate construction loans
**Includes residential real estate construction loans
‎
SOURCES OF FUNDS
General
Customer deposits represent the primary source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, other sources of funds include loan repayments, loan sales on the secondary market, interest and dividend income from investments, matured investments, borrowings from the FHLB and from correspondent banks, and issuance of securities.
Deposits
The Bank offers a variety of deposit products, including checking, savings, NOW accounts, certificates of deposit and jumbo certificates of deposit. Bank deposits are insured up to the limits provided by the FDIC.
As of December 31, 2021 the amount of total uninsured deposits, deposits that exceed the limits provided by the FDIC, was $ 0.7 billion.
The following schedule indicates the amount of time deposits in uninsured accounts by time remaining until maturity at December 31, 2021:
Total deposits at December 31, 2021 increased $166 million or 9% from the end of 2020. The increase from the prior year reflects an accumulation of liquidity by commercial customers in response to the pandemic, including deposits related to PPP loans, and increases in consumer deposits from government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending.
Included in the increase were total savings of $194 million, and non-interest bearing demand deposits and NOW deposits of $86 million, reflecting deposits related to PPP loans and lower consumer spending. Partially offsetting the increase, total time deposits decreased $114 million from prior year. Economic factors, such as low interest rates, played a role in the changes in deposit mix from prior year.
As of December 31, 2021, savings deposits increased $194 million, or 23%, over the previous year end. The growth in savings deposits was attributable to $105 million in commercial savings deposits, $59 million increase in consumer savings, and $30 million in municipal savings deposits.
Time deposits were $164 million as of December 31, 2021, a $114 million or 41% decrease from December 31, 2020. The Company took a less aggressive stance during 2021 in rates for time deposits as liquidity was higher due to commercial customers response to the pandemic. Consumer time deposits decreased $106 million or 41% from previous year end. Brokered time deposits, included in other time deposits in the tables above, provide an additional funding source for loan growth. Brokered time deposits decreased $8 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021.
‎
Federal Funds Purchased and Other Borrowed Funds
Another source of the Bank’s funds for lending and investing activities is borrowings from the FHLB. The Bank had no outstanding balance on its overnight line of credit with the FHLB as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company’s use of its overnight line of credit with FHLBNY varies depending on its ability to fund investment and loan growth with deposits along with the line usage’s impact on interest rate risk. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had $33 million in FHLB borrowings compared with $44 million at December 31, 2020. The FHLB borrowings as of December 31, 2021 have various maturity dates through 2024 and a weighted average rate of 2.64%.
Subordinated Debt
On October 1, 2004, Evans Capital Trust I, a statutory business trust wholly-owned by the Company (the “Trust”), issued $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of floating rate preferred capital securities due November 23, 2034 to investors (the “Capital Securities”) and $0.3 million of common securities to the Company (the “Common Securities”). The Capital Securities represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust. The Common Securities are wholly-owned by the Company and are the only class of the Trust’s securities possessing general voting powers. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities, the Company issued an $11.3 million floating rate junior subordinated debt security, due October 1, 2037, to the Trust. Payments from the Company under the junior subordinated debt security are the sole source of cash flow for the Trust and fund the Trust’s payments on its Capital Securities. The interest rate payable to holders of the Capital Securities was 2.86% at December 31, 2021.
On July 9, 2020, the Company issued and sold $20 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2030.
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
The Bank enters into agreements with certain customers to sell securities owned by the Bank to those customers and repurchase the identical security within one day. No physical movement of the securities is involved. The customer is informed that the securities are held in safekeeping by the Bank on behalf of the customer. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $4.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Balances can vary day to day based on customer needs.
Liquidity
The Company utilizes cash flows from its investment portfolio and federal funds sold balances to manage the liquidity requirements it experiences due to loan demand and deposit fluctuations. The Bank also has many borrowing options. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is able to borrow funds at competitive rates. Given the current collateral available, advances of up to $391 million can be drawn on the FHLB via the Bank’s Overnight Line of Credit Agreement. The Bank also has the ability to purchase up to $18 million in federal funds from its correspondent banks. By placing sufficient collateral in safekeeping at the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank could also borrow at the FRB’s discount window. The Company’s liquidity needs also can be met by more aggressively pursuing time deposits, accessing the brokered time deposit market, including the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) network. Additionally, the Company has access to capital markets as a funding source.
The cash flows from the Company’s investment portfolio are laddered, so that securities mature at regular intervals, to provide funds from principal and interest payments at various times as liquidity needs may arise. Contractual maturities are also laddered, with consideration as to the volatility of market prices, so that securities are available for sale from time-to-time without the need to incur significant losses. At December 31, 2021, approximately 1% of the Company’s debt securities had maturity dates of one year or less, and approximately 6% had maturity dates of five years or less. In addition, the Company receives regular cash flows on its mortgage-backed securities.
The Company, on an ongoing basis, closely monitors the Company’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies, and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. As part of that monitoring process, management calculates the 90-day liquidity each month by analyzing the cash needs of the Bank. Included in the calculation are liquid assets and potential liabilities. The Company stresses the potential liabilities calculation to ensure a strong liquidity position. Included in the calculation are assumptions of some significant deposit run-off as well as funds needed for loan closing and investment purchases. At December 31, 2021, in the stress test, the Bank had net short-term liquidity available of $724 million as compared with $410 million
at December 31, 2020. Available assets of $546 million divided by public and purchased funds of $356 million resulted in a long-term liquidity ratio of 153% at December 31, 2021, compared with 70% at December 31, 2020.
The Company does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or over the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and which would therefore result in significant pressure on liquidity. However, an economic recession could negatively impact the Company’s liquidity. The Bank relies heavily on FHLBNY as a source of funds, particularly with its overnight line of credit. In past economic recessions, some FHLB branches have suspended dividends, cut dividend payments, and not bought back excess FHLB stock that members hold in an effort to conserve capital. FHLBNY has stated that it expects to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future. The 11 FHLB branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system’s debt, other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment.
Systemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks.
Contractual Obligations
The Company is party to contractual financial obligations, including repayment of borrowings, operating lease payments, commitments to extend credit, and purchase agreements.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had commitments to extend credit of $395 million, compared with $359 million at December 31, 2020. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, this disclosure should be read in conjunction with Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Capital
Total Company stockholders’ equity was $184 million at December 31, 2021, an increase from $169 million at December 31, 2020. Equity as a percentage of assets was 8.3% at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Book value per share of common stock increased to $33.54 at December 31, 2021 from $31.21 at December 31, 2020. The increase in stockholders’ equity and book value per share was primarily the result of $24 million in net income, offset in part by $5.6 million unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities, and $6.5 million in dividends paid to common stockholders in 2021.
The aggregate dividend payment of $1.20 per share in 2021 was $0.04, or 3% higher per share than dividends paid in 2020. The Company typically pays a semi-annual dividend in April and October of each year. Management and the Board of Directors of the Company believe that the dividend level is prudent to maintain available capital to support the continued growth of the Company, as well as to manage the Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios, while providing a dividend yield (dividend per share divided by stock price) competitive with peers in the industry at an annualized rate of 2.98% at December 31, 2021.
Included in stockholders’ equity is accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale. Net unrealized losses after tax were $3.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared with net unrealized gains of $2.4 million at December 31, 2020. Such unrealized gains and losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available-for-sale. The Company had no other-than-temporary impairment charges in its investment portfolio in 2021 or 2020.
The Company and the Bank have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above well capitalized standards. For further detail on capital and capital ratios, see Note 21 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates of the Bank’s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking activities of
lending and deposit-taking expose the Bank to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities re-price at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Bank is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Bank measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in the future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management’s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique described above with the analysis of market values of the Bank’s financial instruments and changes to such market values given changes in interest rates.
ALCO, which includes members of the Bank’s senior management, monitors the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as the interrelationships between the magnitude and timing of the re-pricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, the Bank’s management has taken actions and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate the Bank's exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off-balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the purchase of other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. In 2021 and 2020, the Bank did not use off-balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES
Many assumptions are utilized by the Bank to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions relate to the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Bank also assumes immediate changes in rates, including 100 and 200 basis point rate changes. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts, such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Bank cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/re-pricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. At each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bank's projected net interest income benefitted more from a 100 basis point increase in market rates compared with a 200 basis point increase in rates. This relationship was due in part to expected increases in deposit rates needed to retain deposit customers if rates moved up 200 basis points but were not required if rates only moved 100 basis points higher. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table, and changes in such amounts, are not considered significant to the Bank’s projected net interest income
Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at December 31, 2021 included $360 million in undisbursed lines of credit at an average interest rate of 3.18%; $9 million in fixed rate loan origination commitments at 2.74%; and $4 million in adjustable rate letters of credit, which if drawn upon, would typically earn an interest rate equal to the prime lending rate plus 2%. Unused overdraft protection lines totaled $22 million.
The following table represents expected maturities of interest-bearing assets and liabilities and their corresponding average interest rates.
The amounts in the above table exclude acquisition fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs.
When rates rise or fall, the market value of the Company’s rate-sensitive assets and liabilities increases or decreases. As a part of the Company’s asset/liability policy, the Company has set limitations on the acceptable level of the negative impact of such rate fluctuations on the market value of the Company’s balance sheet. On a quarterly basis, the balance sheet is shocked for immediate rate movement of 200 basis points. At December 31, 2021, the Company determined it would take an immediate movement in rates in excess of 200 basis points to eliminate the current capital cushion in excess of regulatory requirements. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios are also reviewed by management on a quarterly basis.
Capital Expenditures
Significant planned expenditures for 2022 include the purchase of technology to improve workflow automation and operational efficiency. The Company believes it has a sufficient capital base to support these known and potential capital expenditures, currently expected to total approximately $1.2 million, with current assets.
‎
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
There will continually be economic events, such as changes in the economic policies of the FRB, which will have an impact on the profitability of the Company. Inflation may result in impaired asset growth, reduced earnings and substandard capital ratios. The net interest margin can be adversely impacted by the volatility of interest rates throughout the year. Since these factors are unknown, management attempts to structure the balance sheet and re-pricing frequency of assets and liabilities to avoid a significant concentration that could result in a negative impact on earnings.
Segment Information
The Company’s operating segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting. The Company’s operating segments consist of banking activities and insurance agency activities.
The banking activities segment includes all of the activities of the Bank in its function as a full-service commercial bank. Net income from banking activities was $22.7 million in 2021 compared with $10.1 million in 2020. The increase in net income from banking activities was driven by higher net interest income of $13.0 million largely from an increase in PPP fees of $5.9 million and the full year impact of the 2020 acquisition of FSB. Net interest income, increased 22% from $59.8 million in 2020 to $72.8 million in 2021. The prior year also included a $5.4 million provision for loan loss compared with a release of allowance for loan loss of $1.5 million in 2021. Non-interest expense increased $1.5 million to $52.8 million in 2021 primarily due to increased incentive expenses and the full year impact of the 2020 FSB acquisition, partially offset by $6.0 million of merger-related expenses incurred during 2020. There were no merger-related expenses during 2021. Total assets of the banking activities segment were $2.2 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $167 million or 8.2% from December 31, 2020. The year over year increase in total assets is primarily a result of PPP loans and the FSB acquisition.
The insurance activities segment includes activities of TEA, a property and casualty insurance agency with locations in the Western New York area. Net income from insurance activities was $1.3 million in 2021, an increase from $1.2 million in 2020. TEA’s total assets were $18.3 million at December 31, 2021 and $18.6 million at December 31, 2020.
