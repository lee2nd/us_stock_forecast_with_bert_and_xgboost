Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Report. This discussion includes both historical information and forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in the sections titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Report.
Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Surrozen,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Surrozen Operating, Inc., or Legacy Surrozen, prior to its Business Combination with Consonance-HFW Acquisition Corp. and Surrozen, Inc., formerly known as Consonance-HFW Acquisition Corp., together with its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Business Combination.
Overview
We are discovering and developing biologic drug candidates to selectively modulate the Wnt pathway, a critical mediator of tissue repair, in a broad range of organs and tissues. Building upon the seminal work of our founders and scientific advisors who discovered the Wnt gene and key regulators of the Wnt pathway, we have made breakthrough discoveries that we believe will overcome previous limitations in harnessing the potential of Wnt biology. These breakthroughs enable us to rapidly and flexibly design tissue-targeted therapeutics that modulate Wnt signaling. As a result of our discoveries, we are pioneering the selective activation of Wnt signaling, designing and engineering Wnt pathway mimetics, and advancing tissue-specific Wnt candidates. Our lead product candidates are multi-specific, antibody-based therapeutics that mimic the roles of naturally occurring Wnt or R-spondin proteins, which are involved in activation and enhancement of the Wnt pathway, respectively. Given Wnt signaling is essential in tissue maintenance and regeneration throughout the body, we have the potential to target a wide variety of severe diseases, including certain diseases that afflict the intestine, liver, retina, cornea, lung, kidney, cochlea, skin, pancreas and central nervous system. In each of these areas, we believe our approach has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for the disease and substantially impact patient outcomes. Our strategy is to exploit the full potential of Wnt signaling by identifying disease states responsive to Wnt modulation, design tissue-specific therapeutics, and advance candidates into clinical development in targeted indications with high unmet need. Our unique approach and platform technologies have led to the discovery and advancement of two lead product candidates. We are currently conducting preclinical studies and plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2022 for SZN-1326, our candidate in development for moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, with ulcerative colitis, or UC, as our first proposed indication. Furthermore, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2022 for SZN-043, our candidate in development for severe alcoholic hepatitis, or AH. We expect to nominate additional lead candidates and advance them into the clinic in 2023 and beyond. In January 2022, we nominated SZN-413, as a development candidate for the treatment of retinal vascular -associated diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy.
The chart below represents a summary of our wholly owned product candidates:
By leveraging our scientific capabilities and approach, we have identified more than 20 potential tissue types to explore. In our most advanced research programs, we are developing potential therapeutics for ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and diabetic retinopathy. Genetic studies in the literature have identified that the Wnt signaling pathway is critical for maintenance of healthy retinal blood vessels. We have shown that activation of Wnt-pathway signaling can potentially reverse vascular damage through a mechanism that is distinct from the mechanisms of currently approved therapeutics that target angiogenesis. We also have identified the potential for regeneration of retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, an important cell type in the retina. RPE cells are required for maintenance and viability of photoreceptors and as such are a potential target for the treatment of dry AMD. We are also assessing the potential to drive tissue repair in conditions such as hearing loss and diseases resulting in tissue injury to organs including the cornea, lacrimal gland, lung and kidney. The chart below represents a summary of our research programs:
Since our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing and optimizing our Wnt therapeutics platform, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking research and development activities, engaging in strategic transactions, establishing and enhancing our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on the successful development of any future product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years.
Business Combination
On August 11, 2021, we consummated a business combination, or the Business Combination, pursuant to the business combination agreement, or the Business Combination Agreement, entered into on April 15, 2021 among Consonance-HFW Acquisition Corp., or Consonance, Perseverance Merger Sub Inc., a subsidiary of Consonance, or Merger Sub, and Surrozen, Inc., or Legacy Surrozen, a Delaware company incorporated on August 12, 2015. Upon closing of the Business Combination, Consonance became a Delaware corporation and was renamed to Surrozen, Inc., Legacy Surrozen was renamed to Surrozen Operating, Inc., and Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Surrozen, with Legacy Surrozen as the surviving company and, after giving effect to such merger, continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Surrozen. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization with Legacy Surrozen as the accounting acquirer and Consonance as the acquired company for accounting purposes. All historical financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements prior to the closing of the Business Combination represents the accounts of Legacy Surrozen at their historical cost as if Legacy Surrozen is the predecessor. The consolidated financial statements following the closing of the Business Combination reflect the results of the combined entity’s operations.
Immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination, certain investors subscribed for and purchased an aggregate of 12,020,000 units for a purchase price of $10.00 per unit through a private investment in public entity financing, or PIPE Financing. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant for one share of the common stock. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination and PIPE Financing, we received cash consideration of $128.8 million, after deducting the transaction fees incurred by Consonance.
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, upon the closing of the Business Combination, (i) each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock of Legacy Surrozen (on an as converted to common stock basis) and each share of common stock of Legacy Surrozen, whether vested or unvested, was converted into 0.175648535 shares of the Company’s common stock and (ii) each outstanding option to purchase common stock of Legacy Surrozen was converted into an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.175648535, or the Exchange Ratio, with corresponding adjustments to the exercise price. All issued and outstanding common stock, preferred stock and stock awards of Legacy Surrozen and corresponding capital amounts contained in this Report for the periods presented prior to the closing of the Business Combination have been retroactively restated to reflect the conversion.
Key Trends, Opportunities and Uncertainties Affecting Results of Operations
Prior to the Business Combination, we financed our operations primarily with $133.1 million in net cash proceeds from private placements of Legacy Surrozen’s redeemable convertible preferred stock. We have incurred net losses in each year since inception.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $54.6 million and $32.7 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we used $48.8 million and $29.1 million of cash in operations, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $142.6 million. We do not expect positive cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $123.5 million. We estimate, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Report. We have based this projection on assumptions that may be inaccurate and as a result, we may utilize our capital resources sooner than we expect.
We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and expect to incur increased expenses as we expand our pipeline and advance our product candidates through clinical development and regulatory submissions. Specifically, in the near term we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our planned Phase 1 clinical trials, the development and validation of our manufacturing processes, and other research and development activities.
We will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our development strategy. Until such time as we can generate sufficient revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including government grants, potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. In February 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park, pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time over a 36-month period, subject to certain conditions and limitations. There is no assurance that we will be able to receive any or all of the funds from Lincoln Park because of the limitations, restrictions, requirements, events of default and other provisions contained in the purchase agreement that could limit our ability to cause Lincoln Park to purchase our common stock. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States, and worldwide resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development of our product pipeline or other research and development initiatives. We also could be required to seek collaborators for our product pipeline and any future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product pipeline and any future product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.
The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including the pace and results of our development efforts. We cannot assure that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtains marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture, package, label, store, and distribute our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, our products. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment, and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our products.
The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor developments closely. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 on our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our preclinical development activities, planning for regulatory submissions and clinical trials, clinical research organizations, or CROs, third-party manufacturers, other third parties with whom we do business, and, if we obtain regulatory approval to commence dosing in humans, trial enrollment and trial sites.
In addition, the pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications to employee travel and many of our employees working flexible schedules. We will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to COVID-19 and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. At this point, the extent to which
the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans, including the resulting impact on our expenditures and capital needs, remains uncertain.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products, and we do not expect to generate any revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory clearance or approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates.
Operating Expenses
We classify operating expenses into two main categories: (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses.
Research and Development Expenses
Since our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities. Our research and development expenses consist of external and internal expenses incurred in connection with our research activities and development programs.
External expenses include:
•costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs and other third parties conducting research and development activities on our behalf;
•costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing drug candidate materials; and
•license payments under our license agreements made for intellectual property used in research and development activities.
Internal expenses include:
•personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for individuals involved in our research and product development activities; and
•facilities, depreciation, and other allocated costs, which include rent and insurance.
We expect our research and development expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we identify and develop product candidates, in particular as we seek to initiate clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval and commercialization for SZN-1326 and SZN-043.
Research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as an expense as the related services are performed. We recognize the funds from government grants as a reduction of research and development expenses when the related research costs are incurred. We track external expenses by stage of program, clinical or preclinical. However, we do not track internal expenses on a program specific or stage of program basis because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified.
We have entered, and may continue to enter, into license agreements to access and utilize certain molecules. We evaluate if the license agreement is an acquisition of an asset or a business. To date, none of our license agreements have been considered to be an acquisition of a business. For asset acquisitions, the upfront payments to acquire such licenses, as well as any future milestone payments made before product approval, are immediately recognized as research and development expenses when due, provided there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of SZN-1326 and SZN-043 or any future product candidates. This is due to
the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates, many of which are outside of our control, including those associated with:
•the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;
•the number of sites and patients included in the clinical trials;
•the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted;
•per patient trial costs;
•successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation of, clinical trials, as well as drop out or discontinuation rates, particularly in light of the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•the number of trials required for regulatory approval;
•the timing, receipt and terms of any regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•the performance of our future collaborators, if any;
•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;
•the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic environment;
•launching commercial sales of our drug candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•the effect of products that may compete with our product candidates or other market developments; and
•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the drug candidates following approval.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our drug candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, human resources, business and corporate development, legal, and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees, professional fees paid for accounting, auditing, consulting, tax, investor relations services, insurance costs, and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, and costs associated with compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of the Nasdaq listing rules.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we expand our operating activities and prepare for clinical trials of our product candidates, increase our headcount and support our operations as a public company and our growth, including increased expenses related to legal, accounting, insurance, regulatory and tax-related services associated with
maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, directors and officers liability insurance premiums and investor relations activities.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Other Expense, Net
Other expense, net consists of the gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities and the transaction costs allocated to the warrant liabilities assumed in the Business Combination.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands):
* Percentage is not meaningful
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):
(1)In future periods when clinical trial expenses are incurred, external expenses will be broken out between our clinical programs and preclinical programs.
The increase of $14.5 million, or 56%, in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is due in part to the $9.8 million increase in external expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to SZN-1326 and SZN-043, the $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, as a result of a higher headcount to support continued investment in our product candidates and the increase of $1.4 million in the facility-related costs and other expenses is attributable to the increase in rent and corporate insurance.
General and Administrative Expenses
The increase of $7.1 million, or 100%, in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily attributable to the $3.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including $1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, due to an increase in headcount, the $3.1 million increase in professional service fees and consulting services to support the growth of our operations, the $0.4 million increase in facility-related costs and other expenses
including rent and corporate insurance and the increase of $0.2 million in information technology costs to support our growth and operations as a public company.
Interest Income
The decrease of $19,000 in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is due to the decrease in interest rates on our money market funds and marketable securities.
Other Expense, Net
The increase of $0.3 million in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is related to the transaction costs of $0.4 million incurred in connection with the Business Combination which were allocated to the warrant liabilities assumed, offset by the gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $0.1 million, subsequent to the Business Combination.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have historically financed our operations primarily through private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock. In connection with the Business Combination and PIPE Financing, we received the aggregate cash consideration of $128.8 million, after deducting the transaction fees incurred by Consonance. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $142.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $48.8 million in cash flows from operations. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future because of additional costs and expenses related to our research and development activities, including increased expenses from pipeline advancement and advancement of our product candidates into and through clinical development and associated regulatory submissions, and increased general and administrative expenses as we scale our organization as a public company.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $123.5 million. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully secure sources of financing and ultimately achieve profitable operations. Insufficient liquidity may require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose.
Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize SZN-1326 and SZN-043 or any future product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to develop SZN-1326 and SZN-043 and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Since our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing and optimizing our Wnt therapeutics platform, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking research and development activities, engaging in strategic transactions, establishing and enhancing our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We expect our expenses to continue to increase in connection with our ongoing activities as we continue to advance SZN-1326 and SZN-043 into clinical development and regulatory approval. In addition, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
In February 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park, pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time over a 36-month period, subject to certain conditions and limitations. There is no assurance that we will be able to receive any or all of the funds from Lincoln Park because of the limitations, restrictions, requirements, events of default and other provisions contained in the purchase agreement that could limit our ability to cause Lincoln Park to purchase our common stock.
We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will provide the capital needed to fund our operations in the short-term. We expect that in the long-term we will need to raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including government grants, potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions as we do not expect sales of common stock to Lincoln Park to be sufficient to provide all necessary financing until we are able to generate revenue on our own. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us at all or on attractive terms when needed from these sources. If we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources when needed, it may be necessary to significantly reduce expenses through reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back operations, or stopping certain research and development programs.
We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of researching and developing our lead product candidates or any future product candidates, conducting preclinical studies, in particular our current ongoing preclinical studies of SZN-1326 and SZN-043;
•the outcome, costs, and timing involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our lead product candidate or our other product candidates;
•the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•the cost of acquiring, licensing, or investing in product candidates and technologies;
•the costs associated with securing and establishing commercialization;
•our ability to maintain, expand, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•our need and ability to retain key management and hire scientific, technical, business, and medical personnel;
•the effect of competing products and product candidates and other market developments;
•the timing, receipt, and amount of sales from SZN-1326 and SZN-043 and any future product candidates, if approved;
•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;
•the economic and other terms, timing of, and success of any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements which we may enter in the future; and
•the effects of the disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our sales of common stock to Lincoln Park, and any future sales of equity securities, will cause our stockholders to experience dilution. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants that restrict our operations including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others our rights to SZN-1326 and SZN-043 and any future product candidates or discovery programs in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves.
Summary of Cash Flows
The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented below (in thousands):
Cash Used in Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities of $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations and the resulting net loss of $54.6 million and a net change of $0.2 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $6.0 million in non-cash charges. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a net increase in prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities.
Cash used in operating activities of $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations and the resulting net loss of $32.7 million and a net change of $0.05 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $3.6 million in non-cash charges. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a net increase in prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities of $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of $91.7 million of cash used for the purchase of marketable securities and $1.3 million of cash used for the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by $15.3 million of proceeds from the sale and maturities of marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $14.2 million of cash used for the purchase of marketable securities and $0.9 million of cash used for the purchase of property and equipment.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities of $124.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of $124.2 million of net proceeds from the Business Combination and PIPE Financing and $0.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of options.
Cash provided by financing activities of $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of net proceeds of $49.9 million from the issuance and sale of shares of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As of December 31, 2021, we have lease obligations consisting of two operating leases for our operating facilities. The leases expire in June 2022 and in April 2025. Under the terms of our operating leases, we had lease obligations consisting of $8.9 million in payments through 2025 as of December 31, 2021.
We are party to license or subscription agreements pursuant to which we have in-licensed various intellectual property rights. The license agreements obligate us to make certain milestone payments related to achievement of specified events, as well as royalties in the low single-digit percentages based on sales of licensed products. The payment obligations under the license agreements are contingent upon future events, such as our achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales. As of December 31, 2021, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party vendors for preclinical research studies, clinical trials, research supplies, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of external and internal expenses directly attributable to the conduct of research and development programs. The external expenses include the costs of services provided by outside contractors, clinical research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations. The internal expenses include the costs of salaries, bonus, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of research equipment, and the facility costs for laboratory space used for research and development activities, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, and general support services.
We have entered into and may continue to enter into license agreements to access and utilize certain technology. In each case, we evaluate if the license agreement results in the acquisition of an asset or a business. To date, none of our license agreements has been considered an acquisition of a business. For asset acquisitions, the upfront payments to acquire such licenses, as well as any future milestone payments made before product approval that do not meet the definition of a derivative, are immediately recognized as research and development expense when they are paid or become payable, provided there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
In September 2020, we were awarded a grant from the National Institute of Health, which would partially fund studies for SZN-043 in an amount up to $1.0 million through August 2021, with the possibility of an additional $2.0 million through August 2025, subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory progress of the project. We record the government grant received as a liability and ratably recognize the amount as a reduction of research and development expenses when the costs related to the grant are incurred.
Accrued Research and Development Expense
We record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing development, within accrued expenses which are significant components of research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is conducted by third-party service providers. We accrue the costs incurred under agreements with these third parties based on estimates of actual work completed in accordance with the respective agreements. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress, or stage of completion or actual timeline (start-date and end-date) of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.
If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust accrued expenses or prepaid expenses accordingly, which impact research and development expenses. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Warrant Liabilities
In connection with the Business Combination, Legacy Surrozen, as the accounting acquirer, was deemed to assume 3,066,651 warrants held by Consonance’s stockholders, or the Public Warrants, and 144,666 warrants held by Consonance’s sponsor, or the Private Placement Warrants. In addition, certain investors subscribed for and purchased an aggregate of 12,020,000 units in the PIPE Financing, consisting of 12,020,000 shares of common stock and 4,006,657 warrants, or the PIPE Warrants.
We accounted for all outstanding warrants as liabilities and recorded at fair value. At the end of each reporting period, changes in fair value during the period are recognized in other expense, net within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair values of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were determined based on the listed trading price of Public Warrants. The fair value of the PIPE Warrants was initially recorded using a binomial lattice model. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the PIPE Warrants was the expected volatility. The expected volatility was implied from the market price of the Public Warrants. A binomial lattice model methodology was also used in estimating the fair value of the Public Warrants for periods where no observable traded price was available, using the same expected volatility as was used in measuring the fair value of the PIPE Warrants. Given the adequate history of the market data of the Public Warrants as of December 31, 2021, the PIPE Warrants were remeasured at December 31, 2021 based on the listed trading price of the Public Warrants. We will continue to adjust the warrant liabilities for changes in the fair value until the earlier of a) the exercise or expiration of the warrants or b) the redemption of the warrants, at which time such warrants will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards. Stock-based compensation costs are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity and recognized as expense, net of actual forfeitures when occur, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
We calculate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of various highly subjective assumptions as follows:
•Fair Value of Common Stock-See the subsection titled “Common Stock Valuations” below.
•Expected Term-We have opted to use the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of contractual term of the option (generally ten years). The expected term for nonemployee awards is calculated based on the remaining contractual life to measure the remaining life of an award.
•Expected Volatility-Due to our limited operating history and a lack of sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock becomes available.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issued in effect at the time of grant with maturities similar to the expected term of our options.
•Expected Dividend Yield-We have not issued any dividends in our history and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock over the life of the options and therefore have estimated the dividend yield to be zero.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and interest rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expense was $2.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had $7.8 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, which we expect to recognize over an estimated weighted-average period of 3.11 years. We expect to continue to grant options and other stock-based awards in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.
Common Stock Valuations
Given the absence of a public trading market of our common stock prior to the Business Combination, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of fair value of our common stock prior to the Business Combination, including, but not limited to:
•relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock;
•contemporaneous valuations performed by third-party specialists;
•rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;
•actual operating and financial performance;
•current business conditions and financial projections;
•likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our business;
•the lack of marketability of our common stock, and the illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company;
•market multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies;
•stage of development;
•industry information such as market size and growth; and
•U.S. and global capital and macroeconomic conditions.
The Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, we considered the following methods:
•Option Pricing Method, or OPM. Under the OPM, shares are valued by creating a series of call options with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences and conversion terms of each equity class. The estimated fair values of the preferred and common stock are inferred by analyzing these options. This method is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is so difficult to predict that estimates would be highly speculative, and dissolution or liquidation is not imminent.
•Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM. The PWERM is a scenario-based analysis that estimates value per share based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to us, as well as the economic and control rights of each share class.
For valuations performed beginning in 2021, prior to the Business Combination, in accordance with the Practice Aid, we used a hybrid approach of the OPM and the PWERM methods to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock as a result of the increasing likelihood of the occurrence of certain discrete events, such as a potential initial public offering, improving market conditions and receptivity of the market to initial public offerings. The enterprise value determined under the OPM and PWERM methods was weighted according to our board of directors’ estimate of the probability of the occurrence of a certain discrete event as of the valuation date. The resulting equity value for the common stock was then divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date of the valuation to derive a per share value on a non-marketable basis. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock on a marketable basis, we then applied a discount for lack of marketability which we derived based on inputs including a company-specific volatility rate, a term equal to the expected time to a future liquidity event and a risk-free rate equal to the yield on treasuries of similar duration.
Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies and the probability of future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the relationships between those assumptions, impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of common stock. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent our management’s best estimate, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.
Following the closing of the Business Combination, the fair value of our common stock has been determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Because of our recent history of operating losses, management believes that recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
We assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position’s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available. Our unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not have an impact on our effective tax rate assuming we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance position. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.
Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, or NOLs, in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We completed an assessment of the available NOLs under Section 382 and determined that we underwent an ownership change in September 2020 and as a result, NOLs attributable to the pre-ownership change are subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the annual limitations caused by the ownership change, it was estimated that approximately $1.3 million of federal tax credit and $24.7 million of California NOL will expire unutilized for income tax purposes, and such amounts are excluded from the carryforward balances of December 31, 2021.
Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense or benefit. To date, there have been no interest or penalties charged in relation to unrecognized tax benefits.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an emerging growth company, or EGC, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act permits companies with EGC status to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date the Company (i) is no longer an EGC or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting standards as of public company effective dates.
In addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an EGC, we intend to rely on such exemptions, we are not required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
We will remain an EGC under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) of 2025, (b) the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer; or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
