ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a compliance and technology transfer services consulting firm with headquarters in Puerto Rico, servicing the Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and Brazil markets. The compliance consulting service sector in those markets consists of local compliance and validation consulting firms, United States dedicated validation and compliance consulting firms and large publicly traded and private domestic and foreign engineering and consulting firms. We provide a broad range of compliance related consulting services. We market our services to pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology, medical devices, cosmetics and food industries, and allied products companies in Puerto Rico, the United States, Europe and Brazil. Our consulting team includes experienced engineering and life science professionals, former quality assurance managers and directors, and professionals with bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees in health sciences and engineering.
We actively operate in Puerto Rico, the United States, Europe and Brazil and pursue to further expand these markets by strengthening our business development infrastructure and by constantly realigning our business strategies as new opportunities and challenges arise.
We market our services with presence in industry trade shows, professional conventions, industry publications and company provided seminars to the industry. Our senior management is also actively involved in the marketing process, especially in marketing to major accounts. Our senior management and staff also concentrate on developing new business opportunities and focus on the larger customer accounts (by number of consultants or dollar volume) and responding to prospective customers’ requests for proposals.
We consider our core business to be Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and international agencies regulatory compliance consulting related services.
The Company holds a tax grant issued by the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (“PRIDCO”), which provides relief on various Puerto Rico taxes, including income tax, with certain limitations, for most of the activities carried on within Puerto Rico, including those that are for services to parties located outside of Puerto Rico.
The following table sets forth information as to our revenue for the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, by geographic regions (dollars in thousands).
For the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company’s revenues were $20.1 million, a net decrease of $1.4 million when compared to last year. The Puerto Rico consulting market had a revenue decrease in projects of approximately $3.5 million, which was partially offset by the increase in projects revenue in the United States, European and Brazilian markets of approximately $0.4, $1.5 and $0.2 million, respectively. When compared to the same period last year, gross profit decreased by 4.2 percentage points. The net decrease in gross profit percentage points is mainly attributable to some projects in the Puerto Rico market for the year ended October 31, 2020, for which the gross profit was higher than usual. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $9.2 million, an increase of approximately $4.8 million when compared to last year. The net increase is mainly attributable to a customer account receivable provision of approximately $5.2 million, non-recurring legal fees of approximately $0.2 million, partially offset by the decrease of consulting fees and other administrative expenses of approximately $0.4 and $0.2 million, respectively. Other income increased by approximately $1.9 million, mainly as the result of the forgiveness of principal and accrued interest of the SBA Loans for a similar amount. These factors resulted in a net loss of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2021, or a decrease in earnings of approximately $4.1 million when compared to last year.
While we have not identified any material adverse effect resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and any potential future impact it may have on our business and results of operations. The extent to which our operations will be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on unknown developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning our customers, the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among other things.
The COVID-19 pandemic, the Puerto Rico government financial crisis, the Tax Reform, and possible tax changes on jurisdictions where we do business, bio-pharmaceutical industry consolidations, trends on managing contract resources, all pose current and future challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. We believe that our future profitability and liquidity will be dependent on the effect the local and global economy, including any impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, changes in tax laws, worldwide life science manufacturing industry consolidations, operational constraints imposed by our customers due to the coronavirus pandemic and resources management trends will have on our operations, and our ability to seek service opportunities and adapt to industry trends.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth our statements of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands, and as a percentage of revenues):
Revenues. Revenues for the year ended October 31, 2021 were $20.1 million, a net decrease of $1.4 million when compared to last year. The net decrease is attributable to the decrease in projects revenue in the Puerto Rico consulting market of approximately $3.5 million, which was partially offset by the increase in projects revenue in the United States, European and Brazilian markets of approximately $0.4, $1.5 and $0.2 million, respectively.
Cost of Services; gross profit. Cost of services for the year ended October 31, 2021 were $14.8 million, a decrease of $0.1 million when compared to last year. The overall gross profit reflected a gross profit decrease of 4.2 percentage points, when compared to last year. The net decrease in gross profit percentage points is mainly attributable to some projects in the Puerto Rico market for the year ended October 31, 2020, which the gross profit were higher than usual.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $9.2 million, an increase of approximately $4.8 million when compared to last year. The net increase is mainly attributable to a customer account receivable provision of approximately $5.2 million, non-recurring legal fees of approximately $0.2 million, partially offset by the decrease of consulting fees and other administrative expenses of approximately $0.4 and $0.2 million, respectively.
Other Income, net. For the year ended on October 31, 2021, other income, net was approximately $2.0 million, a net increase of approximately $1.9 million when compared to last year. The net increase is mainly attributable to the forgiveness of principal and accrued interest of the SBA Loans for approximately $1.9 million.
Net Income (Loss). Net loss for the year ended October 31, 2021 was approximately $2.1 million, a decrease in earnings of approximately $4.1 million when compared to last year. The decrease in net earnings is mostly attributable to (i) a customer account receivable provision, partially offset by net savings on selling, general and administrative expenses, (ii) the forgiveness of principal and accrued interest of the SBA Loans, and (iii) the decrease in revenue and related gross profit, when compared to last year.
For the year ended October 31, 2021, net loss per common share for both basic and diluted were $0.091, a decrease of $0.180 per share when compared to last year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including planned capital expenditures. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $20.2 million in working capital.
On June 13, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to repurchase up to two million shares of its common stock (the "Company Stock Repurchase Program"). The Company Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. To conserve cash due to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 the Company suspended the purchases under the Company Stock Repurchase Program, during September 2021 these were resumed. During the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company purchased an aggregate of 25,600 shares of its common stock under the Company Stock Repurchase Program.
Our primary cash needs consist of the payment of compensation to our consulting team, overhead expenses, and statutory taxes. Additionally, we may use cash for the repurchase of our common stock under the Company Stock Repurchase Program, capital expenditures and business development expenses. Management believes that based on the current level of working capital, operations and cash flows from operations, and the collectability of high quality customer receivables are sufficient to fund anticipated expenses and satisfy other possible long-term contractual commitments.
To the extent that we pursue possible opportunities to expand our operations, either by acquisition or by the establishment of operations in a new market, we will incur additional overhead, and there may be a delay between the period we commence operations and our generation of net cash flow from operations.
While uncertainties relating to the current local and global economic condition, competition, the industries and geographical regions served by us and other regulatory matters exist within the consulting services industry, as described above, management is not aware of any other trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or its financial statements.
Also, as of October 31, 2021, the Company has fully allowed approximately $5.2 million for a customer’s account receivable. The Company has been actively monitoring this account. The Company is aware that in the ordinary course of this customer’s business a significant portion of this customer’s operations are subject to compliance and regulatory approvals. This customer has experienced significant negative changes in its financial terms and challenges in obtaining financing and is also in the process of developing a therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19. At this time, the Company believes the collection of this customer’s account receivable is principally dependent on the commercial success of this therapeutic drug. As a result, the Company is unable to estimate the future cash flows this customer will generate to settle this obligation or the timing of such future cash flows, if any. Nevertheless, the Company will continue to monitor this account and actively seek full payment from this customer.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We were not involved in any significant off-balance sheet arrangements during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies that impact the consolidated financial statements, some of which are based on management’s best estimates available at the time of preparation. Actual experience may differ from these estimates.
Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segments - The Company operates in three reportable business segments: (i) Puerto Rico technical compliance consulting, (ii) United States technical compliance consulting, and (iii) Europe technical compliance consulting. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented to show these three reportable segments.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are considered reasonable estimates of fair value due to their liquidity or short-term nature.
Revenue Recognition - The Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (i) Identify the contract with the customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (v) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue is primarily derived from: (1) time and material contracts (representing approximately 99% of total revenues), and (2) short-term fixed-fee contracts or "not to exceed" contracts (representing approximately 1% of total revenues). Time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates. These service contracts relate to work which have no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the work completed to date. As a result, revenue is recognized over time when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services (known as performance obligations) to its customers. Revenue for short term fixed fee contracts or “not to exceed” contracts is recognized similarly, except that certain milestones also have to be reached before revenue is recognized. If the Company determines that a contract will result in a loss, the Company recognizes the estimated loss in the period in which such determination is made.
Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash equivalents include investments in a money market obligations trust that is registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable are recorded at their estimated realizable value. Accounts are deemed past due when payment has not been received within the stated time period. The Company's policy is to review individual past due amounts periodically and write off amounts for which all collection efforts are deemed to have been exhausted. Due to the nature of the Company’s customers, bad debts are mainly accounted for using the direct write-off method whereby an expense is recognized only when a specific balance is determined to be uncollectible in full. The effect of using this method approximates that of the allowance method. However, in the event the Company determines that the collectability of any account receivable reaches a certain uncertainty threshold, the Company will provide an allowance for doubtful account to reduce said balance.
Income Taxes - We follow an asset and liability approach method of accounting for income taxes. This method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company follows guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) related to Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which includes a two-step approach to recognizing, de-recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had no significant uncertain tax positions that would be reduced as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
Leases - The Company follows accounting standards issued by the FASB for the accounting and disclosure of leases. Under those standards, assets and liabilities that arise from leases are recognized on the balance sheet, and the leases are categorized at their inception as either operating or finance leases.
Operating lease right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term.
Property and Equipment - Owned property and equipment are stated at cost. Vehicles under finance leases are stated at the lower of fair market value or net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the leases.
Depreciation of owned assets are provided for, when placed in service, in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives, using straight-line basis. Assets under finance leases are amortized over the lease term. While expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - The Company evaluates for impairment its long-lived assets to be held and used, and long-lived assets to be disposed of, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on management estimates, no impairment of the long-lived assets was present as of October 31, 2021 and 2020.
Stock-based Compensation - Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which generally represents the vesting period, and includes an estimate of awards that will be forfeited. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at grant date, while for restricted stock units the fair market value of the units is determined by Company’s share market value at grant date. Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are reflected as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating activities. We have not recognized such cash flow from financing activities since there has been no tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock - Basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilution of common stock equivalents.
The diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding were calculated using the treasury stock method for the respective periods.
Foreign Operations - The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The cumulative translation effect for subsidiaries using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders’ equity and as a component of comprehensive income.
Our intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany receivables that we consider to be of a long-term investment nature are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders’ equity and as a component of comprehensive income, while gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany receivables from those international subsidiaries for which we anticipate settlement in the foreseeable future are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses” (ASU 2016-13), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. In addition, the guidance also requires incremental disclosures regarding allowances and credit quality indicators. ASU 2016-13 is required to be adopted using the modified-retrospective approach. For the Company this guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Based on the Company’s preliminary assessment, it currently does not anticipate a material impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
