Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light.
LuViva provides a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva improves patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests.
We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1992 under the name “SpectRx, Inc.” and, on February 22, 2008, changed our name to Guided Therapeutics, Inc. At the same time, we renamed our wholly owned subsidiary, InterScan, which originally had been incorporated as “Guided Therapeutics.”
Since our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants.
Our prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry. This industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants, intense competition and a high failure rate. We have experienced operating losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2021 we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $142.4 million. To date, we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts and the early stages of marketing our products. We do not have significant experience in manufacturing, marketing or selling our products. We may not be successful in growing sales for our products. Moreover, required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. Our products may not ever gain market acceptance and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. The development and commercialization of our products requires substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development.
Our product revenues to date have been limited. In 2021, the majority of our revenues were from the sale of components of our LuViva devices and disposables. We expect that the majority of our revenue in 2022 will be derived from revenue from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables.
Current Demand for LuViva
Based on discussions with our distributors, we currently hold and expect to generate additional purchase orders for approximately $1.5 million in LuViva devices and disposables and expect to recognize revenue for from these sales during 2022. We cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of these additional purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products. In order to increase demand for LuViva, the Company is focused on three primary markets: the United States, China and Europe.
In the United States, the Company is actively pursuing FDA approval by initiating a clinical trial protocol involving approximately 400 study participants. The protocol was drafted with input from FDA and two prestigious clinical centers that will participate in enrolling the 400 women at multiple sites within their hospital systems. Clinical trial agreements have been drafted and agreed upon, the budget at one institution has been agreed upon and is under negotiation at the other institution. The LuViva devices have been prepared and have passed bench testing in order to begin the study. All requested materials have been submitted for review by the respective hospital institutional review boards (IRBs). Once the IRB’s have approved the study, enrollment may begin, which is expected prior to the end of 2022 and last approximately eight to nine months; however, there can be no assurance that the study will be completed by the end of 2022.
In China, the study protocol and budgets have been agreed upon at two clinical centers and the study has begun at one center, with two more to be added this year. This study will enroll approximately 320 women and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022, although there can be no assurance that the study will be completed within this time frame.
In Europe, the Company attended a meeting in Bucharest, Romania on November 3-4, 2021, hosted by our central Eastern and Russian distribution partner. The LuViva system was demonstrated for doctors at a local clinic and the head Ob-Gyn physician intends to keep the LuViva device and order additional Cervical Guides to test patients as part of her practice.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
COMPARISON OF 2021 and 2020
Sales Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit from Devices and Disposables: Revenues from the sale of LuViva devices for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $81,000, compared to $102,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $21,000 or 21%. Cost of goods sold was $61,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cost of goods recovered of $41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of goods recovered in 2020 was the result of the buy-back of parts from one customer that were then sold, resulting in a revaluation of the inventory reserve. Cost of goods sold increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to inventory write-offs of slow-moving inventory. This resulted in gross profit of $20,000 on the sales of devices and disposals for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to gross profit of $143,000 for the same period in 2020.
Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased to $69,000 from $143,000 during the same period in 2020. The decrease of $74,000 or 52% was primarily due to a reduction in research and development clinical costs and payroll expenses.
Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 has remained consistent with the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to approximately $2,172,000 compared to $913,000 during the same period in 2020. The increase of approximately $1,259,000, or 138%, was primarily due to a charge of $556,000 for warrants issued to Mr. Blumberg for consulting services and consulting expenses of $228,000 for warrants issued to finders in the capital raises. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reversed $292,000 of a reserve taken for a deposit made for inventory parts for its devices, which lowered general and administrative expenses in the prior period. The remaining increase in current period general and administrative expenses was due to minimal increases in rent expense, payroll-related expenses, and miscellaneous other expenses.
Interest Expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to approximately $1,150,000, compared to $1,056,000 during the same period in 2020. The increase of approximately $94,000, or 9%, was primarily due to a $350,000 prepayment penalty incurred on short-term convertible notes payable, offset by lower interest incurred for outstanding notes payable and convertible debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Fair Value of Derivative Liability: Loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative liability was $91,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $25,000 during the same period in 2020. The increase in the loss of $66,000, or 264%, was due to changes in the fair value of the associated derivative liability and extinguishment due to a $700,000 payoff of the associated loan.
Gain (Loss) from Extinguishment of Debt: During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $578,000, compared to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $296,000 during the same period in 2020. The gain from debt extinguished in 2021 was primarily due to forgiveness of debt principal and accrued interest totaling $578,000 during 2021. The loss of $296,000 recognized in the prior period was related to debt eliminated from debt exchange agreements.
Change in Fair Value of Warrants: The gain recorded due to change in fair value of warrants was $448,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,879,000 during the same period in 2020. The decrease of $1,431,000, or 76%, was primarily due to an exchange agreement signed with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC (“GPB”), which resulted changes to the terms of the warrants and reclassification of the warrants from liabilities to equity.
Other Income: Other income during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $507,000, compared to $271,000 during the same period in 2020. The increase of $236,000, or 87%, was primarily due to the write-off of a $350,000 subscription receivable liability during 2021. The increase was offset by additional income recorded for recovery of employment expenses and aged payables with had exceeded their statute of limitations on collectability during 2020.
Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $2,431,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $401,000 during the same period in the prior year. The increase in net loss of $2,030,000 or 506% was due to the reasons described above.
There was no income tax benefit recorded for 2021 or 2020, due to recurring net operating losses.

Contingencies
Based on the current outbreak of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19, which has already had an impact on financial markets, there could be additional repercussions in our operating business, including but not limited to, the sourcing of materials for product candidates, manufacture of supplies for preclinical and/or clinical studies, delays in clinical operations, which may include the availability or the continued availability of patients for trials due to such things as quarantines, conduct of patient monitoring and clinical trial data retrieval at investigational study sites.
The future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and we cannot provide any assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or future results or filings with regulatory health authorities. The extent of the impact, if any, we will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain the coronavirus.
The conflict in Ukraine, which has already had an impact on financial markets, could result in additional repercussions in our operating business, including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to market our products in Russia. The future impact of the conflict is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and we cannot provide any assurance that the conflict will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or future results or filings with regulatory health authorities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, no special purpose entities, and no activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value.
