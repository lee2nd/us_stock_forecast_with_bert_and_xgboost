Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
We are an integrated producer of high-performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical, electronic, thermal, and structural applications. Our products are sold into numerous end markets, including semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center.
COVID-19 Update
In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized a novel strain of the coronavirus, known as COVID-19, as a pandemic. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term impacts on the economy are uncertain and could impact the Company’s estimates. Management continues to manage global macroeconomic impacts on supply chains, inflationary costs, and labor availability and costs, all of which impacted the Company throughout 2021.
HCS-Electronic Materials Acquisition
On September 19, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement under which it has agreed to acquire HCS-Electronic Materials from H.C. Starck Group GmbH for a purchase price of approximately $395.9 million in cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment mechanism. Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs totaled $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2021. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. On November 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition. The Company financed the purchase price for the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition with a new $300 million five-year term loan pursuant to a delayed draw term loan facility entered into during October 2021 and $103 million of borrowings under its amended revolving credit facility, which was also extended to expire five years in October 2026.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2021 Compared to 2020
Net sales of $1,510.6 million in 2021 increased $334.3 million from $1,176.3 million in 2020. Each segment recorded strong increases in sales when compared to the prior year, as sales in Performance Alloys and Composites grew 30%, sales in Advanced Materials grew 29% and sales in Precision Optics grew 19%. Strong market demand and our ability to capitalize on new business opportunities drove most of the increase. The change in precious metal and copper prices favorably impacted net sales during 2021 by $47.4 million. Sales in 2021 also included a full year of Optics Balzers sales and two months of HCS-Electronic Materials sales as compared to five and a half months of Optics Balzers sales in 2020.
Value-added sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of pass-through metal costs and allows for analysis without the distortion of the movement or volatility in metal prices and changes in mix due to customer-supplied material. Internally, we manage our business on this basis, and a reconciliation of net sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to value-added sales is included herein. Value-added sales of $859.7 million in 2021 were up 29% compared to 2020. The increase was due to strong demand across all of our markets and our ability to capitalize on new business opportunities.
Gross margin was $283.8 million in 2021, a 47% increase from the $192.6 million gross margin recorded in 2020. Gross margin expressed as a percentage of value-added sales increased to 33% in 2021 from 29% in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by strong product demand across all of our manufacturing sites as core markets rebounded in 2021 and the Company's strong operating performance.
SG&A expense totaled $163.8 million in 2021 as compared to $134.0 million in 2020. The increase in SG&A expense for 2021 was primarily driven by the Optics Balzers and HCS-Electronic Materials additions, related transaction and integration costs from the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition and higher variable compensation costs based on the strong 2021 operating performance. Expressed as a percentage of value-added sales, SG&A expense decreased 100 basis points in 2021 to 19% compared to 20% in 2020.
R&D expense consists primarily of direct personnel costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new products, prototypes, and applications. R&D expense was $26.6 million in 2021, an increase of 31% compared to 2020. R&D costs as a percentage of value-added sales remained at 3%. The increase in R&D expense reflects the full-year impact of the Optics Balzers acquisition and the additional investment in new product and application development.
Goodwill and Asset impairment charges were $0 in 2021. Refer to Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding 2020.
Restructuring expense consists primarily of cost reduction actions taken in order to improve the efficiency of our operations. We incurred no material restructuring costs in 2021. All 2021 activity was related to final resolution of 2020 accrual balances that were remaining from the restructuring actions taken in 2020 when we recorded $11.2 million of restructuring charges associated with the permanent closure of our Warren, Michigan and Fremont, California facilities in our Performance Alloys and Composites segment and the closure of our Large Area Coatings (LAC) business in our Precision Optics segment.
Refer to Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Other-net totaled expense of $16.7 million and $8.5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in Other-net was driven by an increase in acquisition amortization due to the acquisition of HCS-Electronic Materials in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a full year of amortization from the Optics Balzers acquisition plus $3.3 million foreign exchange hedge gain realized in 2020 that did not reoccur in 2021. Refer to Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the major components within Other-net.
Other non-operating (income) expense-net includes components of pension and post-retirement expense other than service costs. Refer to Note P of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of net periodic benefit costs.
Interest expense - net was $4.9 million in 2021 and $3.9 million in 2020. The increase in interest expense in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to borrowings under our new term loan facility and increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of funding the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition.
Income tax expense (benefit) for 2021 was $4.9 million of expense compared to $7.2 million of benefit in 2020. The effects of percentage depletion, foreign derived intangible income deduction, and the release of a valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction were the primary factors for the difference between the effective and statutory tax rates in 2021. Refer to Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on income taxes.
See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of our results for 2020 compared to 2019.
Segment Disclosures
The Company has four reportable segments: Performance Alloys and Composites, Advanced Materials, Precision Optics, and Other. The Other reportable segment includes unallocated corporate costs.
Performance Alloys and Composites
2021 Compared to 2020
Net sales from the Performance Alloys and Composites segment of $511.9 million in 2021 increased 30% compared to 2020. The increase was due to higher sales into all major end markets, the largest of which were in the industrial, automotive, aerospace & defense and other end markets.
Value-added sales of $440.4 million in 2021 were 28% higher than value-added sales of $345.3 million in 2020. The increase in value-added sales was driven by the same factors driving the increase in net sales.
Performance Alloys and Composites generated operating profit of $67.9 million, or 15.4% of value-added sales, in 2021 as compared to $13.6 million, or 4% of value-added sales, in 2020. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased sales volume, and no mine development costs in 2021 compared to $12.9 million of mine development costs recorded in 2020. In addition, there were no restructuring charges in 2021 compared to $8.8 million that were recorded in 2020 related to the closure of our Warren, Michigan and Fremont, California facilities.
Advanced Materials
2021 Compared to 2020
Net sales from the Advanced Materials segment of $866.8 million in 2021 were 29% higher than net sales of $670.9 million in 2020. The increase in net sales was due to higher sales volumes totaling $146.5 million, sales from HCS-Electronic Materials totaling $21.4 million and pass-through metal prices totaling $30 million.
Value-added sales of $289.1 million increased 31% compared to value-added sales of $220.5 million in 2020. Higher sales volumes into the semiconductor, industrial and energy markets accounted for $47.2 million and the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition accounted for the remaining $21.4 million of the increase.
During the first quarter of 2021, we added ruthenium, iridium, rhodium, rhenium, and osmium to our definition of value-added sales as the costs of these materials are treated as pass-through and the business use and price volatility of these materials has increased in recent periods. Prior period value-added sales amounts have been recast to reflect this change.
Advanced Materials generated operating profit of $35.3 million in 2021, compared to $22.1 million in 2020. Increased operating profit in 2021, compared to 2020, was the result of strong demand across all of our product lines and improved product mix.
Precision Optics
2021 Compared to 2020
Net sales from the Precision Optics segment were $132.0 million in 2021, an increase compared to net sales of $111.2 million in 2020. The increase was due to the full year impact of the Optics Balzers acquisition offset in part by the closure of our LAC business on December 31, 2020.
Value-added sales of $131.8 million in 2021 increased 29% compared to value-added sales of $101.9 million in 2020. The increase was driven by the full year impact of the Optics Balzers acquisition, which was partially offset by the closure of our LAC business on December 31, 2020.
The Precision Optics segment generated operating profit of $14.2 million in 2021 compared to an operating loss of $4.3 million in 2020. The operating profit was driven by the full year impact of the Optics Balzers acquisition. The 2020 operating loss includes impairment charges of $10.5 million and restructuring charges of $2.1 million primarily related to the closure of our LAC business.
Other
2021 Compared to 2020
The Other reportable segment in total includes unallocated corporate costs.
Corporate costs of $40.3 million in 2021 increased $17.2 million as compared to $23.1 million in 2020. Corporate costs were 5% of total Company value-added sales in 2021 compared to 3% in 2020. The increase in corporate costs in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the transaction costs related to the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition and higher variable compensation expense related to strong 2021 operating performance.
Value-Added Sales - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure
A reconciliation of net sales to value-added sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, for each reportable segment and for the Company in total for 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:
During the first quarter of 2021, we added ruthenium, iridium, rhodium, rhenium, and osmium to our definition of value-added sales as the costs of these materials are treated as pass-through and the business use and price volatility of these materials has increased in recent periods. Prior period value-added sales amounts have been recast to reflect this change.
The cost of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, ruthenium, iridium, rhodium, rhenium, and osmium can be quite volatile. Our pricing policy is to directly pass the cost of these metals on to the customer in order to mitigate the impact of metal price volatility on our results from operations. Trends and comparisons of net sales are affected by movements in the market prices of these metals, but changes in net sales due to metal price movements may not have a proportionate impact on our profitability.
Internally, management reviews net sales on a value-added basis. Value-added sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that deducts the value of the pass-through metal costs from net sales. Value-added sales allow management to assess the impact of differences in net sales between periods, segments, or markets, and analyze the resulting margins and profitability without the distortion of movements in pass-through metal costs. The dollar amount of gross margin and operating profit is not affected by the value-added sales calculation. We sell other metals and materials that are not considered direct pass-throughs, and these costs are not deducted from net sales when calculating value-added sales.
Our net sales are also affected by changes in the use of customer-supplied metal. When we manufacture a precious metal product, the customer may purchase metal from us or may elect to provide its own metal, in which case we process the metal on a toll basis, and the metal value does not flow through net sales or cost of sales. In either case, we generally earn our margin based upon our fabrication efforts. The relationship of this margin to net sales can change depending upon whether or not the product was made from our metal or the customer’s metal. The use of value-added sales removes the potential distortion in the comparison of net sales caused by changes in the level of customer-supplied metal.
By presenting information on net sales and value-added sales, it is our intention to allow users of our financial statements to review our net sales with and without the impact of the pass-through metals.
FINANCIAL POSITION
Cash Flow
A summary of cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $90.2 million in 2021 versus $101.1 million in 2020. Decreased operating cash flow was due in part to the increase in A/R of $29.8 million to support higher sales in 2021 and a decrease in customer prepayments of $40.3 million was partially offset by $56.8 million of increased net income. Working capital requirements used cash of $33.7 million during 2021 compared to a use of $23.9 million in 2020. Cash flows used for inventory were $43.5 million in 2021, compared to using $1.3 million of cash in the prior year primarily in our Performance Alloys and Composites and Advanced Materials segments. Price movements of precious and base metals are passed through to customers. Therefore, while sudden movements in the price of metals can cause a temporary imbalance in our cash receipts and payments in either direction, once prices stabilize, our cash flow tends to stabilize as well. Cash flows generated from accounts payable and accrued expenses were $40.2 million compared to the prior-year use of cash of $21.9 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $494.2 million in 2021 compared to $194.7 million in 2020 due to a $393 million payment, net of cash acquired, for the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition. In addition, capital expenditures increased by $35.6 million in 2021, compared to 2020, due to investments in new equipment funded in part by customer prepayments. See Notes B and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $400.1 million from 2020 primarily due to net borrowings of $384.3 million, of which $84.3 million was from our revolving credit facility and $300 million from a new term loan, partially offset by the paydown of $2.1 million of long-term debt, most of which was assumed in the Optics Balzers acquisition.
Dividends per common share increased 4% to $0.475 per share in 2021. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $9.7 million in 2021 and $9.3 million in 2020. In May 2021, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.115 to $0.12 per share. We intend to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis, subject to a continuing strong capital structure and a determination that the dividend remains in the best interest of our shareholders.
Liquidity
We believe that cash flow from operations plus available borrowing capacity and our current cash balance are adequate to support operating requirements, capital expenditures, projected pension plan contributions, the current dividend and share repurchase programs, environmental remediation projects, and strategic acquisitions. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations totaled $12.5 million. We do not expect restrictions on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition, or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.
A summary of key data relative to our liquidity, including the outstanding debt, cash balances, and available borrowing capacity, as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is as follows:
Net (debt) cash is a non-GAAP financial measure. We are providing this information because we believe it is more indicative of our overall financial position. It is also a measure our management uses to assess financing and other decisions. We believe that based on our typical cash flow generated from operations, we can support a higher leverage ratio in future periods.
The available borrowing capacity in the table above represents the additional amounts that could be borrowed under our revolving credit facility and other secured lines existing as of the end of each year depicted. The applicable debt covenants have been taken into account when determining the available borrowing capacity, including the covenant that restricts borrowing capacity to a multiple of the twelve-month trailing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments.
In 2021, we amended and restated the agreement governing our $375.0 million revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) in connection with the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition. A $300 million delayed draw term loan facility was added to the Credit Agreement and the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended from 2024 to 2026. Moreover, the Credit Agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility whereby, under certain conditions, the Company may be able to borrow additional term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement provides the Company and its subsidiaries with additional capacity to enter into facilities for the consignment, borrowing, or leasing of precious metals and copper, and provides enhanced flexibility to finance acquisitions and other strategic initiatives. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its direct subsidiaries, with the exception of non-mining real property, precious metal, copper and certain other assets.
The Credit Agreement allows the Company to borrow money at a premium over LIBOR or prime rate and at varying maturities. The premium resets quarterly according to the terms and conditions stipulated in the agreement. The Credit Agreement includes restrictive covenants relating to restrictions on additional indebtedness, acquisitions, dividends, and stock repurchases. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes covenants that limit the Company to a maximum leverage ratio and a maximum interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Cash on hand up to $25 million can benefit the covenants and may benefit the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement.
In November 2021, we completed the acquisition of HCS-Electronic Materials. The Company financed the purchase price for the HCS-Electronic Materials acquisition with a new $300 million five-year term loan pursuant to its delayed draw term loan facility under the Credit Agreement and $103 million of borrowings under of borrowings under its amended revolving credit facility. The interest rate for the term loan is based on LIBOR plus a tiered rate determined by the Company's quarterly leverage ratio.
Portions of our business utilize off-balance sheet consignment arrangements to finance metal requirements. Expansion of business volumes and/or higher metal prices can put pressure on the consignment line limitations from time to time. The precious metal consignment agreement, entered into in 2019 and maturing on August 27, 2022, was amended in 2021 to be consistent with the Credit Agreement. The available and unused capacity under the metal financing lines totaled approximately $69.8 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $50.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The availability is determined by Board approved levels and actual line capacity. The Board approved a $100.0 million capacity increase in 2021 to better support customer demand.
In January 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. The timing of the share repurchases will depend on several factors, including market and business conditions, our cash flow, debt levels, and other investment opportunities. There is no minimum number of common shares required to be repurchased in a given year, and the repurchases may be discontinued at any time. We did not repurchase any shares in 2021. Since the approval of the repurchase plan, we have purchased 1,254,264 shares at a total cost of $41.7 million, or an average of $33.23 per share.
Material Future Cash Obligations
The following table summarizes our material future cash obligations as of December 31, 2021:
(1) Refer to Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our total debt, excluding any interest payments to be made on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
(3) Refer to Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) The non-cancelable lease payments represent payments under operating leases with initial lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2021.
(5) Other long-term liabilities include environmental remediation costs. We have an active environmental compliance program. We estimate the probable cost of identified environmental remediation projects and establish reserves accordingly. The environmental remediation reserve balance was $4.8 million at December 31, 2021 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2020. Environmental projects tend to be long term, and the associated payments are typically made over a number of years. Refer to Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Off-balance Sheet Obligations
We maintain the majority of the precious metals and copper we use in production on a consignment basis in order to reduce our exposure to metal price movements and to reduce our working capital investment. Refer to
