Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a FinTech company and PayFac that focuses on a suite of products in the merchant services and payment facilitator verticals that seeks to provide integrated business solutions to merchants throughout the United States. We seek to accomplish this by providing merchants with a wide range of products and services through our various online platforms, including financial and transaction processing services. We also have products that provide support for crowdfunding and other capital raising initiatives. We supplement our online platforms with certain hardware solutions that are integrated with our online platforms. Our business functions primarily through three wholly-owned subsidiaries, eVance, OmniSoft, and CrowdPay, though substantially all of our revenue has been generated from our eVance business (we began generating revenue from our OmniSoft and CrowdPay businesses in the second half of 2019). We expect to build out our OmniSoft software business and to rely more on our PayFac model for revenue so that we are not dependent on our revenue from our eVance business but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.
With respect to our eVance business, our merchants are currently processing over $100,000,000 in gross transactions monthly and average approximately 1,400,000 transactions a month. These transactions come from a variety of sources including direct accounts and ISO channels. The accounts consist of businesses across the United States with no concentration of industries or merchants.
We have integrated all the applications for OmniSoft and the ShopFast Omnicommerce solution with the eVance mobile payment gateway, SecurePay.comTM. SecurePay.comTM, is currently used by approximately 3,000 merchants processing over 32,000 transactions and approximately $9,000,000 of monthly gross transactions (though our revenue from these transactions is limited). In July 2019, we launched a new merchant and ISO boarding system that will be able to onboard merchants instantly. This provides the merchant with an automated approval and ISOs will have the ability to see all their merchants and their residuals as they load to the system.
On May 22, 2020, the Company purchased certain assets from POSaBIT Inc. (“POSaBIT”), including its contracts and arrangements with the Doublebeam merchant payment processing platform (the “POSaBIT Asset Acquisition”). The assets included, but were not limited to, software source codes, customer lists, customer contracts, hardware and website domains.
On May 14, 2021, the Company formed OLBit, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary (“OLBit”). The purpose of OLBit is to hold the Company’s assets and operate its business related to its emerging cryptocurrency-related lending and transactional business.
On July 23, 2021, we formed DMINT, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary (“DMINT”) to operate in the cryptocurrency mining industry. DMINT has initiated the first phase of the cryptocurrency mining operation by placing purchase orders for data centers and ASIC-based Antminer S19J Pro mining computers specifically configured to mine Bitcoin. The first lot of equipment is being used to establish a proof of concept before DMINT expands the number of computers in operation. As of December 31, 2021, DMint has purchased 1,000 computers, of which 650 computers have been delivered with 250 online and mining for Bitcoin, 400 computers are in process of being installed and 350 computers are scheduled for delivery in 2022. It has six data centers located in Pennsylvania where it has mined ten Bitcoin. It has entered into an exclusive agreement whereby it has rights to all of the natural gas produced by 15 mines in Bradford, Pennsylvania. The natural gas is taken directly from the well heads to generate electricity required to power the mining computers. As configured, it is expected that the computers purchased will have a combined computing power of approximately 100 petahash per second. If the initial mining operation results are as anticipated, DMINT plans to expand the number of mining computers every quarter, whereby it would aim to have the computing power of 500 petahash per second by the end of 2022.
On January 3, 2022, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with all of the shareholders of Crowd Ignition, Inc. (“Crowd Ignition”) whereby the Company would purchase 100% of the equity of Crowd Ignition in exchange for 1,318,408 shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 of the Company (the “CI Issued Shares”). The value of the CI Issued Shares was, for purposes of the Agreement, based on the closing trading price of the Company on October 1, 2021 (the date on which a third-party fairness opinion was issued), resulting in an aggregate purchase price for Crowd Ignition of $5.3 million.
Crowd Ignition is a web-based crowdfunding software system. Ronny Yakov, Chairman and CEO of the Company and John Herzog, a significant shareholder of the Company, own 100% of the equity of Crowd Ignition. The software provides broker-dealer, merchant banks and law firms a platform to market crowdfunding offerings, collect payments and issue securities. The software has been developed in response to, and to comply with, recent changes in investment regulations including Regulation D 506(b) and 506(v), Regulation A+ and Title III of the Jobs Act (Regulation CF), including raising the crowdfunding limit from $1.07 million to $5.0 million. Crowd Ignition is one of only about 50 companies registered with the SEC to provide the services permitted under Regulation CF.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total revenue of $16,710,759 compared to $9,766,621 of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6,944,138 or 71.1%. We earned $15,810,626 in transaction and processing fees, $131,802 in merchant equipment sales, $464,327 in other revenue from monthly recurring subscriptions and $304,004 of other revenue from the Cryptocurrency Mining segment, compared to $8,358,459 in transaction and processing fees, $88,538 in merchant equipment sales and $1,319,624 in other revenue during the prior year (the Company did not have revenue from the Cryptocurrency Mining segment in 2020).
Our transaction and processing fee revenue increased $7,452,167 in the current year. The increase was a result of an increase in the amount of fees earned from merchant processing transactions due to an increased number of transactions during 2021 compared to the prior year and an increase in the number of rentals and sales of merchant equipment. The increase was primarily due to the revenue attributed to the merchant portfolio acquired in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had processing and servicing costs of $13,480,212 compared to $6,003,931 of processing and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Processing and servicing costs increased by $7,476,281 or 124.5%. Processing and servicing costs increased in conjunction with the increased revenue.
Amortization and depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,890,899 compared to $844,423 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,046,476 or 123.9%. We record amortization expense on our merchant portfolio, trademarks and natural gas purchase rights. Our amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $1,241,589, which increased in the current year due to the agreement with Cai Energy to purchase natural gas to operate the cryptocurrency mining computers used in the Cryptocurrency Mining segment. Our deprecation increased in the current year to $649,310, due to the acquisition of Cryptocurrency Mining equipment.
Salary and wage expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,126,451 compared to $1,363,451 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $763,000 or 56%. Salary and wage expense increased in the current period due to bonuses paid to our CEO and President for the Company’s performance in 2020 and 2021 and new employees hired during the year.
Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,590,520 compared to $769,159 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $821,361 or 106.8%. Professional fees consist mainly of audit and legal fees. In the current year our legal expense increased approximately $981,000, which was offset with a decrease in our audit fees of approximately $159,000.
General and Administrative (“G&A”) expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,387,416 compared to $1,520,362 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $867,054 or 57%. Some of our larger G&A expenses included rent of $106,000, stock-based compensation of $461,000, contracted services of $624,000 and computer and internet expense of $332,000.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $116,737 of interest expense, compared to $1,043,933 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $927,196 or 185.6% The decrease in interest expense is primarily due the conversion of all related party debt during the third quarter of 2020 and the repayment of the Term Loan. In the current year we recognized a $236,231 gain on forgiveness of debt for the forgives of our PPP loan. We also recognized litigation liability expense of $333,158.
Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,978,358 compared to $1,776,727 for year ended December 31, 2020. We had an increase in our net loss of $3,201,631 for the reasons discussed above.
Trends and Uncertainties
The Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the next fiscal year 2022 may be adversely affected by a further prolonging of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The New York and Atlanta areas, including the location of the Company’s corporate headquarters and its operations business, continued to experience impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. The Company is currently following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees and visitors. However, the scale and duration of this pandemic remains unknown. If there was another increase in cases requiring quarantines or closures of businesses, the duration of the business disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. While the Company is currently implementing specific business continuity plans to reduce the potential impact of COVID-19 during 2022 and believe that its business being principally operated using digital platforms, in the long-term, will suffer minimal ongoing negative impact, there is no guarantee that the Company’s continuity plan will be successful, that the Company’s merchants will meet the number of forecasted transactions due to a change in consumer activity around point of sale purchasing resulting from the temporary closure of businesses in the future.
In 2021, as a result of the continued high transmission of COVID-19 cases requiring quarantines and convalescence of so many people, the Company experienced some disruptions to its business and disruptions for the Company’s customers and merchants that had an impact on the number of transactions processed by the Company. The extent to which COVID-19 or any other health epidemic may impact the Company’s results for 2022 and beyond will depend on future developments and impacts of variants of the virus, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the continuing economic impact of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, COVID-19 could still have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects during 2022 and beyond.

In addition, the underwriter fully exercised its option to purchase 210,000 Series A warrants and 52,500 Series B warrants. While 20% of the net proceeds of $5.5 million was used to repay a portion of our outstanding Term Loan, immediately following the Offering, the Company had cash of $5.6 million on hand. As such, the Company believes it will be able fund future liquidity and capital requirements through cash flows generated from its operating activities for a period of at least twelve months from the date its condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.
