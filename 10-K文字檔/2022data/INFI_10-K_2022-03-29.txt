Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage innovative biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing novel medicines for people with cancer. We combine proven scientific expertise with a passion for developing novel small molecule drugs that target disease pathways for potential applications in oncology. We are focusing on advancing eganelisib, also known as IPI-549, an orally administered, clinical-stage, immuno-oncology product candidate that selectively inhibits the enzyme phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma, or PI3K-gamma. We believe eganelisib is the only selective inhibitor of PI3K-gamma being investigated in clinical trials. We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to eganelisib, subject to certain success-based milestone payment obligations to our licensor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, as described in more detail under Part I, Item 1, “Business Overview - Alliances, Collaborations, and Other Arrangements - Takeda.”
MARIO-3 (MAcrophage Reprogramming in Immuno-Oncology-3)
MARIO-3 is a multi-arm Phase 2 study designed to evaluate eganelisib in the front-line treatment for both metastatic triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. The TNBC cohort is evaluating eganelisib in combination with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody also known as Tecentriq®, and nab-paclitaxel, an albumin-bound chemotherapy drug also known as Abraxane®, in approximately 60 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The RCC cohort is evaluating eganelisib in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, also known as Avastin®, in approximately 30 patients with RCC. We entered into clinical supply agreements with Roche under which Roche has agreed to supply atezolizumab and bevacizumab for our use in MARIO-3.
On December 10, 2021, we presented data at the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, or SABCS, from the TNBC cohort of our ongoing MARIO-3 study, a multi-arm Phase 2 study designed to evaluate eganelisib in the front-line setting for TNBC and front-line renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. The TNBC cohort is evaluating eganelisib in combination with atezolizumab, also known as Tecentriq®, and nab-paclitaxel, also known as Abraxane®, in up to approximately 60 patients with front-line TNBC. As of the October 2, 2021 data cutoff date, we had enrolled 44 evaluable patients and 50 patients total, with a median duration of follow up of 9.9 months. Using the same cutoff standard used in the F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., or Roche, benchmark IMpassion130 study for a protein called programmed-death ligand 1, or PD-L1, we refer to patients with tumors that test below 1% PD-L1 at baseline as “PD-L1(-) patients” and those with tumors that test equal to or greater than 1% as “PD-L1(+) patients.” The MARIO-3 data presented at SABCS and an investor event following SABCS include the following findings:
•Of evaluable patients, tumor reduction was observed in 92.8% of patients with PD-L1(+) tumors and 85.2% of patients with PD-L1(-) tumors
•Disease control rate (DCR)
◦92.8% (13/14) DCR in patients with PD-L1(+) tumors: complete response (CR) 14.3% (2/14), partial response (PR) 57.1% (8/14), stable disease (SD) 21.4% (3/14)
◦81.4% (22/27) DCR in patients with PD-L1(-) tumors: CR 0% (0/27), PR 48.1% (13/27), SD 33.3% (9/27)
•Progression free survival (PFS)
◦In patients with PD-L1(+) tumors, median PFS in MARIO-3 was 11.0 months, a 47% improvement in median PFS compared to the 7.5 months reported for the atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel doublet in IMpassion130
◦In patients with PD-L1(-) tumors, median PFS in MARIO-3 was 7.3 months, a 30% improvement compared to the 5.6 months reported for the atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel doublet in IMpassion130
•67% of the PD-L1(-) patients who reached the median PFS of 7.3 months remained on treatment
We expect to provide updated data from the MARIO-3 TNBC cohort in the second half of 2022. Enrollment has been completed in the RCC cohort and we expect to present data from the RCC cohort in the second half of 2022.
MARIO-275
MARIO-275 is our global, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluating the effect of adding eganelisib to nivolumab, also known as Opdivo®, in checkpoint-naïve advanced urothelial cancer, or UC, patients whose cancer has progressed or recurred following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy commercialized by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Further details regarding the study are provided under the section entitled Part I, Item 1, “Business Overview - Eganelisib Clinical Development Program - MARIO-275).” The following are the key developments related to MARIO-275:
We presented MARIO-275 data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, or ASCO GU, in February 2021, and presented updates on overall survival data in July 2021 and January 2022. The data from the 49 patients enrolled in the trial include the following findings:
•Median overall survival (mOS) in the intent to treat population as of July 2021 was 15.4 months (6.2, NE) on the eganelisib plus nivolumab combination arm as compared to 7.9 months (2.3, NE) on the control arm of nivolumab alone with a hazard ratio (HR) 0.62 (0.28, 1.36), reflecting a 38% lower probability of death.
◦In a one-year landmark analysis of the ITT population, 59% of patients in the nivolumab combination were alive, compared to 32% in the nivolumab control arm.
•The mOS in PD-L1(-) patients, as updated in January 2022, was 15.3 months (4.7, NE) on the eganelisib plus nivolumab arm versus 7.9 months (1.9, NE) on the nivolumab control arm with an HR 0.58 (0.21, 1.66), reflecting a 42% lower probability of death.
◦In a one-year landmark analysis of patients with PD-L1(-) tumors, 54% on the eganelisib plus nivolumab combination remained alive, compared to 17% in the nivolumab control arm.
The most common TEAEs for the eganelisib plus nivolumab combination arm across all doses, all causality, were pyrexia (33.3%), decreased appetite (30.3%), pruritus (27.3%), asthenia (27.3%), rash (27.3%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (24.2%); and the most common ≥Grade 3 TEAEs across all doses, all causality, were anemia (12.1%), and hepatic AEs including hepatotoxicity (15.2%), increased ALT (12.1%), and increased AST (12.1%) with no Hy’s Law. No Grade 5 AEs were reported.
2022 Eganelisib Development Strategy: Advancing and Expanding MARIO Clinical Development Program
Building on data from MARIO-275 and MARIO-3, we expect to initiate two new studies in 2022. We are planning a randomized, double-blind, registration study in front-line mTNBC, which we refer to as MARIO-4. For the PD-L1(-) patients in the future MARIO-4 study, eganelisib in combination with chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor (the eganelisib triplet) will be evaluated against chemotherapy. In the PD-L1(+) patients, the eganelisib triplet will be evaluated against the combination of chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. We expect MARIO-4 to include endpoints of PFS and OS. Pending feedback from a MARIO-3 end-of-Phase 2 meeting with global regulatory authorities, we will finalize the MARIO-4 trial design. We also expect to initiate MARIO-P, a platform study to evaluate the clinical benefit of eganelisib to support the initiation of future registration focused studies across various solid tumor indications, on a rolling basis beginning in the third quarter of 2022.
Financial Overview
Revenue
To date, all of our revenue has been generated under collaboration agreements, including payments to us of upfront license fees, funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and royalties on product sales. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships, as well as royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. We expect that any potential future revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursement, milestone, royalty and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized.
Research and Development Expense
We are a drug development company. Our research and development expense has historically consisted primarily of the following:
•compensation of personnel associated with research and development activities;
•clinical testing costs, including payments made to contract research organizations;
•costs of combination and comparator drugs used in clinical studies;
•costs of manufacturing product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies;
•costs associated with the licensing of research and development programs;
•preclinical testing costs, including costs of toxicology studies;
•fees paid to external consultants;
•fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials;
•costs for collaboration partners to perform research and development activities, including development milestones for which a payment is due when achieved;
•depreciation of equipment; and
•allocated costs of facilities.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation of personnel in executive, finance, accounting, legal and intellectual property, information technology, corporate communications, and human resources functions. Other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services.
Royalty Expense
Royalty expense is recorded when incurred and represents the expense associated with amounts owed to third parties as a result of royalty revenue recognized and the amounts owed by us to Takeda in relation to sale of future royalties.
Other Income and Expense
Other income and expense typically consist of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, non-cash interest expense, and changes in fair value of warrant liability.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to cumulative revenue related to variable consideration, accrued expenses, estimates of future net royalty payments used in the calculation of our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and assumptions in the valuation of stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Differences between actual and estimated results have not been material and have been adjusted in the period they become known. We believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our significant accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
To date, all our revenue has been generated under collaboration agreements, including payments to us of upfront license fees, funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and/or royalties on product sales.
We recognize revenue when we transfer goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services. These principles are applied using a five-step model: 1) identify the customer contract; 2) identify the contract’s performance obligations; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. We evaluate all promised goods and services within a customer contract and determine which of those are separate performance obligations. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether the good or service is capable of being distinct and whether the good or service is separable from other promises in the contract. When a performance obligation is satisfied, we recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price, excluding estimates of variable consideration that are constrained, that is allocated to that performance obligation. For contracts that contain variable consideration, such as milestone payments, we estimate the amount of variable consideration by using either the expected value method or the most likely amount method. In making this assessment, we evaluate factors such as the clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone. Each reporting period we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraints. We will include variable consideration, without constraint, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
We recognize sales-based milestones and royalty revenue based upon net sales by the licensee of licensed products in licensed territories, and in the period the sales occur under the sales- and usage-based royalty exception when the sole or predominate item to which the royalty relates is a license to intellectual property.
In the event of an early termination of a collaboration agreement, any contract liabilities would be recognized in the period in which all our obligations under the agreement have been fulfilled.
Accrued Expenses
As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date. Examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies. In connection with these service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers, or if we under- or over-estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period, our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high, respectively. We often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us. Our estimates of expenses in future periods may be under- or over-accrued.
Liabilities Related to Sale of Future Royalties
We treat the liabilities related to sale of future royalties as debt financings, amortized under the effective interest rate method over the estimated life of the related royalty streams. The liabilities related to sale of future royalties and the debt amortization are based on our current estimates of future royalties expected to be paid over the life of the arrangements. We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments using projections from external sources. To the extent our estimates of future royalty payments are greater or less than previous estimates or the estimated timing of such payments is materially different than previous estimates, we will adjust the effective interest rate and recognize related non-cash interest expense on a prospective basis. Non-cash royalty revenue is reflected as royalty revenue, and non-cash amortization of debt is reflected as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, in thousands, together with the change in each item as a percentage.
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $1.9 million in royalty revenue, an increase of 8% as compared to $1.7 million in royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Royalty revenue for both periods is related to royalties on net sales of duvelisib from Verastem and Secura Bio. A portion of the royalties received is owed to Mundipharma and Purdue. We refer to such portion as the Trailing Mundipharma Royalties (see Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We and HCR entered into a purchase and sale agreement in March 2019, or the HCR Agreement, pursuant to which HCR acquired our interest in royalties received from Verastem and Secura Bio on net sales of duvelisib, less the Trailing Mundipharma Royalties (see Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses represented approximately 67% our total operating expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $31.6 million in research and development expense, an increase of approximately 18% as compared to $26.8 million in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in clinical and development expenses for eganelisib of $2.4 million, an increase in compensation expense of $1.3 million due primarily to new hires during the year and an increase in consulting expense of $0.7 million to support continued development of eganelisib.
We began to track and accumulate costs by major program starting on January 1, 2006. These expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs, process development and manufacturing, preclinical toxicology studies, clinical trial costs and allocated costs of facilities. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2021, we estimate that we incurred $31.6 million, $26.8 million and $715.0 million of costs, respectively, on our PI3K inhibitor program, including eganelisib and duvelisib.
We expect our research and development expense to vary as a result of our continued clinical development of eganelisib. We do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs, nor represent what any other future drug development programs we initiate may cost. Due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a product candidate and uncertainties related to our cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for eganelisib or any future product candidates we may develop, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring product candidates to market are not available.
Because of the risks inherent in drug development, we cannot reasonably estimate or know:
•the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs;
•the completion dates of these programs; or
•the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence, if at all, from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates.
There is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop any product candidates. These risks include the uncertainty of:
•the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials that we are currently conducting or may commence in the future;
•clinical trial results;
•the cost of establishing clinical supplies of any product candidates;
•the cost and availability of combination and comparator drugs;
•the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our programs under development;
•the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our programs under development;
•the cost and timing of regulatory approvals;
•the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
General and Administrative Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $14.2 million in general and administrative expense, an increase of 14% as compared to approximately $12.4 million in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $0.5 million in professional services expense, and an increase of $0.5 million in consulting expense.
Royalty Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $1.1 million in royalty expense, an increase of 8% as compared to approximately $1.0 million in royalty expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Royalty expense for both periods is related to royalties paid to Mundipharma, Purdue and Takeda on net sales of duvelisib by Secura Bio and Verastem (see Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Investment and Other Income
Investment and other income decreased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily attributable to lower yields on our cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities and changes in the fair value of the warrant liability.
Non-cash Interest Expense
Non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of the sale of future royalties in relation to the HCR Agreement and BVF Funding Agreement, which we recognized as liabilities that are being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement (see Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the sale of future royalties in relation to the HCR Agreement. Over the course of the arrangements, the non-cash interest expense will be affected by the amount and timing of estimated royalty revenue, if any. We reassess the effective interest rate on a quarterly basis and adjust the rate prospectively as needed.
Non-cash Related Party Interest Expense
Non-cash related party interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the sale of future royalties in relation to the BVF Funding Agreement. Effective February 17, 2021, Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P. is no longer considered our related party. As a result, we have reclassed the related interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as non-cash interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have primarily incurred operating losses since inception. Our net loss was $45.3 million and $40.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $811.6 million. As we have no approved products, we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the foreseeable future, if at all. We have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities, sales of future royalties, issuances of debt, interest on investments, up-front license fees, expense reimbursements, milestones, royalties and cost sharing under our collaborations to fund our operations. Because eganelisib is in clinical development and the outcome of our effort is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of eganelisib or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability.
We expect to continue to spend significant resources to fund the development and potential commercialization of eganelisib. We expect to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years as our clinical trial and drug manufacturing activities increase. In addition, in connection with seeking and possibly obtaining regulatory approval of eganelisib or any future product candidates we may develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As a result, we expect that our accumulated deficit will also increase significantly.
The following table summarizes the components of our financial condition:
Cash Flows
The principal use of cash in operating activities in all periods presented was related to our research and development programs. Our cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to increased operating expenses as we continue clinical development of eganelisib.
Our cash used in operating activities in future periods may vary significantly due to various factors, including potential cash inflows from future collaboration agreements and potential cash outflows for licensing new programs from third parties. We cannot be certain whether and when we may enter into any such collaboration agreements or license agreements.
Our cash provided by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included purchases and proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities and purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to net proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities of $5.5 million as compared to net proceeds from maturities and purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $85.8 million in net proceeds from our public offering in February 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $19.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of future royalties in relation to the BVF Funding Agreement and net proceeds from our common stock sales facility of $7.7 million.
We will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 will be adequate to satisfy our current operating plans for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates. Until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from operations, and because sufficient funds may not be available to us when needed from collaborations, we expect that we will be required to continue to fund our operations in part through the sale of debt or equity securities or through licensing select programs or partial economic rights that include up-front, royalty and/or milestone payments. Our need to raise additional funds may be accelerated if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations, if we acquire a third party, or if we acquire or license rights to additional product candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties. Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of developing eganelisib, currently in clinical development;
•the impact of delays in patient enrollment and site activation, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for eganelisib;
•subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of eganelisib;
•the timing and amount of additional revenues, if any, received from strategic agreements and funding arrangements
•the timing and amount of additional royalty and milestone payments owed to Takeda;
•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;
•any breach, acceleration event or event of default under any agreements with third parties;
•the outcome of any lawsuits that could be brought against us;
•the cost of acquiring raw materials for, and of manufacturing, eganelisib is higher than anticipated;
•the cost or quantity required of comparator or combination drugs used in clinical studies increases;
•the effect of competing technological and market developments;
•any federal government shutdown that prevents or delays the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, from processing any future registration statements we may file to register shares for capital raising purposes; and
•a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons.
Historically, we have relied on our collaborations for a significant portion of our research and development funding needs through upfront payments, milestones, royalties, and cost reimbursements.
As of December 31, 2021, we have received $348.0 million of net proceeds from our public stock offerings, including our common stock sales facility. This includes net proceeds of $85.8 million we received from our public stock offering in February 2021.
We may continue to seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity and/or debt securities, but such financings may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock, and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt.
We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties, or through project financing. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs or to scale back, suspend or terminate our business operations.
Equity Offerings
On June 28, 2019, we entered into a Capital on Demand Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, or JonesTrading, and on July 29, 2019 we amended and restated the sales agreement to add B. Riley FBR, Inc., or B. Riley FBR, as a party to the agreement. On July 27, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the agreement to increase the maximum aggregate offering price of the shares of common stock that we may issue and sell from time to time under the agreement by $75.0 million to an aggregate of $95.0 million. We refer to the amended and restated sales agreement, as amended, as the ATM Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $86.8 million available for future sales under the ATM Sales Agreement. Pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through JonesTrading or B. Riley FBR, each acting as our sales agent. We have agreed to pay commissions to the sales agents for their services in acting as agents in the sale of our common stock in the amount of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement. Sales of shares of our common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement may be made in sales deemed to be “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. With our prior written approval, JonesTrading or B. Riley FBR may also sell the shares by any other method permitted by law, including in negotiated transactions. We and JonesTrading or B. Riley FBR may suspend or terminate the offering of shares upon notice to the other party and subject to other conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold 89,520 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $3.83 at-the-market pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement for $0.3 million in net proceeds. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold 6,725,691 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $1.17 at-the-market pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement for $7.7 million in net proceeds.
On February 11, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement with Piper Sandler & Co., as representative of the underwriters named therein, pursuant to which we issued and sold to the underwriters in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 24,150,000 shares of our common stock, including 3,150,000 shares of common stock sold in connection with the exercise in full of a 15% over-allotment option by the underwriters. The public offering price was $3.80 per share. The gross proceeds to us from this offering were approximately $91.8 million. After underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $85.8 million.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception.
