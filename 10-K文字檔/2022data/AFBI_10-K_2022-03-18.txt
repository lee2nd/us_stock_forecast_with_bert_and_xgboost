ITEM 7.	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements, which appear elsewhere in this annual report. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the other business and financial information provided in this annual report.
Overview
Total assets decreased $62.5 million, or 7.4%, to $788.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $850.6 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $66.5 million, or 37.3%, due to our no longer using the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) for funding as well as the return of excess cash from our oversubscribed January 2021 stock offering, and a decrease in net loans of $16.4 million, or 2.8%, in 2021.
Net income increased $4.5 million, or 145.2%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $2.1 million, or 43.6%, due to the continued low interest rate environment, and an increase in interest income on loans of $1.6 million, or 5.2%. Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased $4.1 million, or 16.4%. The provision for loan losses decreased $925,000 to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Noninterest income increased $522,000, or 24.3%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increases in service charges on deposits accounts, interchange income, and secondary market fee income. Noninterest expenses decreased $450,000, or 2.1%, to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of decreases in legal and accounting fees and salary and employee expense, which were higher in 2020 due to the merger. Income tax expense increased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of increased income before income taxes.
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to raise market interest rates in 2022. A rise in interest rates will present us with a slight challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income as interest rates rise. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. As described in “-Management of Market Risk,” our net interest income and our net economic value would decrease as a result of an instantaneous increase in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products, we continue to diversify our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans, and we proactively manage the liability-side of the balance sheet by adjusting rates offered on our interest-bearing accounts and reviewing long-term funding options to help minimize the compression on our net interest margin. See “-Management of Market Risk.”

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We determined to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following represent our significant accounting policies:
Business Combinations and Valuation of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations. We account for acquisitions under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. As provided for under U.S. GAAP, management has up to 12 months following the date of the acquisition to finalize the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, where it is not possible to estimate the acquisition date fair value upon consummation.
In particular, the valuation of acquired loans involves significant estimates, assumptions and judgment based on information available as of the acquisition date. Substantially all loans acquired in the transaction are evaluated in pools of loans with similar characteristics; and since the estimated fair value of acquired loans includes a credit consideration, no carryover of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses is recorded at acquisition. A number of factors are considered in determining the estimated fair value of purchased loans including, among other things, the remaining life of the acquired loans, estimated prepayments, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, estimated holding periods, contractual interest rates compared to market interest rates, and net present value of cash flows expected to be received.
In determining the Day 1 Fair Values of acquired loans, which are the fair value on all acquired loans at the time of the acquisition, management calculates a nonaccretable difference (the credit mark component of the acquired loans) and an accretable difference (the market rate or yield component of the acquired loans). The nonaccretable difference is the difference between the undiscounted contractually required payments and the undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected in accordance with management’s determination of the Day 1 Fair Values. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows will result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and then an adjustment to accretable yield, and nonaccretable difference which would have a positive impact on interest income.
The accretable yield on acquired loans is the difference between the expected cash flows and the initial investment in the acquired loans. The accretable yield is recognized into earnings using the effective yield method over the term of the loans. Management separately monitors the acquired loan portfolio and periodically reviews loans contained within this portfolio against the factors and assumptions used in determining the Day 1 Fair Values.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. Loans are charged off when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management’s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment. The evaluation process involves gathering and interpreting many qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses. Because interpretation and analysis involves judgment, current economic or business conditions can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses could change significantly.
The allocation methodology applied by Affinity Bank is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and includes allocations for specifically identified impaired loans and loss factor allocations for all remaining loans, with a component primarily based on historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors. The methodology includes evaluation and consideration of several factors, such as, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. While management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or circumstances underlying the collectability of loans. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. Management believes the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The allowance analysis is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses. As a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process of establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is the responsibility of Affinity Bank and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.
Income Taxes. The assessment of income tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretation, and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management’s current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the results of operations and reported earnings.
The Company files a consolidated federal and a state income tax return. Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax law rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income tax expense. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that a portion of the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The Company may also recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured in the consolidated financial statements. Penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.
Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak
Beginning in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected economic activity in our markets. In response to the pandemic, state and local governments have from time to time imposed restrictions on individual and business activities. These and other measures increased unemployment in the United States and negatively impacted many businesses, and thereby threatened the repayment ability of some of our borrowers. During 2021, global financial markets continued to experience volatility resulting from the spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of new variants.
To address the economic impact in the United States, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act included a number of provisions that affected us, including accounting relief for troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). The CARES Act also established the PPP through the SBA, which allowed us to lend money to small businesses to maintain employee payrolls through the crisis with guarantees from the SBA. Under this program, loan amounts may be forgiven if the borrower maintains employee payrolls and meet certain other requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received SBA authorization for 1,171 PPP loans totaling $130.3 million. We had $101.7 million in PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received SBA authorization for 730 PPP loans totaling $66.1 million. We had $17.9 million in PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
In addition, beginning in 2020, the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster the economy by, among other things, reducing the federal funds rate and the discount-window borrowing rate to near zero. Interest rates remained low in 2021. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to increase interest rates in 2022.
In response to the pandemic, we have implemented protocols and processes to help protect our employees, customers and communities. These measures include:
•Operating our branches under a drive-through model with appointment-only lobby service for a period of time, leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities that include critical operations teams being divided and dispersed to separate locations and, when possible, having employees work from home.
•Offering assistance to our customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes payment deferrals, waiving certain fees, suspending property foreclosures, and participating in the CARES Act and lending programs for businesses, including the PPP.
We implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide our borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the CARES Act, which expired on January 1, 2022, COVID-19 related modifications to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 were exempt from TDR classification under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., nine months or less) granted for loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we granted short-term deferrals on 737 loans totaling $186.9 million that were otherwise performing. As of December 31, 2020, all of these loans had returned to normal payment status. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we granted short-term deferrals on seven loans totaling $2.7 million that were otherwise performing. As of December 31, 2021, all but one of these loans had returned to normal payment status. That one loan is currently in nonaccrual status.
Given the uncertainty and evolving economic effects and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain. Adverse economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which could include, but not be limited to, decreased demand for our products and services, protracted periods of lower interest rates, increased noninterest expenses, including operational losses, and increased credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, including declining asset and collateral values, which may continue to increase our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Total assets decreased $62.5 million, or 7.4%, to $788.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $850.6 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $66.5 million, or 37.3%, due to our no longer using the PPPLF for funding as well as the return of excess cash from our oversubscribed January 2021 stock offering, and a decrease in net loans of $16.4 million, or 2.8%, in 2021.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $66.5 million, or 37.3%, to $111.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $178.3 million at December 31, 2020, as the PPPLF was not used for funding during 2021 and excess cash from our oversubscribed January 2021 stock offering was returned to subscribers.
Loans decreased $16.4 million, or 2.8%, to $575.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $592.3 million at December 31, 2020. Commercial and industrial loans, excluding PPP loans, decreased $2.7 million, or 1.7%, to $152.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $155.6 million at December 31, 2020. PPP loans decreased $83.9 million, or 82.4%, to $17.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $101.7 million at December 31, 2020, as a result of forgiveness of loans by the SBA. Construction loans decreased $7.3 million, or 30.8%, to $16.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $23.6 million at December 31, 2020, as construction loans transitioned to permanent loans and new construction loans were not fully drawn. One- to four-family residential real estate loans decreased $28.7 million, or 31.3%, to $63.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $91.8 million at December 31, 2020, as mortgage loans continue to be refinanced at lower rates than we offer. These decreases were partially offset by increases in commercial real estate loans of $84.1 million, or 47.1%, to $262.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $178.6 million at December 31, 2020, and in consumer loans of $24.2 million, or 51.0%, to $71.6 million at December 31, 2021 from $47.4 million at December 31, 2020. Our January 2020 acquisition of ABB Financial and Affinity Bank shifted the composition of the loan portfolio towards increased commercial and industrial lending and commercial real estate lending, and away from one- to four-family mortgage lending.
Securities available-for-sale increased to $48.6 million at December 31, 2021, from $24.0 million at December 31, 2020, due to our using excess cash from loan repayments and prepayments to invest in securities.
Total deposits decreased $25.4 million, or 4.0%, to $614.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $640.2 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in total deposits included decreases of $38.4 million, or 29.6%, in interest-bearing checking accounts, as we completed our second step conversion and stock offering in January 2021 and subscriptions for our common stock were either fulfilled or returned; $34.9 million, or 26.5%, in certificates of deposit, as a decreasing interest rate environment resulted in customers keeping funds in more liquid deposits; and $9.8 million, or 10.2%, in savings accounts. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $33.1 million, or 20.6%, in noninterest-bearing checking accounts and $24.7 million, 20.3%, in market rate checking accounts. The loan-to-deposit ratio at December 31, 2021 was 95.1%, as compared to 93.5% at December 31, 2020.
We had $49.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2021, compared to $19.1 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, $100.8 million in PPPLF funds, and $5.0 million of other borrowings at December 31, 2020. In January 2021, we repaid PPPLF borrowings that we had obtained to fund first-round PPP loans. We increased FHLB borrowings during 2021 to benefit from low interest rates and address the uncertainty of current liquidity levels as a result of the second round of PPP loans.
Stockholders’ equity increased $40.2 million or 49.7%, to $121.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $80.8 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to the completion of our stock offering in January 2021. We sold 3,701,509 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share and raised gross proceeds of $37.1 million in the offering.
Average Balance Sheets
The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. All average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Interest on loans includes the following fees: PPP loan fees of $5.0 million and $3.2 million for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; loan origination fees of $1.0 million and $635,000 for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; net accretion of purchased loan marks of $437,000 and $554,000 for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively;
prepayment penalties of $79,000 and $54,000 for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; and indirect auto fees of $228,000 and $151,000 for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(1)Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.
(2)Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been
allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. No out-of-period item adjustments have been included in the following table.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General. Net income increased $4.5 million, or 145.2%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $2.1 million, or 43.6%, due to the continued low interest rate environment, and an increase in interest income on loans of $1.6 million, or 5.2%, as well as a decrease in the provision for loan losses, an increase in noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expenses.
Interest Income. Interest income increased $1.8 million, or 5.9%, to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to a $1.6 million, or 5.2%, increase in interest income on loans, which included $5.8 million of interest and fee income on PPP loans. Our average balance of loans, including PPP loans, increased $13.4 million, or 2.3%, to $589.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $575.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average yield on loans increased 15 basis points to 5.35% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 5.20% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest income on securities (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank stock) increased $329,000 to $709,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $380,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average balance of securities increased $15.2 million, or 76.3%, to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to our using excess cash from loan repayments and prepayments to invest in securities. The average rate earned on securities increased 11 basis points during 2021, to 2.02% from 1.91%.
Interest income on interest-earning deposits decreased $32,000, or 15.1%, to $180,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $212,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest income on interest-earning deposits was due to a 13 basis point decrease in yield, while the average balance of interest-earning deposits increased $29.4 million, or 42.5%, to $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as excess funds have been deployed into securities and loans.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $2.3 million, or 42.1%, to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to decreases of $2.1 million in interest expense on deposits and $241,000 in interest expense on borrowings. Interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased by $1.0 million, or 38.1%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in expense on certificates of deposit was the result of a $43.3 million decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit during the year ended December 31, 2021 and a 23 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit, as we have lowered rates. Interest expense on market rate checking accounts decreased $496,000, to $469,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average balance of market rate checking accounts increased by $21.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, while the average rate we paid on market rate checking accounts decreased by 51 basis points. Interest expense on statement savings accounts decreased by $475,000, to $403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $878,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average balance of statement savings accounts increased by $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, while the average rate we paid on statement savings accounts decreased by 56 basis points. Interest expense on interest-bearing checking accounts decreased by $101,000, to $185,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $286,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased by $18.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, while the average rate we paid on interest-bearing checking accounts decreased by 19 basis points. The decreases in interest expense on market rate checking accounts, statement savings accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts were primarily due to continued decreases in market rates, and were partially offset by increases in the average balances of such accounts.
Interest expense on borrowings decreased to $497,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $738,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as the average balance of borrowings decreased to $44.8 million for 2021 from $73.1 million for 2020, primarily due to the repayment of PPPLF borrowings in January 2021.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by $4.1 million, or 16.4%, to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average net interest-earning assets increased by $85.6 million, or 50.9%, to $253.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $168.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, while our net interest rate spread increased by 32 basis points to 3.81% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting a 43 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earnings assets during 2021. Our net interest margin was 4.04% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Provision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See “-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information.
After an evaluation of these factors, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher provision in 2020 related primarily to the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic uncertainty. Our allowance for loan losses was $8.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $6.4 million at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.46% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.06% at December 31, 2020, while the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 122.09% at December 31, 2021 compared to 129.79% at December 31, 2020. We had charge-offs of $310,000 and recoveries of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2021. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process of establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.
We expect to adopt a new accounting standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”), effective January 1, 2023. CECL requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change our current method of recording allowances for loan losses
that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and to increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $522,000, or 24.2%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted primarily from increases in other noninterest income of $395,000, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $777,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as interchange income and secondary market fee income increased. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts increased $147,000, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Noninterest Expenses. Noninterest expenses information is as follows.
Noninterest expenses decreased $450,000, or 2.1%, to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Legal and accounting, salaries and employee benefits, and data processing expenses decreased in 2021 as we incurred higher expenses in 2020 related to our acquisition of ABB and Affinity Bank. Partially offsetting these decreases, other noninterest expenses increased by $1.4 million due to writedown of premises and equipment and occupancy expense, due to facilities consolidation.
Income Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $792,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in income tax expense was due to increased income before income taxes in the 2021 period.
Management of Market Risk
General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.
We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:
•limiting our reliance on non-core/wholesale funding sources;
•growing our volume of transaction deposit accounts;
•increasing our investment securities portfolio, with an average maturity of less than 15 years;
•diversifying our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans, which typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments; and
•continuing to price our one- to four-family residential real estate loan products in a way that encourages borrowers to select our adjustable rate loans as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate loans.
By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates.
We do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.
Net Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 200 and 400 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the “Change in Interest Rates” column below.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.
(1)Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 2.38% increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 3.23% decrease in net interest income. At December 31, 2020, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 1.09% increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced an 3.16% decrease in net interest income.
Net Economic Value. We also compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (net economic value or “NEV”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 200 and 400 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021, the calculation of the estimated changes in our NEV that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.
(1)Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
(2)NEV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.
(3)Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.
(4)NEV Ratio represents NEV divided by the present value of assets.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 5.16% decrease in net economic value, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 2.92% decrease in net economic value. At December 31, 2020, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 3.89% decrease in net economic value, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 3.34% decrease in net economic value.
GAP Analysis. In addition, we analyze our interest rate sensitivity by monitoring our interest rate sensitivity “gap.” Our interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of our interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of our interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period.
The following table sets forth our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2021, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans. Amounts are based on a preliminary balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, and may not equal amounts included in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. However, we believe that there would be no material changes in the results of the gap analysis if audited financial results had been utilized.
(1)	Gap/assets ratio equals the asset/liability gap for the period divided by total assets ($788.1 million).
At December 31, 2021, our asset/liability gap from zero days to one year was $2.5 million, resulting in a gap/assets ratio of .31%.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and net economic value tables presented assume that the composition of
our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and NEV tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and NEV and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table.
Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At December 31, 2021, we had a $44.7 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and had $49.0 million in borrowings and an $8.0 million letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2021, used to collateralize public deposits. In addition, at December 31, 2021, we had a $5.0 million unsecured federal funds line of credit and a $7.5 million unsecured federal funds line of credit. No amount was outstanding on these lines of credit at December 31, 2021. We also have a line of $62.0 million with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Discount Window secured by $115.2 million in loans. No amount was outstanding on the Discount Window at December 31, 2021.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $11.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was $9.6 million and $110.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities typically consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and purchases of investment securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities and paydowns on securities, but also included $22.7 million net cash disbursed in connection with our acquisition of ABB and Affinity Bank during 2020. Net cash used in financing activities, which consists primarily of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from or repayments of borrowings, was $68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $239.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.
At December 31, 2021, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements, and we were categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $69.6 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 totaled $48.6 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.
Future Accounting Pronouncements
Please refer to Note 1 to the financial statements included as Item 8 in this Annual Report for a description of future accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Price
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
