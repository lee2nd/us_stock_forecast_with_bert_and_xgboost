Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Management’s Focus
For the year ended December 31, 2021, management’s focus was on:
•continued preservation and enhancement of our liquidity and cost reduction in light of the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•revenue growth and diversification;
•integrating the Belfast, Morocco and Dallas sites;
•repaying and/or restructuring debt; and
•operational execution, with a continuing focus on safety and quality.
For the year ending December 31, 2022, management’s focus is on:
•continued management of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•internal and external rate readiness preparedness;
•growth, diversification, and operational execution; and
•safety and quality in the key markets that we serve.
Change to Organizational Structure
On September 30, 2021, we announced a new organizational structure to focus on growth in the key markets that we serve. Under the new structure, we have three primary segments: Commercial, Defense & Space, and Aftermarket. The new organizational structure and leadership changes to support the new structure became effective October 1, 2021. Our financial performance within this report is based on the new organizational structure for all periods presented. Prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the new segment presentation. The new segment structure has no impact on our historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
COVID-19
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative effect on aviation demand, the aviation industry, our customers, our suppliers, and our business globally, which is expected to continue. Our financial results and prospects are largely connected to global aviation demand and the resulting production rates of our customers. In response to COVID-19 impacts, our customers, including Boeing and Airbus, decreased production rates across many programs and may further adjust production rates in the future. A description of Airbus and Boeing's production rates on our significant programs is included below.
Although the aviation industry showed signs of improvement and recovery during the year ended December 31, 2021, the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the aviation industry and our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of our control. Distribution and administration of vaccines generally continued to progress during the period, and travel advisories and restrictions generally eased; however, due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current conditions around the world (including with respect to the Delta and Omicron variants), we are unable to predict accurately the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business going forward. For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Our expectation is that our business operations will not improve until our customers are willing to produce aircraft at sufficient levels, which is dependent upon the public's willingness to use aircraft travel, sufficient OEM orders (without suspension) from airlines, and the financial resources of airlines, other companies, and individuals.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Department of Transportation approved our grant claim of $75.5 million filed under the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program, a component of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we have received $37.8 million of the total amount approved with the remainder to be received through the period of the agreement, which expires in March 2022.
On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced new vaccination requirements applicable to federal workers and contractors, large employers and healthcare workers. Subject to limited exceptions, U.S. employees of federal contractors were required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by January 4, 2022. As a federal contactor, we are subject to the executive order and implemented mandatory vaccination rules for all U.S. employees to satisfy the requirements. On December 7, 2021, a federal judge in Georgia issued a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from enforcing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors and subcontractors. As a result, we suspended the January 4th vaccine deadline for compliance with the mandate. If the requirements, or similar requirements, are reinstated, our implementation of these rules may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
B737 Program
In March 2019, the B737 MAX fleet was grounded in the U.S. and internationally following the 2018 and 2019 accidents involving two B737 MAX aircraft. On November 18, 2020, the FAA issued an order rescinding the grounding of the B737 MAX and published an Airworthiness Directive specifying design changes to be made before the aircraft returned to service. Boeing's deliveries of the B737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020. Since November 2020, regulators from Brazil, Canada, the EU, U.K., India, and other countries have taken similar actions to unground the B737 MAX and permit return to service. The Civil Aviation Administration of China, which is the most significant country remaining to allow the B737 MAX to return to service, issued an airworthiness directive in December 2021, directing corrective actions necessary to allow for return to service. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Boeing continued to receive orders for the B737 MAX, and several additional air carriers resumed flights on the aircraft.
The B737 MAX program is a critical program to the Company. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately 35%, 19%, and 53% of our net revenues, respectively, were generated from sales of components to Boeing for the B737 aircraft. While we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to continue to provide components for the B737 for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial and military P-8 derivatives, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any replacement for the B737 that is not a commercial derivative model as defined by the Special Business Provisions and the General Terms Agreement (collectively, the “Sustaining Agreement”) between Spirit and Boeing. The Sustaining Agreement is a requirements contract and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time.
We expect that ongoing demand challenges from the B737 MAX grounding will continue to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic because other programs that mitigate the strain of the lower B737 MAX production rate continue to be suspended or are producing at lower rates. We expect air travel demand will continue to improve from 2021 levels as COVID-19 vaccinations are administered globally. The overall pace of any recovery of air travel demand will depend on availability, speed and acceptance of vaccinations, the speed of continued COVID-19 mutations, effectiveness of vaccines on new strains of the COVID-19 virus, government travel restrictions and availability and speed of test results. We expect that domestic air travel demand will continue to improve in the near term with international air travel demand continuing to lag behind. As a result, we expect that the B737 MAX and other narrowbody production rates will recover to pre-pandemic levels before widebody production rates. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
B787 Program
In the year ended December 31, 2020, Boeing announced B787 production rate changes from 10 aircraft per month to 5 aircraft per month. This resulted in an incremental forward loss charge of $192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, as Boeing was reviewing its B787 Dreamliner production system, we began analyzing our own B787 production system. Our results for the first quarter of 2021 included an initial assessment regarding the rework required and included an associated estimated loss of $29.3 million. During the second quarter of 2021, we continued to evaluate and refine our estimate of costs related to engineering changes and rework based upon additional information received from Boeing, and further refined the areas of the B787 which could require rework in the forward section, including our assessment of costs. As a result of our further assessment, we recorded an incremental forward loss charge of $46.4 million for the second quarter of 2021. Based on our assessment of the B787 program demand received from Boeing in September 2021, we incurred an incremental forward loss of $45.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, principally driven by the impact of
reduced production volumes and the corresponding amount of fixed overhead absorption applied to lower deliveries. In the fourth quarter of 2021, further reductions to planned production volumes received from our customer resulted in an incremental forward loss of $32.3 million.
Changes to the scope of quality issues and any associated rework may increase or decrease the total estimated provision as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, production rate changes, changes in cost assessments, or claims could result in additional incremental forward loss charges. See also Note 22, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.
Airbus Programs
All Airbus programs have experienced production rate reductions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic impact to both international and global travel.
As a result of customer driven production rate changes, and quality-related costs, the A350 program recorded forward loss charges of $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The A220 wing and mid-fuselage sections acquired from Bombardier had forward loss liabilities of approximately $320 million in the opening balance sheet as a result of the application of ASC 805 Business Combinations, see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions.
Bombardier Acquisition
On October 30, 2020, Spirit and Spirit AeroSystems Global Holdings Limited (“Spirit UK”), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, completed their previously announced acquisition of the outstanding equity of Shorts and Bombardier Aerospace North Africa SAS ("BANA"), and substantially all the assets of the maintenance, repair and overhaul business in Dallas, Texas (collectively, the “Bombardier Acquired Business”), along with the assumption of certain liabilities of Shorts and BANA (the “Bombardier Acquisition”). For further information, see Note 28 Acquisitions. Our integration activities on the Bombardier Acquisition are largely complete as of December 31, 2021.
The Company, acting through certain of its subsidiaries, assumed certain liabilities of the acquired entities, including the net pension liabilities under the Shorts Pension scheme and Short’s obligations under a repayable investment agreement with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy of the U.K. Government. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Shorts Pension was amended and was closed to the future accrual of benefits for all employees who were members of the plan, effective December 10, 2021. From December 11, 2021, affected employees will build up future retirement savings in a new defined contribution scheme. The impact of the closure of the Shorts Pension resulted in a curtailment gain of $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. On October 30, 2021, Shorts paid a special contribution of £100 million to the Shorts Pension scheme. See Note 17, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits for more information. The A220 wing and mid-fuselage sections acquired from Bombardier had forward loss liability of approximately $320 million in the opening balance sheet as a result of the application of ASC 805 Business Combinations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) requires management to use estimates and assumptions. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the impacts of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory, revenue, income taxes, financing obligations, warranties, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical accounting policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions, and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe application of these policies requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments to estimate the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Revenues and Profit Recognition
Revenue is recognized using the principles of ASC 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services transfers to a customer, and the amount recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a further description of revenue recognition under ASC 606. In determining our profits and losses in accordance with this method, we are required to make significant judgments regarding our future costs, variable elements of revenue, the standalone selling price, and other variables. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience. If we make material changes to our assumptions, we may have positive or negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized, and in some cases, we may adjust forward loss reserves. When we experience abnormal production costs such as excess capacity costs the Company expenses the excess costs in the period incurred and reports as segment costs of goods sold. These excess costs (actual and estimated future costs) are excluded from the estimates at completion of our accounting contracts with customers. For a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new and maturing programs, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
We account for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured and recognized based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, any excess of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For material acquisitions, we have engaged independent advisory consultants to assist us with determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill, and liabilities assumed based on established business valuation methodologies. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, the Company used discounted cash flow analyses, which were based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Use of different estimates and judgments could yield materially different results. If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs, the business combination is recorded and disclosed on a preliminary basis. Subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the initial preliminary recognized amounts are recorded to the extent new information is obtained about the measurement of assets and liabilities that existed as of the date of the acquisition.
The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill may be lower than its carrying value. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test at the reporting unit level. In performing a qualitative assessment, we evaluate company-specific, market and industry, economic, and other relevant factors that may impact the fair value of our reporting units or the carrying value of the net assets of the respective reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the respective reporting unit, then a quantitative test is performed. Where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
In accordance with our annual assessment policy, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter based on the goodwill balances that existed as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, the balance of goodwill was $623.6 million. Goodwill primarily represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of Fiber Materials Inc. ("FMI") in the first quarter of 2020 and the completion of the acquisition of the outstanding equity of Short Brothers plc (“Shorts”) and Bombardier Aerospace North Africa SAS ("BANA"), and substantially all the assets of the maintenance, repair and overhaul business in Dallas, Texas (collectively, the “Bombardier Acquired Businesses”), along with the assumption of certain liabilities of Shorts and BANA (the “Bombardier Acquisition”) in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the acquisition of the assets of Applied Aerodynamics, Inc. ("Applied") during the three months ended July 1, 2021. Management concluded through the assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the respective carrying value, and therefore, the Company's goodwill was not impaired. The variability of the factors used in our assessment depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the impacts of the pandemic could result in an impairment of our goodwill. Our current estimates reflect potential production rate reduction scenarios for our primary customers that are not permanent in nature as we assume there will be an economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global passenger levels will ultimately return to pre-COVID-19 levels.
Pension
Many of our employees have earned benefits under the defined benefit pension plans. Effective June 17, 2005, pension assets and liabilities were spun-off from three Boeing qualified plans into four qualified Spirit plans for each Spirit employee who did not retire from Boeing by August 1, 2005. Effective December 31, 2005, all four qualified plans were merged together. In addition, Spirit has one nonqualified plan providing supplemental benefits to executives who transferred from a Boeing nonqualified plan to a Spirit plan and elected to keep their benefits in this plan. Both plans are frozen as of the date of the Boeing Acquisition (i.e., no future service benefits are being earned in these plans). The Company intends to fund its qualified pension plan through a trust. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the pension plans’ participants and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations. Effective October 1, 2021, the Company spun off a portion of the existing Pension Value Plan ("PVP A"), called PVP B. As part of the plan termination process, a lump sum offering was provided during 2021 for PVP B participants and the final asset distribution is expected in the first quarter of 2022.
On April 1, 2006, as part of the acquisition of BAE Aerostructures, the Company established a U.K. defined benefit pension plan for those employees based in Prestwick that had pension benefits remaining in BAE Systems’ pension plan. Effective December 31, 2013, this Prestwick pension plan was closed and benefits were frozen and thereafter subject only to statutory pension revaluation.
On October 30, 2020, as part of the Bombardier Acquisition, the Company acquired two further defined benefit plans for current and former employees at the Belfast location. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had concluded its consultation and communication with employee and Trade Union representatives on the closure of the largest of the defined benefit plans acquired as part of the Bombardier Acquisition, the Shorts Pension (as defined below). The outcome is that the Shorts Pension was amended and closed to the future accrual of benefits for all employees who are members of the plan, effective December 10, 2021. From December 11, 2021, affected employees will build up future retirement savings in a new defined contribution scheme. For the for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the impact of the closure of the Shorts Pension resulted in a curtailment gain of $61.0 million. The remaining plan is closed to new hires and the future accrual of benefits, as the final employees accruing service in the plan left Company employment. In accordance with the agreement reached as part of the Bombardier Acquisition, the Company made contributions of $154.7 million to improve the funded status of the Belfast defined benefit plans during 2021, which included a one-time special contribution of $137.6 million to the Shorts Pension plan during October 2021. Contributions in respect of the accrual of benefits up to December 10, 2021 and other costs were paid in addition. See Note 17, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits for more information. In accordance with legislation, each of the U.K. plans and their assets are managed by independent trustee companies.
Accounting guidance requires an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and shareholders’ equity.
The projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost are sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $163.4 million or increase by $173.9 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. The 2021 net periodic pension cost would increase by $5.6 million or decrease by $6.3 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points at each applicable measurement date. Additionally, net periodic pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2021 net periodic pension cost by $10.1 million.
For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors". We could be required to make future contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets. Adverse changes in the securities markets or interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory actions could substantially increase the costs of these plans and could result in a requirement to contribute additional funds to the plans.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs.
Deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When
determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, we assess all available positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.
This assessment is completed on a taxing jurisdiction and entity filing basis. Based on these criteria and the relative weighting of both the positive and negative evidence available, and in particular the activity surrounding the Company’s prior earnings history including the forward losses previously recognized in the U.S. and U.K., management determined that it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against nearly all of its net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020. This determination was made as the Company entered into a U.S. cumulative loss position during the first half of 2021, as prior period positive earnings fall outside of the three-year measurement period. Additionally, entities of the U.K. operations are in cumulative loss positions after the inclusion of 2020 and 2021 losses and the Company anticipates U.K. entities will be in cumulative loss positions during the first half of 2022.
We record income tax provision or benefit based on the pre-tax income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. The final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management's original estimates made in determining the income tax provision. A change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods. We use the flow-through accounting method for tax credits. Under this method, tax credits reduce income tax expense. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes, for further discussion.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain of our operating data:
_______________________________________
(1)See “Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020” for detailed discussion of operating data.
(2)See “Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019” for detailed discussion of operating data.
Comparative shipset deliveries by model are as follows:
_______________________________________
(1)Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, total business/regional jet deliveries includes deliveries related to the Bombardier Acquisition.
For purposes of measuring production or shipset deliveries for Boeing aircraft in a given period, the term “shipset” refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. For purposes of measuring production or shipset deliveries for Airbus and business and regional jet aircraft in a given period, the term “shipset” refers to all structural aircraft components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. For the purposes of measuring wing shipset deliveries, the term “shipset” refers to all wing components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. Other components that are part of the same aircraft shipsets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used to measure production or shipset deliveries, which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various shipset components in any given period.
Net revenues by prime customer are as follows:
Changes in Estimates
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized unfavorable change in estimates of $246.5 million primarily driven by the impact of reduced production volumes on the B787 and A350 programs and the corresponding amount of fixed overhead absorption applied to lower deliveries, engineering analysis and estimated costs of rework on the B787 program, estimated quality improvement costs on the A350 program, and cost performance on the B767 program. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recognized unfavorable change in estimates of $400.7 million primarily driven by production rate changes on the B787 program from 10 aircraft per month to 5 aircraft per month, production rate changes on the A350 program from 9 aircraft per month to 4 aircraft per month, and rate reductions across all programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recognized unfavorable changes in estimates of $65.5 million primarily driven by production rate change on the B787 program from 14 aircraft per month to 10 aircraft per month.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020
Net Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $3,953.0 million, an increase of $548.2 million, or 16.1%, compared with net revenues of $3,404.8 million, for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased production volumes on the B737 MAX program, incremental revenues from our A220 wing and Bombardier programs, which were acquired late in 2020, and increased aftermarket revenues, partially offset by lower production on B777, B787, and A350 programs. Approximately 80% of the Company's net revenues in 2021 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.
Deliveries to Boeing increased to 262 shipsets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 256 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by production increases on the B737 program, partially offset by lower shipset deliveries on the B777 and B787 programs. Deliveries to Airbus decreased to 585 shipsets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 591 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher A220 deliveries that were more than offset by lower production volumes on the A350 program. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components increased to 181 shipsets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 73 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by incremental work statement acquired with the Bombardier Acquisition in late 2020.
Gross (Loss) Profit. Gross (loss) profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was ($117.8) million, as compared to ($440.7) million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease in loss of $322.9 million. The improvement in gross loss reflects an increased volume of B737 MAX production, relatively lower forward loss charges on the B787 and A350 programs as compared to the prior year period, lower excess capacity production costs versus the prior period, partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year, and incremental profit from business/regional jet programs that were acquired with the Bombardier Acquisition in late 2020, partially offset by lower margins on the B777 program, increased costs on a non-classified program, and greater warranty expense in the current period.
SG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $42.5 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a charge related to a current year ruling in favor of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer (see Note 22, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) and incremental expenses from our recently acquired Belfast site, which was acquired late in the prior year. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 reflects increased activity and was $14.5 million higher as compared to the same period in the prior year.
Restructuring Costs and Disposal of Assets. Restructuring costs were $64.8 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior year. The variance reflects higher cost-alignment and headcount reduction activity seen in the prior year. The total restructuring costs of $8.2 million in the current year largely include costs related to the McAlester and San Antonio site closures. Losses on disposals of assets were $22.9 million in the prior year, and were related to production decreases, process-related changes and quality improvement initiatives on the B787 and A350 programs.
Operating (Loss) Income. Operating (loss) income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $(459.2) million, an improvement of $353.6 million, compared to operating (loss) income of $(812.8) million for the prior year. The decreased loss was primarily driven by the decreased gross loss on sales and reductions to restructuring costs mentioned above.
Interest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased by $47.3 million as compared to the prior year. Current year interest expense and financing fee amortization included $197.4 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $8.9 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount compared to $160.3 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $17.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue
discount for the prior year. The remaining variance from the comparable prior period is driven by interest expense recognized on the repayable investment agreement with BEIS. See also Note 16, Debt and Note 28, Acquisitions.
Other Income (Expense), net. Other income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $146.6 million, compared to other expense of $77.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The improvement of $224.4 million during 2021 was primarily driven by a net pension loss recognized in the prior year period related to a voluntary retirement program, whereas the current year period includes net pension income, including a curtailment gain recognized related to the closure of the Shorts Pension to future benefit accrual for current and former employees at the Belfast location. In addition, the prior year results included a relatively large foreign currency loss, relative to a small foreign currency gain in the current year.
Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. The income tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was $17.2 million compared to a benefit of $220.2 million for the prior year. The 2021 effective tax rate was 3.1% as compared to 20.3% for 2020. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily related to the valuation allowance recorded on the 2021 domestic net operating loss. The 2020 net operating loss did not have a valuation allowance due to the ability to carryback that net operating loss.
Segments. The following table shows segment revenues and operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
_______________________________________
(1)Inclusive of forward losses, changes in estimate on loss programs and cumulative catch-up adjustments. These changes in estimates for the periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are further detailed in Note 5, Changes in Estimates.
(2)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes excess capacity production costs of $206.7 million related to the temporary B737 MAX and A220 production schedule changes, abnormal costs of $12.0 million for workforce adjustments as a result of COVID-19 production pause, net of U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies, $6.8 million of restructuring costs, and a $35.9 million offset related to partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes excess capacity production costs of $265.5 million related to the temporary B737 MAX and A220 production schedule changes, abnormal costs of $33.7 million for workforce adjustments as a result of COVID-19 production pause, net of U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies, and $64.0 million of restructuring costs.
(3)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes excess capacity production costs of $10.8 million, $1.1 million of restructuring costs, and a $3.0 million offset related to partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes excess capacity production costs of $13.4 million related to the temporary B737 production schedule changes, and $3.8 million of restructuring costs.
(4)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $0.3 million restructuring costs, and a $2.2 million offset to costs related to partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes $5.2 million of restructuring costs.
The Commercial, Defense & Space, and Aftermarket segments represented approximately 79%, 15%, and 6%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The Commercial, Defense & Space, and Aftermarket segments represented approximately 80%, 14%, and 6%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The Commercial, Defense & Space, and Aftermarket segments represented approximately 91%, 7%, and 2%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Commercial Segment. Commercial segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $3,128.1 million, an increase of $416.8 million, or 15.4%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased production volumes on the B737 MAX program and incremental revenues from our A220 wing and Bombardier programs, which were acquired late in 2020, partially offset by lower production on B777, B787, and A350 programs. Commercial segment operating margins were (7%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to (23%) for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross loss reflects an increased volume of B737 MAX production, relatively lower forward loss charges on the B787 and A350 programs as compared to the prior year period, lower excess capacity production costs versus the prior period, partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year, and incremental profit from business/regional jet programs that were acquired with the Bombardier Acquisition in late 2020, partially offset by higher warranty costs in the current year and lower margins on the B777 program related primarily to lower production rates. The year ended December 31, 2021 includes excess capacity production costs of $206.7 million related to the temporary B737 MAX and A220 production schedule changes, abnormal costs of $12.0 million for workforce adjustments as a result of COVID-19 production pause, net of U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies, $6.8 million of restructuring costs, and a $35.9 million offset to costs related to partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes excess capacity production costs of $265.5 million related to the temporary B737 MAX and A220 production schedule changes, abnormal costs of $33.7 million for workforce adjustments as a result of COVID-19 production pause, net of U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies, and $64.0 million of restructuring costs. In 2021, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $5.7 million and $227.3 million of net forward loss charges primarily driven by the impact of reduced production volumes on the B787 and A350 programs and the corresponding amount of fixed overhead absorption applied to lower deliveries, engineering analysis and estimated costs of rework on the B787 program, estimated quality improvement costs on the A350 program, and cost performance on the B767 program. In comparison, during 2020, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $28.9 million related to COVID-19 pandemic related production rate reductions, and $366.8 million of net forward loss charges primarily due to production rate reductions on the B787 and A350 programs.
Defense & Space Segment. Defense & Space segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $585.0 million, an increase of $93.7 million, or 19.1%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased KC-46 Tanker production, increased classified program revenues, and increased production of the Boeing B737 program, the contracts for which include P-8 units that are accounted for in the Defense & Space segment. Defense & Space segment operating margins were 8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 10% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased costs on a non-classified program and a forward loss taken in the current period on the Bell V-280 OTA program. The impact of these cost increases was partially offset by margin improvements related to increased Boeing production and lower excess capacity and restructuring costs. The year ended December 31, 2021 includes excess capacity production costs of $10.8 million, $1.1 million of restructuring costs, and a $3.0 million offset related to partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes excess capacity production costs of $13.4 million related to the temporary B737 production schedule changes, and $3.8 million of restructuring costs. In 2021, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $0.7 million and $14.2 million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2020, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $1.5 million $3.5 million of net forward loss charges.
Aftermarket Segment. Aftermarket segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $239.9 million, an increase of $37.7 million, or 18.6%, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increased MRO revenue from our Belfast, Northern Ireland and Dallas, Texas sites, which were acquired late in the prior period, partially offset by a decrease in spare parts sales from the prior year. Aftermarket segment operating margins were 21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower restructuring costs. The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $0.3 million restructuring costs, and a $2.2 million offset to costs related to partial recognition of the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program grant which was awarded in the current year. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes $5.2 million of restructuring costs.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
Net Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $3,404.8 million, a decrease of $4,458.3 million, or 57%, compared with net revenues of $7,863.1 million, for the prior year. The decrease was primarily reflective of a significant decrease in B737 MAX production due to the B737 MAX grounding and lower production activity on the B787, B777, A350, and A320 programs due to COVID-19, partially offset by increased defense activity. Approximately 83% of the Company's net revenues in 2020 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.
Deliveries to Boeing decreased to 256 shipsets during 2020, compared to 867 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by production decreases on the B737, B777 and B787 programs. Deliveries to Airbus decreased to 591 shipsets during 2020, compared to 869 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by decreased production of the A320 and A350 programs. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components increased to 73 shipsets during 2020, compared to 55 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily reflective of incremental deliveries produced as a result of the Bombardier Acquisition.
Gross (Loss) Profit. Gross (loss) profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $(440.7) million, as compared to $1,076.7 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $1,517.4 million. The reduction in gross profit was primarily driven by significantly lower B737 MAX program production volume related to the B737 MAX grounding, lower B777 and A320 production volume related to the COVID-19 pandemic, forward loss charges of $370.3 million, primarily on the B787 and A350 programs due to reduced production rates, excess capacity production costs of $278.9 million related to temporary B737 MAX, A220, and A320 production schedule changes, and costs of temporary workforce reduction of $33.7 million in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies.
SG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $24.0 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $15.7 million lower as compared to the same period in the prior year. Both of these variances were driven by headcount reductions and other actions taken to preserve liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and B737 MAX grounding.
Restructuring Costs and Disposal of Assets. Restructuring costs were $73.0 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting cost-alignment and headcount reduction costs in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 in response to the B737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 pandemic. Losses on disposals of assets were $22.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, reflecting disposals of long-lived assets related to production decreases, process-related changes and quality improvement initiatives on the B787 and A350 programs.
Operating (Loss) Income. Operating (loss) income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $(812.8) million, which was $1,573.6 million lower than operating income of $760.8 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased margins on the B737, B777 and A320 programs mentioned above, $370.3 million of forward losses mainly driven by the B787 and A350 programs, excess capacity production costs of $278.9 million, and temporary workforce reduction costs of $33.7 million due to COVID-19, net of the U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies. The Company also recognized restructuring costs of $73.0 million for cost-alignment and headcount reductions, and a $22.9 million loss from the disposal of assets.
Interest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $160.3 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $17.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount compared to $78.6 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $3.6 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. The increase in interest expense was primarily as a result of the issuance of $1,200 million of Spirit’s 7.500% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 and $500 million of Spirit’s 5.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025.
Other (Expense) Income, net. Other expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was ($77.8) million, compared to other expense of ($5.8) million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense during 2020 was primarily driven by expenses related to a voluntary retirement program offered by the Company for cost alignment and headcount reductions and foreign exchange impact on the financial payment obligation under the repayable investment agreement between Shorts and the United Kingdom's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acquired as part of the Bombardier Acquisition.
Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $220.2 million compared to $(132.8) million for the prior year. The 2020 effective tax rate was 20.3% as compared to 20.0% for 2019. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily related to a valuation allowance recorded on nearly all deferred tax assets, a benefit from the CARES Act that enabled the Company to benefit from certain U.S. net operating losses at the former 35% corporate tax rate, the non-deductibility of the wages and benefits related to the Employee Retention Credit, the generation of state income tax credits in a loss year, and the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit due to a statute of limitation expiration.
Commercial Segment. Commercial segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $2,711.3 million, a decrease of $4,458.3 million, or (62.2%), compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily reflective of a significant decrease in B737 MAX production due to the B737 MAX grounding, as well as lower production activity on the B787, B777, A350, and A320 programs due to COVID-19 impacts. Commercial segment operating margins reflected a loss of (23%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of 14% for the same period in the prior year. The significant decrease in margins was primarily due to the impact of the B737 MAX grounding and related production decreases, forward loss charges on the B787 and A350 programs due to reduced production rates, excess capacity production costs of $265.5 million, and temporary workforce reduction costs of $33.7 million due in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the segment recorded restructuring costs of $64.0 million related to involuntary workforce reductions and voluntary retirement program ("VRP") costs, and a loss of $22.9 million reflecting disposals of long-lived assets related to production decreases, process-related changes and quality improvement initiatives on the B787 and A350 programs. In 2020, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $28.9 million and $366.8 million of net forward loss charges, primarily driven by production rate changes on the B787 and A350 programs mentioned above, which were from 10 aircraft per month to 5 aircraft per month, and 9 aircraft per month to 4 aircraft per month, respectively. In comparison, during 2019, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $4.5 million and $63.5 million of net forward loss charges primarily driven by production rate changes from 14 aircraft per month to 10 aircraft per month on the B787 program.
Defense & Space Segment. Defense & Space segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $491.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million, or (3.2%), compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a significant reduction, relative to the prior period, of the Boeing B737 program production schedule, for which the contracts include P-8 units that are accounted for in the Defense & Space segment. The reduction was related to the B737 MAX grounding and was partially offset by increased revenue from other defense programs, including incremental revenue from the Company's acquisition of FMI during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Comparatively higher production on Sikorsky programs, increased non-recurring defense work, and increased revenue on classified programs also contributed to partially offsetting the Boeing P-8 impact. Defense & Space segment operating margins were 10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 14% for the same period in the prior year, primarily related to excess capacity production costs of $13.4 million recognized in 2020 related primarily to temporary B737 MAX production schedule changes. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the segment recorded restructuring costs of $3.8 million related to involuntary workforce reductions and VRP costs. In 2020, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $1.5 million and $3.5 million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2019, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $2.5 million.
Aftermarket Segment. Aftermarket segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $202.2 million, an increase of $16.2 million, or 8.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue was driven by incremental revenue provided by the Bombardier Acquisition, partially offset by decreases to aftermarket sales activity driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aftermarket segment operating margins were 18% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 19% for the same period in the prior year. The variance to operating margins for the segment are primarily due to differences to sales mix between the two periods and restructuring costs of $5.2 million related to involuntary workforce reductions and VRP costs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from continuing operations. Other than cash flow from continuing operations, sources of our liquidity include cash on hand and borrowings made available by our Credit Agreement and senior notes.
Our cash flows from continuing operations generally have been adversely impacted by the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic (and resulting production rate changes associated with both events) and we expect the adverse impact to continue until aviation demand recovers. While we cannot give any assurances that air travel demand will recover soon enough
for us to fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations, based on the actions we took in 2020 and 2021, we believe our cash on hand and cash flows from continuing operations, coupled with our ability to vary our cost structure quickly, will provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our global cash needs over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. However, we could experience significant fluctuations in our cash flows from period to period during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, if the pace and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic recovery are worse than we currently forecast, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our Credit Agreement.
While the Company acted quickly to reduce costs in light of lower revenue expectations, the liquidity challenges resulted in the Company needing to issue significant amounts of additional debt. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had a debt balance of approximately $3,034.3 million, most of which was unsecured debt, and a cash balance of $2,350.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a debt balance of approximately $3,792.2 million, more than 50% was secured debt and a cash balance of $1,478.6 million. The Company's financial condition will continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for the next several years or until demand recovers. If the pandemic worsens or there is significant uncertainty on the industry’s recovery, we may find it difficult to obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations.
For purposes of assessing our liquidity needs in this section, we have assumed that our customers generally would not further reduce their production rates. For risks that may affect that assumption, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
2018 Credit Agreement
On July 12, 2018, the Company entered into a $1,256.0 million senior unsecured Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among Spirit, as borrower, Holdings, as parent guarantor, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents named therein (the “2018 Credit Agreement”), consisting of an $800.0 million revolving credit facility (the “2018 Revolver”), a $206.0 million term loan A facility (the “2018 Term Loan”) and a $250.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the “2018 DDTL”). Under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the 2018 Revolver, the 2018 Term Loan and the 2018 DDTL were to mature on July 12, 2023.
Spirit amended the 2018 Credit Agreement several times in 2020, including modifications that added security to the 2018 Credit Agreement. Spirit repaid the outstanding balance of the 2018 Revolver on April 30, 2020. On September 30, 2020, Spirit repaid the remaining balances under the 2018 Term Loan and the 2018 DDTL. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the 2018 Term Loan and 2018 DDTL was $0.0. On October 5, 2020 Spirit terminated the 2018 Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
On October 5, 2020, Spirit entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $400.0 million senior secured term loan B credit facility with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. On October 5, 2020 Spirit borrowed the full $400.0 million of initial term loans available under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also permits Spirit to request one or more incremental term facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed (x) in the case of any incremental facility that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Credit Agreement, the greater of (a) $950.0 million and (b) such other amount, so long as on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the first lien secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.25 to 1.00; and (y) in the case of any incremental facility that is secured on a junior basis to the Credit Agreement, the greater of (a) $500.0 million and (b) such other amount, so long as on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 5.00 to 1.00. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes. On November 15, 2021, the Company entered into a first refinancing, incremental assumption and amendment agreement (the “November 2021 Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement as amended by the November 2021 Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). The November 2021 Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) the refinancing of the $397.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of the November 2021 Amendment (the “Existing Term Loans”) with term loans in an equal principal amount with a lower interest rate (the “Repriced Term Loans”) and (ii) an incremental term loan facility of $203.0 million in aggregate principal amount with the same terms as the Repriced Term Loans (the "Incremental Term Loans" and, together with the Repriced Term Loans, the “Term Loans”). A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loans was used to refinance the Existing Term Loans, and the remainder will be used to fund payments to the government of the United Kingdom and/or for general corporate purposes, including the repayment or redemption of debt. The Term Loans will mature on January 15, 2025 and amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 1.00% per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. Following the effectiveness of the November 2021 Amendment, the Term Loans bear interest, at Spirit’s option, of LIBOR plus an applicable margin (3.50% or 3.75%) or base rate plus an applicable margin (2.50% or 2.75%). The applicable margin is based on Spirit's first lien secured gross leverage ratio.
The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Holdings and Spirit AeroSystems North Carolina, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Spirit NC”), (collectively, the “Guarantors”) and each existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material domestic subsidiary of Spirit, subject to certain customary exceptions. The obligations are secured by a first-priority lien with respect to substantially all assets of Spirit and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities and transactions of this type and that, among other things, restrict the Company and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, consolidate or merge, make acquisitions and other investments, guarantee obligations of third parties, make loans or advances, declare or pay certain dividends or distributions on the Company’s stock, redeem or repurchase shares of the Company’s stock, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into agreements restricting the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or dispose of assets. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations.
The Amended Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving the Company and its material subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the Credit Agreement was $598.5 million and the carrying value was $595.2 million.
First Lien 2025 Notes
On October 5, 2020, Spirit entered into an Indenture (the “First Lien 2025 Notes Indenture”), by and among Spirit, the Guarantors, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee and collateral agent, in connection with Spirit’s offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the “First Lien 2025 Notes"). As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the First Lien 2025 Notes was $500.0 million and the carrying value was $495.3 million.
The First Lien 2025 Notes were issued and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The First Lien 2025 Notes mature on January 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per year payable semiannually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The first interest payment date was January 15, 2021.
The First Lien 2025 Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by certain real property and personal property, including certain equity interests, owned by Spirit and the Guarantors. The First Lien 2025 Notes and guarantees are Spirit’s and the Guarantors’ senior secured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of their existing and future senior indebtedness, effectively equal with their existing and future indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis by the collateral for the First Lien 2025 Notes to the extent of the value of the collateral (including the Amended Credit Agreement and the 2026 Notes), effectively senior to all of their existing and future indebtedness that is not secured by a lien, or is secured by a junior-priority lien, on the collateral for the First Lien 2025 Notes to the extent of the value of the collateral, effectively junior to any of their other existing and future indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute collateral for the First Lien 2025 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets, and senior in right of payment to any of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.
The First Lien 2025 Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit Spirit’s, the Company’s and the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, to incur indebtedness secured by liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make restricted payments and investments and enter into certain mergers or consolidations and transfer substantially all of the Company and its subsidiaries’ assets. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations. In addition, the First Lien 2025 Indenture provides for customary events of default.
2026 Notes
In June 2016, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due June 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2016. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the 2026 Notes was $300.0 million and the carrying value was $298.4 million. The Company and Spirit NC guarantee Spirit's obligations under the 2026 Notes on a senior secured basis.
On February 24, 2020, Spirit entered into a Second Supplemental Indenture (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) by and among Spirit, the Company, Spirit NC, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the “Trustee”), as trustee in connection with the 2026 Notes. Under the Second Supplemental Indenture, the 2026 Noteholders were granted security on an equal and ratable basis with the lenders under the 2018 Credit Agreement until the security in favor of the lenders under the 2018 Credit Agreement was released on October 5, 2020. The Supplemental Indenture also added Spirit NC as an additional guarantor under the indenture governing the 2026 Notes.
On April 17, 2020, Spirit entered into a Third Supplemental Indenture (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”), by and among Spirit, the Company, Spirit NC and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee in connection with the 2026 Notes. Under the Third Supplemental Indenture, the noteholders were granted security on an equal and ratable basis with the holders of the Second Lien 2025 Notes.
On October 5, 2020, Spirit entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the “Fourth Supplemental Indenture”), by and among Spirit, the Company, Spirit NC and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee in connection with 2026 Notes. Under the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the holders of the 2026 Notes were granted security on an equal and ratable basis with the holders of the First Lien 2025 Notes and the secured parties under the Amended Credit Agreement.
Second Lien 2025 Notes
On April 17, 2020, Spirit entered into an Indenture (the “Second Lien 2025 Notes Indenture”), by and among Spirit, the Guarantors, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee and collateral agent, in connection with Spirit’s offering of $1,200.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.500% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 (the “Second Lien 2025 Notes”).
The Second Lien 2025 Notes were issued and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Second Lien 2025 Notes mature on April 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 7.500% per year payable semiannually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The first interest payment date was October 15, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the Second Lien 2025 Notes was $1,200.0 million and the carrying value was $1,187.5 million.
The Second Lien 2025 Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by certain real property and personal property, including certain equity interests, owned by Spirit and the Guarantors. The Second Lien 2025 Notes and guarantees are Spirit’s and the Guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of their existing and future senior indebtedness, effectively junior to all of their existing and future first-priority lien indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness (including indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Second Lien 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes), effectively junior to any of their other existing and future indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute collateral for the Second Lien 2025 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets, and senior in right of payment to any of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.
The Second Lien 2025 Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit Spirit’s, the Company’s and the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, to create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and guarantee other indebtedness without guaranteeing the Notes. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations. In addition, the Second Lien 2025 Notes Indenture provides for customary events of default.
Floating Rate, 2023, and 2028 Notes
On May 30, 2018, Spirit entered into an Indenture (the “2018 Indenture”) by and among Spirit, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee in connection with Spirit’s offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2021 (the “Floating Rate Notes”), $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.950% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.600% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes” and, together with the Floating Rate Notes and the 2023 Notes, the “2018 Notes”). Holdings guaranteed Spirit’s obligations under the 2018 Notes on a senior unsecured basis.
The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR, as determined in the case of the initial interest period, on May 25, 2018, and thereafter at the beginning of each quarterly period as described herein, plus 0.80 basis points and mature on June 15, 2021. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.950% per annum and mature on June 15, 2023. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.600% per annum and mature on June 15, 2028. Interest on the 2023 Notes and 2028 Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2018. On
February 24, 2021, Spirit redeemed the outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes. The outstanding balance of the Floating Rate Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2028 Notes was $0.0, $300.0 million, and $700.0 million as of December 31, 2021, respectively. The carrying value of the Floating Rate Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2028 Notes was 0.0, $299.3 million, and $695.2 million as of December 31, 2021, respectively.
The 2018 Indenture contains covenants that limit Spirit’s, the Company’s and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, to create liens without granting equal and ratable liens to the holders of the 2018 Notes and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations. In addition, the 2018 Indenture provides for customary events of default.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the indentures governing the First Lien 2025 Notes, Second Lien 2025 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2026 Notes, and the 2028 Notes.
For additional information on our outstanding debt, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt.
Receivables Financing
The Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances with Boeing, Airbus, and Rolls-Royce to third party financial institutions. These programs were primarily entered into as a result of customers seeking payment term extensions with the Company and continue to allow Spirit to monetize receivables prior to the payment date subject to payment of a discount. No guarantees are delivered under the agreements. Our ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of Boeing’s and Airbus’s financial condition. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.
Supply Chain Financing Applicable to Suppliers
We have provided our suppliers with access to a supply chain financing program through a facility with a third-party financing institution. This program was primarily entered into as a result of seeking market based payment term extensions with suppliers, and the program allows suppliers to monetize the receivables prior to their payment date, subject to payment of a discount. Our suppliers’ ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition. While our suppliers’ access to this supply chain financing program could be curtailed if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not expect that changes in the availability of supply chain financing to our suppliers will have a significant impact on our liquidity.
The balance of payables to suppliers who elected to participate in the supply chain financing program included in our accounts payable balance as of December 31, 2021 was $58.9 million. The balance as of December 31, 2020 was $53.4 million. Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in the supply chain financing program did not significantly increase or decrease over the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021. The payables to suppliers who elected to participate in the supply chain financing program decreased by $83.9 million for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreases in purchases from suppliers related to reduced production during the applicable period in relation to the immediately preceding period and not due to any changes in the availability of supply chain financing.
Credit Ratings
As of December 31, 2021, our corporate credit ratings were B by Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (“S&P”), and B2 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”). Throughout 2020, S&P and Moody’s downgraded our credit rating on a number of occasions. On January 13, 2020, Moody’s downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from Baa3 to Ba2. On January 31, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from BBB- to BB. On April 14, 2020, Moody’s further downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from Ba2 to Ba3, and on April 14, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from BB to BB-. On June 25, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to B+. On July 21, 2020, Moody’s downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to B2 with a negative outlook. On August 3, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to B with a stable outlook. On September 22, 2020, S&P affirmed its rating. On September 24, 2020, Moody’s affirmed its rating.
The ratings reflect the agencies’ assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal on our debt securities and credit agreements. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be considered independently of all other ratings.
As compared to the Company’s prior investment grade rating, the Company’s current rating and our credit condition affects, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Further negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt.
Derivatives and Hedging
The Company has entered into a series of currency forward contracts, each designated as a cash flow hedge upon the date of execution, for the purpose of reducing the variability of cash flows and hedging against the foreign currency exposure for forecasted payroll, pension and vendor disbursements that are expected to be made in the British pound sterling at our operations located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Casablanca, Morocco, and Dallas, Texas. The hedging program implemented is intended to reduce foreign currency exposure, and the associated forward currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through September 2022. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and recorded in earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction settles. The loss recognized in AOCI was $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum term of the hedged forecasted transaction was 9 months. Within the next 12 months, the Company expects to recognize a loss of $2.0 million in earnings related to the foreign currency forward contracts.
Cash Flows
The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020
Operating Activities.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net cash outflow of $63.2 million from operating activities, a decrease in net outflow of $681.7 million compared to a net cash outflow of $744.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash outflow from operating activities primarily represents improved cash flows from operating income and working capital driven by increased production in the current year, coupled with the negative impact of the timing of the prior year B737 MAX production suspension on working capital cash flows, and an income tax refund received in the current period that was larger than that received in the prior period.
Investing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net cash outflow of $163.8 million from investing activities, compared to a net cash outflow of $502.0 million for the prior year. This decrease in net outflow was primarily driven by the prior year Bombardier Acquisition, which was relatively large as compared to our current year acquisition, partially offset by greater capital expenditures in the current year.
Financing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net cash outflow of $163.5 million for financing activities, a change of $933 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $769.5 million for the same period in the prior year. In the current year, the Company's financing activities included redemption of the $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2021, refinancing of $397 million aggregate principal amount term loans with term loans in an equal principal amount with a lower interest rate, and an incremental term loan facility of $203 million in aggregate principal amount with the same terms as the repriced term loans. During 2020, the Company issued $400.0 million under the Credit Agreement, $1,200.0 million in Second Lien 2025 Notes, and $500.0 million in First Lien 2025 Notes, offset by an $800.0 million payment on the 2018 Revolver, a $400.0 million payment on the 2018 Term Loan A, and payment of debt issuance costs. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we paid a dividend of $4.3 million to our stockholders of record, compared to a dividend of $15.4 million paid in the prior year. The remainder of the decrease in net inflow from the prior year period was driven by customer financing repayments in the current year, versus proceeds in the prior year, and differences to taxes paid related to net share settlement awards.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
Operating Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net cash outflow of $744.9 million from operating activities, a decrease of $1,667.6 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $922.7 million for the prior year. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the B737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 pandemic that significantly impacted our deliveries across all programs and negative impacts of working capital requirements. Net tax receipts for 2020 were $62.5 million compared to net tax payments of $105.0 million during the prior year, primarily due to recognition of underlying taxable temporary differences.
Investing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net cash outflow of $502.0 million from investing activities, compared to a net cash outflow of $239.9 million for the prior year primarily driven by the FMI acquisition and the Bombardier Acquisition offset by reduced capital spend.
Financing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net cash inflow of $769.9 million for financing activities, a decrease in inflow of $114.5 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $884.4 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2020, the Company issued $400.0 million under the Credit Agreement, $1,200.0 million in Second Lien 2025 Notes, and $500.0 million in First Lien 2025 Notes, offset by the $800.0 million payment on the 2018 Revolver and $400.0 million payment of the 2018 Term Loan A and payment of debt issuance costs. During 2019, the Company drew $250.0 million on the 2018 DDTL and net draws of $800.0 million on the 2018 Revolver in December 2019. During 2020, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $15.4 million to its stockholders of record, compared to $50.4 million in 2019.
Future Cash Needs and Capital Spending
Impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the B737 MAX grounding have significantly impacted our liquidity requirements and operations. Our primary future cash needs will consist of working capital, research and development, capital expenditures, debt service, integration activity, potential merger and acquisition activity, and dividend payments. We expend significant capital as we undertake new programs, which begin in the non-recurring investment phase of our business model. In addition, we expend significant capital to meet increased production rates, which we expect will happen as air travel demand normalizes to 2019 levels (which may take several years); however, we cannot give any assurances that normalization will happen soon enough for us to fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations. We also require capital to develop new technologies for the next generation of aircraft, which may not be funded by our customers. Historically, share repurchases and dividend payments have also been factors affecting our liquidity. As described below, our share repurchase program is paused and we have reduced our quarterly dividend to one penny per share.
Our cash flows from continuing operations generally have been adversely impacted by the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic (and resulting production rate changes associated with both events) and we expect the adverse impact to continue until aviation demand recovers. While we cannot give any assurances that air travel demand will recover soon enough for us to fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations, based on the actions we took in 2020 and 2021, we believe our cash on hand and cash flows from continuing operations, coupled with our ability to vary our cost structure quickly, will provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our global cash needs over
the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. However, we could experience significant fluctuations in our cash flows from period to period during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, if the pace and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic recovery are worse than we currently forecast, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty in our industry. Air travel demand has deteriorated due to the pandemic and responsive government preventative measures. Our customers have reduced their production rates, which negatively impacts results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict the duration, impact or outcome of the pandemic and the resulting impact on the aviation industry and, accordingly, cannot predict the outcome on our operations. We have taken a number of actions to assist with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described earlier in this section.
Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, the B737 MAX grounding and its residual demand impacts created and continues to create significant liquidity challenges for the Company. Spirit delivered 162 B737 MAX shipsets in year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 606 B737 MAX shipsets in the year ended December 31, 2019. While we expect the production rate to increase in future periods, that expectation is subject to a number of risks that are described further in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
If production levels are further reduced by our customers for any reason (including the COVID-19 pandemic or demand challenges for the B737 MAX program, or otherwise) beyond current expectations or if we have difficulties in managing our cost structure to take into account changes in production schedules, our liquidity position may worsen if we are unable to procure additional financing, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.
In association to the Company’s acquisition of select assets of Bombardier aerostructures and aftermarket services businesses in Belfast, Northern Ireland (known as Shorts Brothers); Casablanca, Morocco; and Dallas, United States on October 30, 2020, the Company acquired certain liabilities as previously disclosed including the Shorts Pension and financial payment obligations under a repayable investment agreement between Shorts and the U.K.'s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The repayable investment agreement liabilities are payable in British pound sterling. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $41.7 million of the liability was recorded to other current liabilities and $301.9 million was recorded to Other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As of December 31, 2021, there was $925 million remaining in the Company’s Board-approved share repurchase program. Share repurchases are currently on hold due to the impacts of the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic.
On February 6, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors reduced its quarterly dividend to a penny per share to preserve liquidity. The Board regularly evaluates the Company's capital allocation strategy and dividend policy. Any future determination to continue to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual restrictions, including the requirements of financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will continue to be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.
The Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances with Boeing, Airbus, and Rolls-Royce to third party financial institutions. These programs were primarily entered into as a result of customers seeking payment term extensions with the Company and continue to allow the Company to monetize prior to the payment date for the receivables, subject to payment of a discount. No guarantees are delivered under the agreements. Our ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of Boeing’s and Airbus’s financial condition. If any of these financial institutions involved with these arrangements experiences financial difficulties, becomes unwilling to support Boeing or Airbus due to a deterioration in their financial condition or otherwise, or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the factoring arrangements, we may experience significant disruption and potential liquidity issues due to the failure of such arrangements, which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.
Foreign Operations
We engage in business in various non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2021, we have facilities in the U.K., France, Malaysia and Morocco. We are also members of two joint ventures in the People’s Republic of China.
Currency fluctuations, tariffs and similar import limitations, price controls, tax reform, and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations. Other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers, and additional political and economic risks. In addition, the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact.
Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties, and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments’ countries. Furthermore, the political, cultural, and economic climate outside the U.S. may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,130.8 million, or 29% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $767.2 million, or 23% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,296.8 million, or 16% of total net revenues for the same period.
Our foreign operations subject us to risks that are described further in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Information Regarding Guarantors of Spirit’s Notes Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933
Spirit’s 2026 Notes are guaranteed by Spirit AeroSystems North Carolina, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Spirit NC”) and Spirit Holdings, and Spirit’s 2023 Notes and 2028 Notes are guaranteed by Spirit Holdings. None of Spirit’s notes are guaranteed by Spirit’s or Spirit Holdings' other domestic subsidiaries or any foreign subsidiaries (together, the “Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”). Spirit Holdings consolidates each of Spirit and Spirit NC in its consolidated financial statements. Spirit and Spirit NC are both 100 percent-owned and controlled by Spirit Holdings. Spirit Holdings' guarantees of Spirit’s indebtedness are full and unconditional, except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met. Spirit Holdings' guarantees are also subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by the Company will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws.
The guarantees of Spirit Holdings and Spirit NC with respect to Spirit’s 2026 Notes are made on a joint and several basis. The guarantee of Spirit NC is not full and unconditional because Spirit NC can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances, including if it no longer guarantees Spirit’s Credit Agreement. Like Spirit Holdings' guarantees, the guarantee of Spirit NC is subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by Spirit NC will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws.
All of the existing guarantees by Spirit Holdings and Spirit NC rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness. The secured indebtedness of Spirit Holdings and Spirit NC (including guarantees of Spirit’s existing and future secured indebtedness) will be effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors. The guarantees are structurally junior to any debt or obligations of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including all debt or obligations of subsidiaries that are released from their guarantees of the notes. As of December 31, 2021, indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries included $107.2 million of outstanding borrowings under intercompany agreements with guarantor subsidiaries and $21.2 million of finance leases of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Based on our understanding of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-10”), we believe that the Spirit Holdings' guarantees of Spirit’s indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in Rule 3-10, which enable us to present summarized financial information for Spirit Holdings, Spirit and Spirit NC, which is a consolidated guarantor subsidiary, in accordance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. The summarized financial information excludes information regarding the non-guarantor subsidiaries. In accordance with Rule 3-10, separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented. The following tables include summarized financial information of Spirit, Holdings, and Spirit NC (together, the “obligor group”). Investments in and equity in the earnings of Spirit Holdings' Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, which are not a member of the obligor group, have been excluded. The summarized financial information of the obligor group is presented on a combined basis for Spirit and Spirit Holdings, and separately for Spirit NC, with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. The obligor group’s amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been presented in separate line items, if they are material. There are no non-controlling interest in any of the obligor group entities.
