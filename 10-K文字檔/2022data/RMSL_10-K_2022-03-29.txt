ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a Nevada corporation formed on June 6, 2007. Our headquarters are in Tampa, FL. We have been engaged in our current business model since January 1, 2015.
We are a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative and minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Our officers have 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including having been employed at sleep industry companies. Our goal is to develop sleep products that achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients.
In May 2017, we applied for a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office for our proprietary DeltaWave CPAP interface (“DeltaWave”), a new, innovative sleep apnea product to act as an interface for the delivery of CPAP therapy and other respiratory needs. DeltaWave is a nasal-pillow type interface designed to offer better comfort and, therefore, better compliance since it was specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally.
Our officers have 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including having been employed at sleep industry companies. Our officers invented the DeltaWave as an innovative new device to treat patients with sleep apnea. The patent-pending DeltaWave device is a nasal-pillows type interface that will result in better comfort and, therefore, better compliance since it was specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally.
A survey that appeared in DME Business found that 89% of patients stated that mask-interface comfort was their primary concern. The primary issue that we have addressed with the DeltaWave is the “work of breathing” component. We believe that our DeltaWave is designed to effectively address the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patient’s ability to comply with treatment, as follows: does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics; is not claustrophobic; causes zero work of breathing (WOB); minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses; uses less driving pressure; and allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping.
Pending adequate financing, we plan to conduct clinical trials to test product effectiveness.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenues
We generated no revenues during our fiscal years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Operating Expenses
Professional fees were $82,043 and $41,525 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $40,518, or 97.6%. Professional fees consist mostly of accounting, audit and legal fees. The increase is attributed to an increase in legal and audit fees associated with the filing of our Reg A. We had an increase of legal fees of approximately $22,100 and an increase of audit fees of approximately $14,900.
Development expense related to our DeltaWave CPAP system was $129,311 and $72,587 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $56,724, or 78.1%. Our development expense has increased in 2021 as we get closer to completing the DeltaWave CPAP system.
Compensation expense was $84,000 and $211,500 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the prior we incurred non-cash stock compensation expense of $127,500. There was no stock compensation expense incurred in the current year.
General and administrative expense (“G&A”) was $130,334 and $144,232 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $13,898, or 9.6%. The decrease is largely due to a decrease of investor relation services.
Total other expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, was $3,399,985. Other expense includes a loss in the change of fair value of $1,601,016, a loss on the issuance of convertible debt of $717,592, a penalty for default on convertible debt of $162,798 and interest expense of $918,579 (includes $813,619 amortization of debt discount).
Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $705,608. Other expense includes $611,535 of interest expense (includes $561,576 amortization of debt discount), a $350,986 loss on the issuance of convertible debt, an early payment penalty of $49,162 and a gain in the change of fair value of derivatives of $79,677. These are all expenses related to our convertible debt.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $3,825,673 as compared to a net loss of $1,175,452 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net loss can be attributed to our increase in other expense as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash flow from operations
Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $349,995 as compared to $335,293 of cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cash Flows from Investing
Cash used in investing activities for the purchase of equipment and tooling for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $67,252 as compared to $36,710 of cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cash Flows from Financing
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $591,300 from the issuance of convertible debt and $3,103,500 from the sale of common stock. We repaid $8,212 on our auto loan. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $460,000 from convertible debt loans and repaid $165,000. We also received $75,000 from the sale of common stock and repaid $3,344 on our auto loan.
As of December 31, 2021, we owe $399,400 to our convertible note holders.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $10,391,615 at December 31, 2021, had a net loss of $3,825,673 (approximately $3,295,000 was non-cash other expense related to convertible debt) and net cash used in operating activities of $349,995 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock and/or debt financing is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors over the next twelve months raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.
