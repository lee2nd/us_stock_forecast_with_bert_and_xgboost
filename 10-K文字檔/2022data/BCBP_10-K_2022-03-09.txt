ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General
This discussion, and other written material, and statements management may make, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions.
Forward-looking information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by the use of the words “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “predicts,” “forecasts,” “potential,” or “continue” or similar terms or the negative of these terms. The Company’s ability to predict results or the actual effects of its plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from anticipated results.
Factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in market interest rates, general economic conditions, legislation, and regulation; changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government, including policies of the United States Treasury and Federal Reserve Board; changes in the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios; changes in deposit flows, competition, and demand for financial services, loans, deposits and investment products in the Company’s local markets; changes in accounting principles and guidelines; war or terrorist activities; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, geopolitical and technological factors affecting the Company’s operations, pricing and services. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this discussion. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Critical accounting estimates are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experiences and management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Allowance for Loan Losses
Loans receivable are presented net of an allowance for loan losses and net deferred loan fees. In determining the appropriate level of the allowance, management considers a combination of factors, such as economic and industry trends, real estate market conditions, size and type of loans in portfolio, nature and value of collateral held, borrowers’ financial strength and credit ratings, and prepayment and default history. The calculation of the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires a substantial amount of judgment regarding the impact of the aforementioned factors, as well as other factors, on the ultimate realization of loans receivable. In addition, our determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the FDIC, as part of their examination process. After a review of the information available, our regulators might require the establishment of an additional allowance. Any increase in the allowance for loan loss required by regulators would have a negative impact on our earnings.
Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities
If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are “temporary” or “other-than-temporary” in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 320, Investments - Debt Securities. Accordingly, temporary impairments are accounted for based upon the classification of the related securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. Temporary impairments on available for sale securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the securities and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, the carrying values of held to maturity securities are not adjusted for temporary impairments. Information concerning the amount and duration of temporary impairments on both available for sale and held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Other-than-temporary impairments are accounted for based upon several considerations. First, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities that the Company has decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of fair value to a level equal to or exceeding amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the sale of debt securities are applicable, then the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on a debt security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. Credit-related other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in earnings and noncredit-related other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in OCI.
Deferred Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities: (i) are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or the consolidated and separate entity tax returns; (ii) are attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases; and (iii) are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, management considers the profitability of current core operations, future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and ongoing, feasible and permissible tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance for all portions determined not likely to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment. The valuation allowance is adjusted, by a charge or credit to income tax expense, as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.
Goodwill
The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on a qualitative assessment, management determined that the Company’s recorded goodwill totaling $5.2 million, which resulted from the 2018 acquisition IAB, is not impaired as of December 31, 2021.
COVID-19 Response
With the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Company remains focused on protecting the health and well-being of its employees and the communities in which it operates while assuring the continuity of its business operations.
The Company activated its dedicated pandemic team that proactively implemented its business continuity plans and has taken a variety of measures to ensure the ongoing availability of services, while taking health and safety measures, including enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities and remote work policies, where possible. To date, as a result of these business continuity measures, the Company has not experienced significant disruptions in its operations.
Operational Initiatives
oManagement meets on an as-needed basis and actively monitors guidance released by regulators, banking associations as well as state and local government.
oMost employees have returned to work, however social distancing is still encouraged for those that are unvaccinated.
oBarriers are in place in branches and back offices to provide protection.
oBranch and operational offices are cleaned and sanitized as needed and employees have access to masks, gloves and disinfectant.
oManagement provides updates to employees as needed.
oThe Call Center is open seven days a week to assist with customer inquiries.
oBranch offices are open; however, customers have the ability to make an appointment if they choose. The Bank is encouraging customers to utilize the ATM, drive-through, mobile and electronic banking services whenever possible.
oThe Bank worked with a local provider throughout the year to have the vaccine administered voluntarily to its employees at one of the Bank’s locations.
Allowance for Loan Losses (“ALLL”)
oThe Bank lowered its loan loss reserves through a $985,000 credit in loan loss provisions for the fourth quarter of 2021, as compared to $1.9 million of provision expense for the same period last year. The Bank considered qualitative factors, such as changes in underwriting policies, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, the adequacy of the underlying collateral and the financial strength of borrowers in arriving at its loan loss provision. All of these factors are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan categories for specific business types were stressed due to rising or elevated levels of delinquency within those market sectors (restaurants, mixed use/office space, and commercial condos) to determine the potential for collateral shortfalls. At December 31, 2021 the stress tests resulted in collateral shortfalls and costs associated with foreclosure that were lower than the previous three quarters by approximately $1.0 million. Adjustments to the ALLL may be required as the full impact of COVID-19 on the borrowers’ capacity to make payments and the value of the underlying collateral becomes known.
Loan Deferments
oThe banking regulatory agencies, through an Interagency Statement dated April 7, 2020, encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who request loan modifications or deferrals as a result of COVID-19. The Bank did so in 2020, but now has no deferred loans within its portfolio.
oThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and provided over $2.0 trillion in emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes.
oThe Bank has worked with customers that previously requested loan deferments and entered into COVID-19 modifications. The loan balances for these customers at December 31, 2021 was approximately $21.0 million. The modifications generally provide a short-term, interest-only period. The Bank does not believe that these modified loans will result in losses, so long as the borrowers' representation of cash flows is realized. Borrowers that have requested modifications with less definitive cash flow projections have been denied and are being analyzed as part of the loan stress testing and Allowance for Loan Loss calculation.
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
oThe Bank partnered with The Loan Source, Inc. and NEWITY and recognized $495,000 in referral fees for the second round of PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2021.
IT Changes
oTo protect the well-being of our staff and customers, the Company has set up resources for some employees to work from home. To facilitate the move, we allocated laptop computers to staff and enhanced our ability to access the network offsite. We have taken additional steps to minimize the increased risk of security breaches (including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks), given the increased number of employees working remotely.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
oThe Company was well positioned with adequate levels of cash and liquid assets as of December 31, 2021, as well as wholesale borrowing capacity of over $880 million. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s equity to assets ratio was 9.23 percent and the Bank is considered “well capitalized” under its regulatory requirements. The Company will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in determining future cash dividends and any requirement for additional capital each quarter.
Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and 2020
Total assets increased by $146.5 million, or 5.2 percent, to $2.968 billion at December 31, 2021, from $2.821 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in total assets was mainly related to increases in total cash and cash equivalents.
Total cash and cash equivalents increased by $150.4 million, or 57.6 percent, to $411.6 million at December 31, 2021 from $261.2 million at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in deposits, partly offset by net repayments of borrowings.
Loans receivable, net, increased by $9.9 million, or 0.43 percent, to $2.305 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.295 billion at December 31, 2020. Total loan increases for 2021 included increases of $29.3 million in commercial real estate and multi-family loans, $6.7 million in commercial business loans, and $2.8 million in consumer loans, partly offset by decreases of $19.9 million in residential one-to-four family loans, $3.3 million in home equity loans, and $2.2 million in construction loans. The allowance for loan losses increased $3.5 million to $37.1 million, or 249.3 percent of non-accruing loans and 1.58 percent of gross loans, at December 31, 2021 as compared to an allowance for loan losses of $33.6 million, or 205.2 percent of non-accruing loans and 1.44 percent of gross loans, at December 31, 2020.
Total investment securities decreased by $7.1 million, or 6.0 percent, to $110.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $117.5 million at December 31, 2020, representing repayments, calls and maturities, partly offset by purchases of $26.1 million.
Deposit liabilities increased by $243.4 million, or 10.5 percent, to $2.561 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.318 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in deposit liabilities mainly related to the recent payments to individuals under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, adopted in March 2021 to provide additional relief for individuals and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and proceeds from the second round of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. Total increases for 2021 included $186.1 million in non-interest-bearing deposit accounts, $54.4 million in NOW deposit accounts, $32.0 million in savings and club accounts, and $21.9 million in money market checking accounts. The increase in deposits was partly offset by a decrease of $51.0 million in certificates of deposit, including listing service and brokered deposit accounts.
Debt obligations decreased by $119.2 million, or 52.2 percent, to $109.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $228.2 million at December 31, 2020. In 2021, the Company opted to extinguish $115.0 million in FHLB advances which held a weighted average rate of 1.60 percent. The advances were originally set to mature in 2021 through 2024. The effect of the extinguishment of the debt reduced the weighted average cost of FHLB borrowings by approximately 16 basis points on an annualized basis. The related expense for the extinguishment of this debt is included in noninterest expense. The weighted average interest rate of FHLB advances was 1.39 percent at December 31, 2021 and 1.66 percent at December 31, 2020. The fixed interest rate of our subordinated debt balances was 5.625 percent at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Stockholders’ equity increased by $24.8 million, or 10.0 percent, to $274.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $249.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in retained earnings of $22.8 million, or 39.1 percent, to $81.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $58.3 million at December 31, 2020, related to the effect of net income less dividends paid and amounts spent for stock repurchases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
Analysis of Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them, respectively.
The following table sets forth average balance sheets, yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums, which are included in interest income.
_______________
(1) Excludes allowance for loan losses.
(2) Includes non-accrual loans which are immaterial to the yield.
(3) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock.
(4) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
(5) Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in average volume (changes in average volume multiplied by old rate); (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by old average volume); (iii) changes due to combined changes in rate and volume; and (iv) the net change.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Net income increased by $13.4 million, or 64.2 percent, to $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income was primarily the result of decreases in total interest expense and the provision for loan losses, partly offset by decreases in interest and non-interest income and an increase in the income tax provision for 2021 as compared to 2020.
Net interest income increased by $17.0 million, or 21.1 percent, to $97.4 million for the year of 2021 from $80.4 million for the year of 2020. The increase in net interest income resulted from a $17.8 million decrease in interest expense, partly offset by a decrease of $853,000 in interest income.
This decrease in interest income of $853,000, or 0.8 percent, to $112.6 million for 2021 from $113.4 million for 2020 mainly related to a $1.9 million reduction in interest income from FHLB stock and other interest earning assets. This reduction related to a decrease in the average balance of FHLB stock and other interest-earning deposits of $24.8 million, or 6.2 percent, to $377.2 million for 2021 from $401.9 million for the year of 2020, as well as a decrease in the average rate on these funds of 46 basis points to 0.25 percent for the year of 2021 from 0.71 percent for the year of 2020. The decrease in the average balance of interest-earning deposits mainly relates to decreases in the average balances of deposits and FHLB advances. This decrease in interest income was partly offset by an increase in loan interest income due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of $8.0 million, or 0.3 percent, to $2.328 billion for the year of 2021 from $2.320 billion for the year of 2020, and the increase in the average rate on loans of one basis point. Interest income on investment securities also increased, mainly related to an increase in the average rate of 73 basis points to 3.64 percent for the year of 2021 from 2.91 percent for the year of 2020, relating to the purchase of higher yielding securities in the current year period. Interest income on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 also included $876,000 of amortization of purchase credit fair value adjustments related to a prior bank acquisition, which added approximately three basis points to the average yield on interest earning assets.
Interest expense decreased by $17.8 million, or 54.0 percent, to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 73 basis points to 0.71 percent for the year of 2021 from 1.44 percent for the year of 2020, as well as a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $154.6 million, or 6.7 percent, to $2.138 billion for the year of 2021 from $2.292 billion for the year of 2020. The decrease in the average cost of funds primarily resulted from the declining interest rate environment and an increased focus on managing funding costs. The decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from the Company’s strategy of continued deleveraging. The Company also opted to extinguish $115.0 million of FHLB advances over the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021, which held an average rate of 1.60 percent, compared to $47.0 million of FHLB advances over the 12-month period ended December 31, 2020, which held an average rate of 2.24 percent. The related non-recurring expense for the extinguishment of this debt was included in noninterest expense.
Net interest margin was 3.46 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2.83 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the net interest margin compared to the prior-year period was the result of the volatile financial markets in 2020 attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the current low interest rate environment. Management has been proactive in managing the Company’s cost of funds and has significantly decreased the average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities, while improving the average yield on interest-earning assets for the year of 2021 compared to the year of 2020.
The provision for loan losses decreased by $5.6 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to improved COVID-19 related economic metrics compared to the prior year period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced $375,000 in net charge offs compared to $465,000 in net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling $14.9 million, or 0.64 percent, of gross loans at December 31, 2021 as compared to $16.4 million, or 0.70 percent, of gross loans at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses was $37.1 million, or 1.58 percent of gross loans at December 31, 2021, and $33.6 million, or 1.44 percent of gross loans at December 31, 2020. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Total noninterest income decreased by $3.8 million, or 30.4 percent, to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in total noninterest income was mainly related to a decrease in the gain on sale of premises of $4.0 million, a decrease in realized and unrealized gains on equity securities of $1.6 million and a decrease in the gain on sale of investment securities of $964,000 in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year. Partly offsetting these decreases in noninterest income was an increase in BOLI income of $1.9 million and an increase in fees and service charges of $1.0 million in 2021 compared to the prior year. The decreased gain on sale of premises related to the completion of a sale/leaseback of certain offices that the Company sold to a private investor group in December, 2020. The realized and unrealized gains on equity investments are based on market conditions. The increased BOLI income
relates to an initial purchase of $60.0 million of BOLI in the fourth quarter of 2020 and an additional purchase of $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. The higher fees and service charges related primarily to $495,000 of referral fees for PPP loans in the current period.
Total noninterest expense was unchanged at $54.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $494,000, or 1.9 percent, to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $25.9 million for the same period in 2020. Excluding the $1.3 million of costs deferred for PPP loans in the prior-year period, salaries and benefits expense decreased $806,000, due to fewer full-time equivalent employees, partly offset by normal compensation increases. The costs deferred in the prior-year period represented salaries and benefit costs associated with direct PPP loan origination costs, which were amortized over the life of the loan. The number of full-time equivalent employees for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 296, as compared with 329 for the same period in 2020. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased by $388,000, or 3.3 percent, to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, largely related to the reduction of building sanitization costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior-year period and the closure of two of the Company’s branch offices in the fourth quarter of 2020. Data processing and communication expenses increased by $348,000, or 6.1 percent, to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, largely attributable to additional system applications. Director fees decreased by $505,000, or 32.6 percent, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lower amortization expense for stock option and restricted stock awards in the current period. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased by $379,000, or 40.6 percent, to $554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $933,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as management curtailed certain business promotion activities in the current period. The Company recognized expenses of $1.6 million for losses on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to the prepayment of higher-cost FHLB borrowings.
The income tax provision increased by $5.5 million, or 63.6 percent, to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the income tax provision was a result of higher taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to that same period for 2020. The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 29.0 percent compared to 29.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The overall objective of our liquidity management practices is to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to meet financial commitments and to take advantage of lending and investment opportunities. The Company manages liquidity in order to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings and other obligations as they mature, and to fund loan and investment portfolio opportunities as they arise.
The Company’s primary sources of funds to satisfy its objectives are net growth in deposits (primarily retail), principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, proceeds from the sale of originated loans and FHLB and other borrowings. The scheduled amortization of loans is a predictable source of funds. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises, including unsecured overnight lines of credit and other collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other correspondent banks.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no overnight borrowings outstanding with the FHLB. The Company utilizes overnight borrowings from time to time to fund short-term liquidity needs. The Company had total outstanding borrowings of $109.0 million at December 31, 2021 as compared to $228.2 million at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB of $305.8 million, utilizing unencumbered loan collateral. The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments in the normal course of business through typical sources of liquidity. Time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $569.2 million at December 31, 2021. Based upon historical experience data, management estimates that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the Company.
The Company was well-positioned with adequate levels of cash and liquid assets as of December 31, 2021, as well as wholesale borrowing capacity of over $880.0 million.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the capital ratios of the Bank exceeded the quantitative capital ratios required for an institution to be considered “well-capitalized”.
