Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
The consolidated financial statements included in this annual report include the financial statements of the Company and those of Passive Security Scan, Inc. ("PSSI"), a consolidated subsidiary
Effective January 12, 2017, PSSI was incorporated in the state of Utah as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company merged its wholly owned subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. ("Long Canyon"), into PSSI, with PSSI the surviving entity. The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company. The Company currently owns 76.28% of PSSI with 23.72% acquired by four other individuals and entities. With the merger of Long Canyon into PSSI, the Company discontinued its mineral exploration business. The Company plans to continue the development of the technology and conduct all sales and marketing activities in PSSI.
Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will” “should," “expect," "intend," "plan," anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," or similar terms, variations of such terms or the negative of such terms. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern. Through April 30, 2022, the Company had no revenue, has accumulated deficit of $13,916,844 and a working capital deficit of $3,515,106 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue to provide for the Company's capital needs during the year ending April 30, 2022 by issuing debt and equity securities and by the continued support of its related parties. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. There is no assurance that funding will be available to continue the Company’s business operations.
Results of Operations
We currently have a limited source of operating revenues. Accordingly, zero revenue was recorded in the year ended April 30, 2022 and $13,230 in 2021.
Our total operating expenses increased to $867,597 in the year ended April 30, 2022 from $745,128 in the year ended April 30, 2021. The increases are due primarily to a higher general expenses and consulting fees.
Our interest expense decreased to $203,388 in the year ended April 30, 2022 from $674,834 in the year ended April 30, 2021. In addition, our loss on notes was $21,610, finance and interest cost on notes of $7,500 in the year ended April 30, 2022 compared to $466,200 and $209,237 in the same time in 2021.
We recognized a decrease on derivative liability of $605,279 compared to a decrease of $192,924 in the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We estimate the fair value of the derivative for the conversion feature of our convertible notes payable using the American Option Binomial pricing model at the inception of the debt, at the date of conversions to equity, cash payments and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount and a gain or loss on change in derivative liability as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability and associated gain or loss on derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material.
We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $36,682 and a gain of $54,831 in the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change on extinguishment of debt resulted primarily from the elimination of derivative liabilities upon debt extinguishment. This will fluctuate from period to period depending on the number of debt conversions and the associated balance of derivative liabilities, and the fluctuation may be material.
As a result, we recognized a net loss of $718,325 and net loss of $1,845,644 on the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Because we own 76.28% of PSSI as of April 30, 2022 we include 76.28% of the net loss of PSSI for the year ended April 30, 2022 in our consolidated net loss and have reported non-controlling interest of 23.72% of the net loss of PSSI, or $42,701, for the year ended April 30, 2022 and $43,155 for the same period in 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At April 30, 2022, we had total current assets of $75,407, consisting of cash of $5,761 and inventory of $69,649. Current liabilities at April 30, 2022 were $3,590,513 resulting in a working capital deficit of $3,515,106. Included in our current liabilities and working capital deficit are derivative liabilities totaling $305,232 related to the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable. We do not believe the derivative liabilities will require settlement in cash.
A significant portion of our current liabilities as of April 30, 2022 is comprised of amounts due to related parties of $1,554,639. We anticipate that in the short-term, operating funds will continue to be provided by related parties and other lenders.
At April 30, 2022, we had total convertible notes payable of $330,821, net of discount. Several of the note agreements require repayment through conversion of principal and interest into shares of the Company's common stock. We anticipate, therefore, converting these notes payable into shares of our common stock without the need for replacement financing; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing this.
Pursuant to convertible notes payable, we received total cash proceeds of $75,000, less payment of notes payable of $5,733 and the sale of preferred shares of $177,500 or a net cash received from financing activities of $246,767 during the year ended April 30, 2022. These convertible short-term notes, which have a total principal balance of $330,821, net of discount at April 30, 2022, bear interest at annual rates ranging from 6% to 15% per annum and are convertible into common shares of the Company upon the terms and subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in the note agreements. The notes generally contain early repayment penalties if repaid before defined payment dates in the note agreements.
During the year ended April 30, 2022 we extinguished $132,728 in principal and accrued interest through conversion of convertible notes payable to common stock. During the year ended April 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $285,215 as a result of our net loss of $718,325 offset by amortization of debt discount and financing costs of $96,610, change in fair value of $492,187, increase in related party payables to $304,821, and accounts payable and accrued expense of $700,921.
During the year ended April 30, 2021 net cash used in operating activities was $363,207, as a result of our net loss of $1,845,644, amortization of debt discount and financing costs of $364,701 and a gain on derivative liability change of $192,924. Also during 2021 we had a gain in accounts payable of $303,845 and increase in payables to related party of 279,271, with a loss on notes of $466,200 and gains on debt extinguishment of $54,831.
During the year ended April 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $337,000. This was comprised of net proceeds from convertible notes payable of $272,500, partially offset by repayment of convertible notes payable of $135,500 along with preferred stock sold for cash of $200,000.
During the year ended April 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $246,767 comprised of net proceeds from convertible notes payable of 75,000, repayment of notes payable of $5,733 and the sale of preferred shares of $177,500
We have not realized any significant revenues since inception and paid expenses and costs with proceeds from the issuance of securities as well as by loans from investor, stockholders, and other related parties.
Our immediate goal is to provide funding for the completion of the initial production of the Offender Alert Passive Scan licensed from CCS. The Offender Alert Passive Scan is an advanced passive scanning system for detecting and identifying concealed threats.
We believe a related party and other lenders will provide sufficient funds to carry on general operations in the near term and fund PSSI’s production and sales. We expect to raise additional funds from the sale of securities, stockholder loans and convertible debt. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain financing to carry out our business plan.
As of April 30, 2022, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months.
Inflation
In the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations until such time as we begin to realize revenues from operations. At that time, management will evaluate the possible effects of inflation related to our business and operations following a successful acquisition or merger.
Net Operating Loss Carryforward
We have accumulated a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $5,092,861 as of April 30, 2022. This loss carry forward may be offset against future taxable income. The use of these losses to reduce future income taxes will depend on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforward. In the event of certain changes in control, there will be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforward that can be used. No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 because it has been fully offset by a valuation reserve. The use of future tax benefit is undeterminable because we presently have no operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to intangible assets, derivative liabilities, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
For further information on our significant accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. There were no changes to our significant accounting policies during the year ended April 30, 2022. The following is a description of those significant accounting policies that involve estimates and judgment by management.
Derivative Liabilities
We have identified the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable as derivatives. We estimate the fair value of the derivatives using American Option Binomial pricing model. We estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at the inception of the financial instruments, at the date of conversions to equity and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount, and a gain or loss on change in derivative liabilities as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.
Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted loss per share (“EPS”) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive common shares if their effect is antidilutive.
Financial Instruments
Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value using a hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence when measuring fair value using a hierarch based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization with the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
As of April 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company believes the amounts reported for cash, payables, accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to the nature or duration of these instruments.
Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were estimated as follows at April 30, 2022 and 2021:
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. As of April 30, 2019 the Company impaired the license agreement expensing $378,600.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
