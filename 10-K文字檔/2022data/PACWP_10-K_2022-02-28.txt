ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
PacWest Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the BHCA, with our corporate headquarters located in Beverly Hills, California. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank. References to “Pacific Western” or the “Bank” refer to Pacific Western Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to “we,” “us,” or the “Company” refer to PacWest Bancorp together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. When we refer to “PacWest” or to the “holding company,” we are referring to PacWest Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis.
The Bank is focused on relationship-based business banking to small, middle-market, and venture-backed businesses nationwide. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and lease and deposit products and services through 69 full-service branches located in California, one branch located in Durham, North Carolina, one branch located in Denver, Colorado, and numerous loan production offices across the country. The Bank provides community banking products including lending and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and medium-sized businesses conducted primarily through our California-based branch offices and Denver, Colorado branch office. The Bank offers national lending products including asset-based, equipment, and real estate loans and treasury management services to established middle-market businesses on a national basis. The Bank also provides venture banking products including a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial and venture-backed businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States. The Bank also offers financing of business-purpose non-owner-occupied investor properties through Civic, a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Bank also provides a specialized suite of services for the HOA industry. In addition, we provide investment advisory and asset management services to select clients through Pacific Western Asset Management Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and an SEC-registered investment adviser.
The following table presents balance sheet data as of the dates indicated:
At December 31, 2021, the Company had total assets of $40.4 billion, including $22.9 billion of total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, and $10.7 billion of securities available-for-sale, compared to $29.5 billion of total assets, including $19.1 billion of total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, and $5.2 billion of securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2020. The $10.9 billion increase in total assets since year-end was due primarily to a $5.5 billion increase in securities available-for-sale, a $3.9 billion increase in loans and leases, net of deferred fees, a $934.5 million increase in interest-earning deposits in financial institutions, and a $327.1 million increase in goodwill due to the Civic and HOA Business acquisitions.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had total liabilities of $36.4 billion, including total deposits of $35.0 billion and subordinated debt of $863.3 million, compared to $25.9 billion of total liabilities, including $24.9 billion of total deposits and $465.8 million of subordinated debt at December 31, 2020. The $10.5 billion increase in total liabilities since year-end 2020 was due mainly to increases of $10.1 billion in total deposits and $397.5 million in subordinated debt. The increase in total deposits was due primarily to continued strong deposit growth from our venture banking and community banking clients and the acquisition of the HOA Business, which added $4.1 billion of deposits. At December 31, 2021, core deposits totaled $32.7 billion, or 93% of total deposits, including $14.5 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, or 41% of total deposits. The increase in subordinated debt was due to the $400 million of subordinated notes issued by the Bank on April 30, 2021. The subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had total stockholders' equity of $4.0 billion compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The $404.7 million increase in stockholders' equity since year-end was due mainly to $607.0 million in net earnings, offset partially by $119.4 million of cash dividends paid and a $106.6 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. Consolidated Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 9.32% and 12.69% at December 31, 2021, compared to 10.53% and 13.76% at December 31, 2020.
Recent Events
Stock Repurchase Programs
On February 15, 2022, PacWest's Board of Directors authorized a new Stock Repurchase Program, effective March 1, 2022, to repurchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $100 million with a program maturity date of February 28, 2023.
Acquisition of HOA Business
On October 8, 2021, the Bank completed the acquisition of the HOA Business. The Bank paid cash consideration of $237.8 million, which represented the aggregate of a 5.9% deposit premium and the net book value of certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities. At closing, there were $4.1 billion of deposits, primarily core deposits, related to the HOA Business.
The HOA Business acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $201.6 million. All of the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. For further information, see Note 2. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Subordinated Notes Offering
On April 30, 2021, the Bank issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) due May 1, 2031 (the “Maturity Date”), if not previously redeemed. Subject to any redemption prior to the Maturity Date, the Notes will bear interest from and including the original issue date to, but excluding, May 1, 2026 (the “Reset Date”), at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum and from and including the Reset Date to, but excluding the Maturity Date, the Notes will bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to a benchmark rate (which is expected to be the Three-Month Term SOFR) plus 252 basis points. For further information, see Note 12. Borrowings and Subordinated Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Acquisition of Civic
On February 1, 2021, the Bank completed the acquisition of Civic in an all-cash transaction. Civic, located in Redondo Beach, California, is one of the leading lenders in the United States specializing in business-purpose residential non-owner-occupied investment properties. The acquisition of Civic advances the Bank’s strategy to diversify and expand its lending portfolio, diversify its revenue streams, and deploy excess liquidity into higher-yielding assets. Civic operates as a subsidiary of the Bank and at December 31, 2021 had $1.4 billion of loans outstanding. The loans are categorized as either income producing and other residential real estate mortgage or residential real estate construction and land based on their purpose.
The Civic acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $125.4 million. All of the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. For further information, see Note 2. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
COVID-19 Pandemic - Impact to Our Business
From a business perspective, the impact in 2021 from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has decreased, however, new variants may continue to impact key macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment and GDP and we will continue to closely monitor our loan portfolio. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an increase in customers seeking loan modifications through payment deferrals and extension of terms. Most of the modifications were for payment deferrals for three months, while some deferrals were up to six months. Some loans were subsequently modified with deferrals of three to twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, there were 23 loans with a balance of $42.5 million on deferral. The Company did not apply a TDR classification to COVID-19 related loan modifications that met all of the requisite criteria as stipulated in the CARES Act.
We actively participated in both rounds of the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), under the provisions of the CARES Act, originating $1.65 billion of PPP loans in 2020 and 2021 before the program ended on May 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, PPP loans totaled $156.7 million, net of deferred fees. In the fourth quarter of 2021, forgiven loans under the PPP program totaled approximately $110.6 million. The loans have origination fees that are recognized over the life of the loan with the fee recognition accelerated upon forgiveness or repayment of the loan. Fees recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized fees, net of deferred costs, totaled $4.2 million. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and do not carry an allowance.
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in March 2020, we immediately enhanced the monitoring of our loan and lease portfolio with particular emphasis on certain loan and lease portfolios that we expected to be most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the hotel, retail, commercial aviation, restaurant, and oil services loan and lease portfolios. We continue to closely monitor all of our portfolios, although with the increase in oil prices, and with our relatively low loan and lease balances with oil services borrowers ($76.7 million at December 31, 2021), the credit risk in the oil services portfolio has diminished. The hotel portfolio as of December 31, 2021 is comprised of hotel CRE loans of $593.2 million, hotel construction loans of $301.1 million, and hotel SBA loans of $28.0 million. These portfolios - hotel, retail, commercial aviation, and restaurant - have weathered the pandemic well thus far with net charge-offs of $4.6 million since the pandemic started.
The tables below shows our exposure to these loan and lease portfolios, which includes equipment leased to others under operating leases, as of the dates indicated:
From a credit perspective, most of our credit metrics improved during 2021 as economic conditions and economic forecasts continued to improve. This improvement led to a provision for credit losses benefit of $162.0 million for 2021, compared to a provision for credit losses of $339.0 million for 2020. For further details on CECL and the impacts to our process, see “- Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment” contained herein.
On a Company-wide basis, our operations continue to run normally despite the ongoing pandemic. Our branches and offices are open to serve our customers, although most non-client facing roles continue to work remotely or under a hybrid model. We expect most employees will return to the office sometime in 2022, but remain pleased how employees have embraced new technologies to assist in performing their responsibilities to ensure our operations continue to run smoothly.
Key Performance Indicators
Among other factors, our operating results generally depend on the following key performance indicators:
The Level of Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the excess of interest earned on our interest-earning assets over the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is net interest income (annualized if related to a quarterly period) expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Tax equivalent net interest income is net interest income increased by an adjustment for tax-exempt interest on certain loans and investment securities based on a 21% federal statutory tax rate. Tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary interest-earning assets are loans and investment securities, and our primary interest-bearing liabilities are deposits and borrowings. Contributing to our strong net interest margin is our strong yield on loans and leases and competitive cost of deposits. While our deposit balances will fluctuate depending on deposit holders’ perceptions of alternative yields available in the market, we seek to minimize the impact of these variances by attracting a high percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits.
Loan and Lease Growth
We actively seek new lending opportunities under an array of lending products. Our lending activities include real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, commercial loans and leases, and a small amount of consumer lending. Our commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans are secured by a range of property types. Our commercial loans and leases portfolio is diverse and generally includes various asset-secured loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, venture capital loans to support venture capital firms’ operations and the operations of entrepreneurial and venture-backed companies during the various phases of their early life cycles, and secured business loans.
Our loan origination process emphasizes credit quality. To augment our internal loan production, we have historically purchased loans such as multi-family loans from other banks, private student loans from third-party lenders, and, most recently, single-family residential mortgage loans. Prior to our acquisition of Civic, we also purchased loans from Civic. These loan purchases help us manage the concentrations in our portfolio as they diversify the geographic, interest-rate risk, credit risk, and product composition of our loan portfolio. Achieving net loan growth is subject to many factors, including maintaining strict credit standards, competition from other lenders, and borrowers that opt to prepay loans.
The Magnitude of Credit Losses
We emphasize credit quality in originating and monitoring our loans and leases, and we measure our success by the levels of our classified loans and leases, nonaccrual loans and leases, and net charge-offs. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which is the sum of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations as and when needed for both on and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Loans and leases that are deemed uncollectable are charged off and deducted from the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are added to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The provision for credit losses on the loan and lease portfolio is based on our allowance methodology, which considers the impact of assumptions and is reflective of historical experience, economic forecasts viewed to be reasonable and supportable by management, the current loan and lease composition, and relative credit risks known as of the balance sheet date. For originated and acquired credit-deteriorated loans, a provision for credit losses may be recorded to reflect credit deterioration after the origination date or after the acquisition date, respectively.
We regularly review loans and leases to determine whether there has been any deterioration in credit quality resulting from borrower operations or changes in collateral value or other factors which may affect collectability of our loans and leases. Changes in economic conditions, such as the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, rate of inflation, increases in the general level of interest rates, declines in real estate values, changes in commodity prices, and adverse conditions in borrowers’ businesses, could negatively impact our borrowers and cause us to adversely classify loans and leases. An increase in classified loans and leases generally results in increased provisions for credit losses and an increased allowance for credit losses. Any deterioration in the real estate market may lead to increased provisions for credit losses because our loans are concentrated in real estate loans.
The Level of Noninterest Expense
Our noninterest expense includes fixed and controllable overhead, the largest components of which are compensation and occupancy expense. It also includes costs that tend to vary based on the volume of activity, such as loan and lease production and the number and complexity of foreclosed assets. We measure success in controlling both fixed and variable costs through monitoring of the efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense (less intangible asset amortization, net foreclosed assets expense (income), goodwill impairment, and acquisition, integration and reorganization costs) by net revenues (the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, less gain (loss) on sale of securities and gain (loss) on sales of assets other than loans and leases).
The following table presents the calculation of our efficiency ratio for the years indicated:
The increase in noninterest expense used for the efficiency ratio in 2021, and the resulting increase in the efficiency ratio in 2021, were due in part to eleven months of operating expenses for Civic and three months of operating expenses for the HOA Business in 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results may ultimately differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and on our results of operations for the reporting periods.
Our significant accounting policies and practices are described in Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." We have identified three policies and estimates as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies relate to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment
For information regarding the calculation and policies of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment, see " - Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment" and Note 1(i). Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as goodwill, and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value. These fair values often involve estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, discount rates, future growth rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. Goodwill and other intangible assets generated from business combinations and deemed to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization and instead are tested for impairment annually unless a triggering event occurs thereby requiring an updated assessment. Our regular annual impairment assessment occurs in the fourth quarter. Impairment exists when the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess as a charge to "Noninterest expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governing taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities quarterly, and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain tax items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We determine whether a deferred tax asset is realizable based on facts and circumstances, including our current and projected future tax position, the historical level of our taxable income, and estimates of our future taxable income. In most cases, the realization of deferred tax assets is based on our future profitability. If we were to experience either reduced profitability or operating losses in a future period, the realization of our deferred tax assets may no longer be considered more likely than not and, accordingly, we could be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by charging earnings.
Non-GAAP Measurements
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of such financial performance. The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies. We use the following non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-K:
•Return on average tangible equity, tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per share: Given that the use of these measures is prevalent among banking regulators, investors and analysts, we disclose them in addition to the related GAAP measures of return on average equity, equity to assets ratio, and book value per share, respectively. In 2020, we changed the calculation of return on average tangible equity to add back intangible asset amortization to net earnings to arrive at adjusted net earnings. Prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the GAAP measurements are presented in the following tables for and as of the periods presented.
____________________________________________________
(1) Net earnings (loss) divided by average stockholders' equity.
(2) Adjusted net earnings divided by average tangible common equity.
_________________________________________________________________
(1) Tangible common equity divided by tangible assets.
(2) Tangible common equity divided by shares outstanding.
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share: These non-GAAP measurements are presented in the following tables for the periods presented. For the GAAP calculation of earnings per share, see Note 17. Earnings (Loss) Per Share of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Results of Operations
Earnings Performance
The following table presents performance metrics for the years indicated:
_____________________________
(1) See "- Non-GAAP Measurements."
2021 Compared to 2020
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $607.0 million, or $5.10 per diluted share, compared to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.24 billion, or $10.61 per diluted share. The $1.84 billion increase in net earnings was due primarily to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2020 combined with a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $501.0 million due to improvement in both the macroeconomic forecast variables used in the process to determine the allowance for credit losses and the loan portfolio credit quality metrics, offset partially by net loan growth for the year.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.24 billion, or $10.61 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $468.6 million, or $3.90 per diluted share. The $1.71 billion decrease in net earnings was due primarily to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2020, a higher provision for credit losses of $317.0 million, and higher operating expense of $11.8 million, offset partially by higher noninterest income of $3.5 million and lower income tax expense of $$89.1 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses for 2020 was the result of the impact of the current economic forecast used in our ACL estimation, which reflected a significant deterioration in key macroeconomic forecast variables such as unemployment and GDP growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in operating expense was due mainly to increases of $9.1 million in other expense, $6.2 million in insurance and assessments, $4.8 million in leased equipment depreciation, $3.7 million in customer related expense, and $3.5 million in foreclosed assets expense, offset partially by decreases of $14.4 million in compensation expense and $4.0 million in intangible asset amortization. The increase in noninterest income for 2020 was due primarily to a $15.6 million increase in dividends and gain on equity investments, offset partially by a $12.3 million decrease in gain on sale of securities.
Net Interest Income
The following table summarizes the distribution of average assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity, as well as interest income and yields earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, presented on a tax equivalent basis, for the years indicated:
_____________________
(1) Includes nonaccrual loans and leases and loan fees. Includes tax-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt interest on loans.
(2) Tax equivalent.
(3) Includes net loan premium amortization of $11.4 million for 2021 and net loan discount accretion of $5.6 million and $8.4 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(4) Includes tax-equivalent adjustments of $8.6 million, $6.1 million, and $6.2 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, related to tax-exempt interest on investment securities. The federal statutory rate utilized was 21%.
(5) Total deposits is the sum of interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The cost of total deposits is calculated as annualized interest expense on total deposits divided by average total deposits.
Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amounts of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The changes in the yields earned on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities are referred to as changes in “rate.” The changes in the amounts of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are referred to as changes in “volume.” The change in interest income/expense attributable to rate reflects the change in rate multiplied by the prior year’s volume. The change in interest income/expense attributable to volume reflects the change in volume multiplied by the prior year’s rate. The change in interest income/expense not attributable specifically to either rate or volume is allocated ratably between the two categories.
The following table presents changes in interest income (tax equivalent) and interest expense and related changes in rate and volume for the years indicated:
_____________________
(1) Tax equivalent.
2021 Compared to 2020
Net interest income increased by $89.3 million to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 due mainly to higher income on investment securities attributable to a higher average balance, offset partially by a lower yield combined with lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on deposits, borrowings, and subordinated debt in conjunction with decreased market rates, offset partially by higher average balances for interest-bearing deposits and subordinated debt. The tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 5.08% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 5.18% for 2020 attributable mainly to decreased market rates and the purchases of lower yielding single-family residential mortgage loans primarily in the second half of 2021.
The tax equivalent NIM for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.40% compared to 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due mostly to the change in the mix of average interest-earning assets and the lower yields on average investment securities and loans and leases, offset partially by lower costs of deposits, borrowings, and subordinated debt. The change in the mix of average interest-earning assets was due to a $3.8 billion increase in average deposits in financial institutions, a $3.3 billion increase in average investment securities, and a $518.3 million increase in average loans and leases. Average loans and leases as a percentage of average interest-earning assets was 60% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 76% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average investment securities as a percentage of average interest-earning assets was 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average deposits in financial institutions as a percentage of average interest-earning assets was 17% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The cost of average total deposits decreased to 0.09% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.27% for 2020 due to lower rates paid on deposits in conjunction with decreased market rates.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net interest income held steady at $1.01 billion for both the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 due mainly to a lower yield on average loans and leases, offset partially by a lower cost of average interest-bearing deposits and a higher balance of average loans and leases. The tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 6.00% for 2019. The decrease in the yield on average loans and leases was due mainly to lower loan coupon interest from the repricing of variable-rate loans in conjunction with decreased market rates and a lower rate on loan production from the impact of the PPP loans. Excluding the PPP loans, which have a coupon rate of 1%, the tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 5.27% in 2020.
The tax equivalent NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.05% compared to 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due mostly to the decrease in the yield on average loans and leases as described above, offset partially by the lower cost of average interest-bearing deposits. Excluding the PPP loans, the tax equivalent NIM was 4.08% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The cost of average total deposits decreased to 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 0.77% for 2019 due mainly to lower rates paid on deposits resulting from decreased market rates.
Provision for Credit Losses
The following table sets forth the details of the provision for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and information regarding credit quality metrics for the years indicated:
______________________
(1) See "- Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment" for detail of charge-offs and recoveries by loan portfolio segment, class, and subclass for the periods presented.
(2) 2019 is pre-CECL adoption on January 1, 2020; the ACL ratio under CECL at adoption was 0.97%.
Provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings for both on and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The provision for credit losses on our loans and leases held for investment is based on our allowance methodology and is an expense that, in our judgment, is required to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses.
The provision for credit losses decreased by $501.0 million to a provision for credit losses benefit of $162.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision of $339.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of improvement in both the macroeconomic forecast variables used in the process to determine the allowance for credit losses and the loan portfolio credit quality metrics, offset partially by net loan growth for the year.
The provision for credit losses increased by $317.0 million to $339.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of the impact of the current economic forecast used in our ACL estimation, which reflected a significant deterioration in key macroeconomic forecast variables such as unemployment and GDP growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Certain circumstances may lead to increased provisions for credit losses in the future. Examples of such circumstances are an increased amount of classified and/or nonperforming loans and leases, net loan and lease and unfunded commitment growth, and changes in economic conditions and forecasts. Changes in economic conditions and forecasts include the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, the rate of inflation, changes in the general level of interest rates, changes in real estate values, and adverse conditions in borrowers’ businesses. For information regarding the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment, see "- Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment," Note 1(i). Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment, and Note 5. Loans and Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Noninterest Income
The following table summarizes noninterest income by category for the years indicated:
2021 Compared to 2020
Noninterest income increased by $47.9 million to $193.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due mainly to increases of $38.7 million in warrant income, $8.1 million in dividends and gains on equity investments, and $6.0 million in other income, offset partially by a decrease of $11.6 million in gain on sale of securities. Warrant income increased due principally to higher gains from exercised warrants, driven by the active capital markets. Dividends and gains on equity investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity investments and higher income distributions on SBIC investments, offset partially by lower fair value gains on equity investments still held and lower fair value marks on SBIC investments. Other income increased due principally to higher gains from early lease terminations. The decrease in gain on sale of securities resulted from the sale of $365.7 million of securities for a gain of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to sales of $160.3 million of securities for a gain of $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
2020 Compared to 2019
Noninterest income increased by $3.5 million to $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due mainly to increases of $15.6 million in dividends and gains on equity investments and $4.9 million in leased equipment income, offset partially by decreases of $12.3 million in gain on sale of securities, $4.3 million in service charges on deposit accounts, and $3.3 million in other commissions and fees. Dividends and gains on equity investments increased due primarily to increases in the fair value of equity investments still held and higher gains on sale of equity investments sold. Leased equipment income increased due to early lease terminations resulting in higher termination gains in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and a higher average balance of leases in 2020 resulting in higher lease income as compared to 2019, offset partially by lower rental income attributable to two operating leases placed on nonaccrual status in 2020. The decrease in gain on sale of securities resulted from the sale of $160.3 million of securities for a gain of $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to sales of $1.6 billion of securities for a gain of $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased due primarily to lower analysis fees and NSF fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to last year as we waived certain fees for a period of time as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other commissions and fees decreased primarily due to lower credit card fee income and lower foreign exchange fees, offset partially by higher customer success fees.
Noninterest Expense
The following table summarizes noninterest expense by category for the years indicated:
2021 Compared to 2020
Noninterest expense decreased by $1.35 billion to $637.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 due mainly to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge incurred in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased by $123.4 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was due primarily to increases of $97.0 million in compensation expense, $8.4 million in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs, $6.9 million in leased equipment depreciation, and $6.2 million in other expense, offset partially by a $5.3 million decrease in insurance and assessment expense. The increase in compensation expense was due to the incremental compensation expense from 11 months of Civic operations and three months of HOA Business operations in the 2021 period and higher bonus expense, given the operating results in 2021, while the 2020 bonus amounts were below historical levels as a result of the higher provisions for credit losses in 2020. The increase in acquisition, integration, and reorganization costs was due to the costs related to the Civic and HOA Business acquisitions. Leased equipment depreciation increased due to a higher average balance of leased equipment. Other expense increased due mainly to higher legal settlement costs. Insurance and assessment expense decreased due mostly to a decrease in the FDIC assessment rate in 2021 partially offset by a higher assessment base. The assessment rate was higher in 2020 due to the goodwill impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2020 resulting in a higher assessment rate for the next four quarters.
2020 Compared to 2019
Noninterest expense increased by $1.48 billion to $1.98 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $502.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due mainly to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge incurred in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased by $11.8 million to $514.0 million in 2020. This increase was due mainly to increases of $9.1 million in other expense, $6.2 million in insurance and assessments, $4.8 million in leased equipment depreciation, $3.7 million in customer related expense, and $3.5 million in foreclosed assets expense, offset partially by decreases of $14.4 million in compensation expense and $4.0 million in intangible asset amortization. Other expense increased due mainly to $6.6 million in prepayment penalties incurred in the second quarter of 2020 from the early payoff of $750 million of FHLB term advances and higher litigation accruals, offset partially by lower business development expenses and employee related expenses as a result of COVID-19. Insurance and assessments expense increased due primarily to an increase in our FDIC assessment rate as a result of the first quarter 2020 loss from the goodwill impairment charge. Leased equipment depreciation increased due principally to a higher average balance of leased equipment. Customer related expenses increased due mostly to higher customer analysis expenses and reciprocal deposit referral fees. Foreclosed assets expense increased due principally to lower gains on the sale of foreclosed assets. Compensation expense decreased due mainly to lower bonus expense in the 2020 period compared to the prior year based on Company financial performance in 2020. Intangible asset amortization decreased due mostly to lower CDI amortization related to financial institutions acquired in 2015 and 2017.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rates were 26.2%, (6.5)%, and 26.0% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Excluding non-deductible goodwill impairment, the effective income tax rate was 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2021 compared to the 24.4% rate for 2020 was due primarily to an increase in the state apportionment rates for 2021 and a tax benefit recorded in 2020 for amended state returns. The Company's 2021 blended statutory tax rate for federal and state was 27.8%. For further information on income taxes, see Note 16. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Loans and Leases Held for Investment
The following table presents the composition of our total loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, by loan portfolio segment, class, and subclass as of the dates indicated:
________________________________
(1) Includes $151.8 million, $167.1 million, and $173.4 million, at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 of land acquisition and development loans.
Our loan portfolio segments of real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, and commercial loans comprised 49%, 15%, and 34% of our total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021, compared to 41%, 18%, and 39% at December 31, 2020, respectively.
The changes during 2021 in the portfolio classes comprising these portfolio segments reflected the following:
•Commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased by 8% to $3.8 billion or 17% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $4.1 billion or 21% at December 31, 2020. The lower balance and composition ratio was attributable primarily to the balance of other commercial real estate loans declining by 12% to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020.
•Income producing and other residential real estate mortgage loans increased by 95% to $7.4 billion or 32% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $3.8 billion or 20% at December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable primarily to $2.4 billion of single-family residential mortgage loans purchased during 2021 and loans originated by Civic since its February 1, 2021 acquisition date. Such Civic-originated loans totaled $956.2 million at December 31, 2021 and included business-purpose loans secured by for-rent residential properties, short-term bridge loans, and multi-family loans.
•Commercial real estate construction and land loans decreased by 25% to $832.6 million or 4% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $1.1 billion or 6% at December 31, 2020.
•Residential real estate construction and land loans increased by 16% to $2.6 billion or 11% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $2.2 billion or 12% at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to the business-purpose loans secured by non-owner-occupied residential properties undergoing renovation that were originated by Civic since its February 1, 2021 acquisition date which totaled $422.4 million at December 31, 2021.
•Asset-based loans and leases increased by 19% to $4.1 billion or 18% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $3.4 billion or 18% at December 31, 2020. The higher balance was attributable primarily to the balance of lender finance loans increasing by 25% to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020.
•Venture capital loans increased by 37% to $2.3 billion or 10% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $1.7 billion or 9% at December 31, 2020. The higher balance and composition ratio was attributable primarily to higher equity fund loans, offset partially by lower venture lending loans to venture-backed companies. Equity fund loans increased to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Venture lending loans decreased to $613.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $665.8 million at December 31, 2020.
•Other commercial loans decreased by 38% to $1.5 billion or 6% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 from $2.4 billion or 12% at December 31, 2020. The lower balance and composition ratio was attributable primarily to the balance of Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans decreasing by 85% to $156.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the geographic composition of our real estate loans held for investment, net of deferred fees, by the top ten states and all other states combined (in the order presented for the current year-end) as of the dates indicated:
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 61% and 62% of our real estate loans were collateralized by property located in California because our full-service branches and our community banking activities are primarily located in California. The increase in real estate loans in Colorado reflects the growth from opening our Denver branch in November 2019.
The following table presents a roll forward of loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, for the years indicated:
_______________________________________
(1) Includes direct financing leases but excludes equipment leased to others under operating leases.
(2) The weighted average rate on production presents contractual rates on a tax equivalent basis and does not include amortized fees. Amortized fees added approximately 38 basis points to loan yields in 2021, 25 basis points to loan yields in 2020, and 22 basis points to loan yields in 2019.
Loan and Lease Interest Rate Sensitivity
The following table presents contractual maturity information for loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, as of the date indicated:
At December 31, 2021, we had $5.6 billion of loans and leases held for investment due to mature over the next twelve months. For any of these loans and leases held for investment, in the event that we provide a concession through a refinance or modification that we would not ordinarily consider in order to protect as much of our investment as possible, such loans may be considered TDRs even though the loans have performed in accordance with their contractual terms. The circumstances regarding any modifications and a borrower's specific situation, such as its ability to obtain financing from another source at similar market terms, are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if a contractual loan renewal or loan extension constitutes a TDR. Higher levels of TDRs may result in increases in classified loans and credit loss provisions.
The following table presents the interest rate profile of loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, due after one year as of the date indicated:
