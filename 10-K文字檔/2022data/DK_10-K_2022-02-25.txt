Management's Discussion and Analysis
Executive Summary: Management's View of Our Business and Strategic Overview
We are an integrated downstream energy business focused on petroleum refining, the transportation, storage and wholesale distribution of crude oil, intermediate and refined products and convenience store retailing.
Business and Economic Environment Overview
As we reflect on the macro environment in 2021, the economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, both globally and domestically. However, despite improved consumer demand resulting from stabilization in cases of COVID-19 and decreasing mortality rates during much of the period and across much of the country, and corresponding to the availability of vaccines, improvements in domestic refining margins have been slow to materialize. This was largely attributable to limited demand from international markets where consumer demand improvement has lagged behind the U.S. resulting in the closing of much of the U.S. export arbitrage. In February 2021, the operations of many U.S. refineries, including ours, were temporarily disrupted due to the negative effects arising out of Winter Storm Uri. This contributed to a significant depletion of transportation fuel inventories throughout much of the country. Additionally, in May 2021, there was a cybersecurity incident with the Colonial Pipeline which resulted in pipeline shutdowns that interrupted supply to much of the eastern U.S. for six days, and which caused disruption for Delek primarily at our Krotz Springs refinery. As a result of both of these events, the U.S. market attracted higher levels of supply from international markets, which diluted price increases and associated refining margins for much of the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2021 finished strong for the downstream oil and gas sector, with higher oil prices, widening crack spreads and improving demand for refined product.
While there have been improving crack spreads during 2021, driven largely by the improvement in domestic consumer demand and the modest economic improvement and outlook associated with stabilizing Pandemic uncertainties, the ability of U.S. refiners to capture those improvements were impacted by the following macro factors:
•Rising RIN Prices: For the first half of the year, the RINs market was impacted by 2020's judicial rulings imposing limitations on smaller refineries' abilities to qualify for the EPA's SREs under the RFS, which was exacerbated by worsening environmental regulatory sentiment coming out of Washington, D.C. Following the June 2021 U.S. Supreme Court reversal of the lower court's ruling, however, there was a notable improvement in market optimism that existing SRE applications from 2019, as well as new applications for 2020, may be granted. As a result, we saw some improvement in RIN prices during the third quarter 2021, in anticipation of possible EPA relief. This expectation was dampened by the release of a proposed rule by the EPA in December 2021 which recommended revised volumetric rates for 2020 and, for the first time, introduced proposed rates for 2021 and 2022, with no final ruling on the likelihood of small refinery exemptions. Also of note, movements in crack spreads behave independently from movements in RFS regulatory requirements and RINs prices and thus can disproportionately impact small refiners. For example, in periods of low crack spreads and high RIN costs (which are a function of both regulatory volumetric requirements and market RINs prices), small refineries may experience negative operating results where other, larger refineries with better economies of scale and other competitive advantages may fare better. Even when increases in crack spreads coincide with the independent increases in RIN prices, small refiners may continue to see a larger burden of such costs on crack spread capture in contribution margin than many larger refineries experience.
•Rising Energy Costs: Crack spread capture was further impacted by rising energy (natural gas and electricity) costs. Throughout most of 2021, domestic natural gas demand outpaced growth in supply and contributed to sustained increases in natural gas prices. Additional factors, including increased exports triggered by unusually high international gas prices, as well as critical pipeline outages and the prices and availability of substitute fuels for power generation, put additional upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices. The spike in natural gas prices in the first quarter of 2021 relating to Winter Storm Uri had a significant impact on our refining contribution margin, and despite mitigating commercial efforts, the high natural gas prices continued to impact our crack spread capture for the remainder 2021.
•Unfavorable Location Differentials: Most midstream and downstream oil and gas entities have competitive advantages or disadvantages that relate to their geographic positioning. We have a significant presence in the Permian Basin, with one of our best performing refineries and much of our gathering assets located there. For these reasons, our refining operations are heavily dependent on Midland WTI crude, and our refining margins are likewise impacted by the Midland-Cushing differential. While an unfavorable Midland differential compared to Cushing on WTI crude oil will have a negative impact on our results, a favorable differential (or discount compared to Cushing barrels) will significantly increase our refining margin. Such conditions are highly dependent on domestic and global demand and supply, which can be impacted by geopolitical conditions as well as unexpected outages or disruptions and can shift quickly.
See further discussion on macroeconomic factors and market trends, including the impact on 2021 and the outlook for 2022, in the ‘Market Trends’ section below.
Overall, our Refining results are much improved in 2021 compared to 2020, largely attributable to improvements in oil prices and crack spreads combined with cost control efforts we implemented, while Pandemic-related pressure on demand combined with high RIN costs and energy costs continued to strain our crack spread capture in contribution margin. On the positive side, while increasing RINs prices weighed negatively on Refining margins; year-over-year we experienced improvement in crack spread net of incremental RINs cost, driven primarily by steadily improving crack spreads during most of 2021 combined with a fourth quarter 2021 stabilization of RIN costs to first quarter 2021 quarter levels. Furthermore, while RINs costs will impact our capture rate in a more pronounced manner than many larger refineries, if RINs costs stabilize, we are poised to take advantage of possible widening crack spreads and increased demand in 2022. If we receive SREs, the benefit will be even more significant, and will allow us to maintain a more consistent capture rate, which will align more closely to some of the larger refiners. Logistics results continued to be strong in 2021 and benefited from MVCs during periods that may otherwise have been constrained, such as

Management's Discussion and Analysis
the first quarter when much of our market was impacted by the winter storm. Logistics also continues to benefit from strong performance amongst our pipeline joint venture investments. Retail stores continue to perform well and we are beginning to realize the benefit of store optimization activities we conducted during the past two years, and we expect to begin seeing growth from new stores and successful re-branding. Looking forward to 2022, besides the expected favorable benefit of market improvements described above, we have many strategic initiatives that align with our new long-term sustainability view, as discussed in the ‘Strategic Overview’ section below. Additionally, in 2022, we expect to begin realizing returns from our indirect investment in the WWP pipeline, as the majority of the segments are now fully online and supported by existing throughput MVCs, and we also look forward to evaluating the potential for exercising our call option for a 33 1/3% limited member interest in a clean energy facility in California.
The refining segment (or "Refining") processes crude oil and other feedstocks for the manufacture of transportation motor fuels, including various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, asphalt and other petroleum-based products that are distributed through owned and third-party product terminals. The refining segment has a combined nameplate capacity of 302,000 bpd as of December 31, 2021. A high-level summary of the refinery activities is presented below:
(1) While the El Dorado refinery has a total nameplate capacity of 80,000 bpd, in order to qualify for the small refinery exemption under the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standards regulations total output cannot exceed 75,000 bpd. We currently expect that the El Dorado refinery’s output will remain under the 75,000 bpd threshold in the current economic environment.
(2) While there is variability in the crude slate and the product output at the El Dorado refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the U.S. Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread because we believe it to be the most closely aligned benchmark.
(3) Our Big Spring refinery is capable of processing substantial volumes of sour crude oil, which has historically cost less than intermediate, and/or substantial volumes of sweet crude oil, and therefore the WTI Cushing/WTS price differential, taking into account differences in production yield, is an important measure for helping us make strategic, market-respondent production decisions.
(4) The Krotz Springs refinery has the capability to process substantial volumes of light sweet crude oil to produce a high percentage of refined light products.
Our refining segment also owns and operates three biodiesel facilities involved in the production of biodiesel fuels and related activities, located in Crossett, Arkansas, Cleburne, Texas, and New Albany, Mississippi.
Our logistics segment (or "Logistics") gathers, transports and stores crude oil and markets, distributes, transports and stores refined products in select regions of the southeastern United States and West Texas for our refining segment and third parties. It is comprised of the consolidated balance sheet and results of operations of Delek Logistics (NYSE: DKL), where we owned a 79.8% interest at December 31, 2021. Delek Logistics was formed by Delek in 2012 to own, operate, acquire and construct crude oil and refined products logistics and marketing assets. A substantial majority of Delek Logistics' assets are currently integral to our refining and marketing operations. The logistics segment's pipelines and transportation business owns or leases capacity on approximately 400 miles of crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 450 miles of refined product pipelines, and an approximately 900-mile crude oil gathering system and associated crude oil storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 10.2 million barrels of active shell capacity. It also owns and operates ten light product terminals and markets light products using third-party terminals. Logistics has strategic investments in pipeline joint ventures that provide access to pipeline capacity as well as the potential for earnings from joint venture operations. The logistics segment owns or leases approximately 264 tractors and 353 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil and other products for related and third parties.
Our retail segment (or "Retail") at December 31, 2021 includes the operations of 248 owned and leased convenience store sites located primarily in West Texas and New Mexico. Our convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline and diesel under the DK or Alon brand name and food products, food service, tobacco products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, general merchandise as well as money orders to the public, primarily under the 7-Eleven and DK or Alon brand names pursuant to a license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. In

Management's Discussion and Analysis
November 2018, we terminated the license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. and the terms of such termination and subsequent amendments require the removal of all 7-Eleven branding on a store-by-store basis by December 31, 2023. Merchandise at our convenience store sites will continue to be sold under the 7-Eleven brand name until 7-Eleven branding is removed pursuant to the termination. As of December 31, 2021, we have removed the 7-Eleven brand name at 55 of our store locations. Substantially all of the motor fuel sold through our retail segment is supplied by our Big Spring refinery, which is transferred to the retail segment at prices substantially determined by reference to published commodity pricing information. In connection with our Retail strategic initiatives, we closed or sold 51 under-performing or non-strategic store locations since the fourth quarter of 2018.
Our corporate activities, results of certain immaterial operating segments, discontinued operations, our asphalt terminal operations, our wholesale crude operations, and intercompany eliminations are reported in 'corporate, other and eliminations' in our segment disclosures. Additionally, our corporate activities include certain of our commodity and other hedging activities.
The Road So Far: A Look Back
In recent years, the Company's overall strategy has been to take a disciplined approach that looks to balance returning cash to our shareholders and prudently investing in the business to support safe and reliable operations, while exploring opportunities for growth. Our goal has been to balance the different aspects of this program based on evaluations of each opportunity and how it matches our strategic goals for the Company, while factoring in market conditions and expected cash flows. To that end, in 2019, Delek’s leadership team built a Five-Year Strategic Framework to facilitate development of the Company’s strategies and initiatives. This framework lays out the Company’s overarching objectives for a five-year period and provides the foundation for our Core Strategic Focus Areas, our Strategic Initiatives, and ultimately our Annual Strategic Priorities, as follows:
Previous Core Strategic Focus Areas
During much of the first half of 2021, our principal focus was on managing the operational and financial risks related to the COVID-19 Pandemic while also maintaining our attention on these Core Strategic Areas of Focus, which in turn continued to guide our objectives and initiatives:
I. Safety and wellness.
II. Reliability and integrity.
III. Systems and processes.
IV. Risk-based decision making.
V. Positioning for growth.
We have consistently reevaluated our initiatives and immediate strategic priorities in light of the significant economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. We also have continued to actively review our targeted Pandemic strategies and related operational objectives and consider the need for changes in order to address the evolving industry and market, while ensuring that we continue to appropriately consider
61 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
and capitalize on our operational strengths and strategic positioning in the near term. As the impact of the Pandemic began to stabilize in the latter half of 2021, we began to shift our attention to the post-Pandemic horizon in earnest, now that there's a clearer picture of what that may look like. Capitalizing on our unwavering commitment to strategic thinking in a rapidly changing environment, we have embraced a seismic shift in perspective around our long-term strategic direction and outlook, which now is guiding changes to our strategic framework and objectives. The critical principle underlying this evolving perspective is sustainability, and is discussed in more detail below.
Evolving Focus: A Sustainability Strategy
It is vitally important that our strategic process, especially in view of the evolutionary direction of our macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, involves a continuous evaluation of our business model in terms of long-term economic and operational sustainability. We are operating in a mature industry (the production, logistics and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based refined products), with increasingly difficult operational and regulatory challenges and, likewise, pressure on operating costs/gross margins as well as the availability and cost of capital. More consolidation in our industry is expected as the regulatory environment continues to move towards reducing carbon emissions and transitions to renewable energy in the long-term. Additionally, evolving consumer and capital markets sentiment, regulations, talent availability, supply chain constraints and customer demand are expected to cause disruption and increasing pressure in the intermediate term. In order to compete under historic environmental and regulatory changes, companies in our industry will need to be adaptive, forward-thinking and strategic in their approach to long-term sustainability. What this picture looks like, as we come to understand it, is what we refer to as our "Sustainability View."
A New Framework: Long-Term Sustainability
The emphasis on environmental responsibility and long-term economic and environmental sustainability is accelerating, with increased demand for transparency evolving out of the ESG movement. As we evaluate our current ESG positioning in the market, we also must integrate a broader sustainability view to all of our activities, both operational and strategic. For these reasons, we have developed a Long-Term Sustainability Framework, which will help us to formulate our strategic objectives and initiatives.
Long-Term Sustainability Framework: Overarching Objectives
Certain fundamental principles are foundational to our Long-Term Sustainability Framework, and direct us as we develop our guiding objectives. With that in mind, we have initially identified the following overarching objectives:
I. Redirect Corporate Culture towards Innovation, Excellence, and Operating Discipline.
II. Focus on Operational Optimization and Improved Margin Capture.
III. Implement Digital Transformation Strategy.
IV. Identify ESG-Conscious Investments with Clear Value Propositions and Sustainable Returns.
V. Evaluate Strategic Priorities and Redefine Long-term Sustainable Business Model.
Long-Term Sustainability Framework: Key Initiatives
Additionally, integral to our Long-Term Sustainability Framework and the achievement of the initial overarching objectives are the following key initiatives:
■Transform our corporate and operating culture into "One Delek" through unification of purpose, vision and strategy with an emphasis on cultural sustainability.
■Transform our refining operations into the "Refinery of the Future" founded on digitization and automation, innovation and synergistic discipline.
■Develop a "New Energy" mentality focused on understanding the future of energy on a global scale and how Delek can be a leader and facilitator of positive, sustainable change in the energy industry.
Long-Term Sustainability Strategy: A Snapshot
The Overarching Objectives and Key Initiatives are integrated and interdependent, representative of the synergistic approach we are employing, and together comprise our Long-term Sustainability Strategy. To illustrate these overlapping components and their interdependence, see the illustrative snapshot of our Long-Term Sustainability Strategy below:
62 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Our Key Initiatives, which are integrated with our Overarching Objectives, also provide clear, actionable paths toward long-term sustainability, as shown below:
Long-Term Sustainability Strategy: Developing Actionable Key Initiatives, Focused Objectives and Specific Priorities
Developing a strategy focused on long-term economic and operational sustainability in a challenging and rapidly changing environment is a larger and more ambitious objective than a strategy that is simply centered on growth and return on shareholder investment in the near-term. For these reasons, it is important to understand the scalability of our strategy and what are the appropriate stages and priorities, recognizing that the inherent complexity of achieving long-term sustainability is a long game requiring both a measured, disciplined approach as well agility and flexibility to changing conditions. As a result, we are implementing our new strategic framework in intentional stages.
Stage 1 - Second Half of 2021
While this Framework is in its early phase, we have already been hard at work executing on our Stage 1 Priorities in the context of our Overarching Objectives and Key Initiatives. This progress is, in part, due to some overlap with our previous strategic objectives (thus also validating that our previous objectives were, in many ways, the right areas of focus), but also the result of the energy and commitment that our sustainability framework is generating in our organization. We selected these Stage 1 Priorities because they are all foundational to a continued progression toward achieving our overarching strategic objectives under the Long-Term Sustainability Framework. As we continue to develop future Stage Priorities, they will be designed to further advance the realization of our Key Initiatives. Furthermore, we fully expect
63 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
overlap with previous stages and that our priorities will evolve over time to align with changing circumstances and to reflect obstacles we encounter as well as our continued progress. This is an evolution, not a "one-and-done" exercise.
Stage 2 - 2022
We developed our Stage 2 activities more intentionally, in the context of the new Framework. First, we identified our Stage 2 Key Initiatives, which are a targeted subset of the Key Initiatives discussed above. We then developed Stage 2 Focused Objectives which reflect the strategic objectives we want to achieve specifically in 2022. Finally, we developed Stage 2 Specific Priorities, which represent those priorities that we believe will help us accomplish our Stage 2 Focused Objectives, and will likewise advance achievement on our overall Key Initiatives. As our approach becomes more integrated, you will see that our Focused Objectives serve cross-purposes across our Key Initiatives, and that our Specific Priorities serve cross-purposes across our Focused Objectives.
Action Plan and Timeline
The following graphic shows the overall timeline and structure of our Key Initiatives, which guide our Focused Objectives, and ultimately our Specific Priorities, for Stage 1 and Stage 2, based on our planned timeline:

Long-Term Sustainability Strategy: Stage 2 Activities Planned for 2022
We have preliminarily identified our Stage 2 Priorities, in the context of our Stage 2 Focused Objectives and Stage 2 Key Initiatives, as follows:
65 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
In addition to the Phase 1 Strategic Priorities that were identified in connection with the development of the Long-Term Sustainability Framework in the latter part of 2021, our 2021 strategic activities were also driven by the following strategic initiatives which were identified under our previous Five-Year Strategic Framework and which were aligned to our previous Core Strategic Focus Areas:
•Maintain and Continue to Enhance Our Safe Operations. Our commitment to safety has been reflected in our continuous improvement in DART (days away, restricted or transferred) and TRIR (total recordable incident rate) metrics since 2016.
•Drive Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and Cash Flow Improvement. In 2021, the company continued to deliver cost savings and implement initiatives for margin improvements through optimization.
•Develop and Utilize Systems, Processes and Technology to Improve Operations. We have increased our focus on upgrading our technologies and implement advanced systems and processes to achieve further, more structural cost reductions, operational improvements and asset optimization over the medium to longer term.
•Ongoing Commitment to ESG. We are still relatively early in our ESG journey, and we are striving for progressive improvements over time in terms of underlying performance metrics and disclosure in all ESG categories. We recently announced our first greenhouse gas emissions reductions target as we seek to align our business with the Paris Climate Accords, as well as a diversity goal for our Board of Directors composition.
•Laying the Foundation for Future Growth. After focusing mainly on improving our cash flow break-even profile through reduced discretionary capital expenditures and operating costs in 2021, we are emerging from this downturn with an improved cost structure, a healthy balance sheet and opportunities to pursue future growth. We are constantly evaluating the optimal investment options available in our various business units and comparing the potential returns of both organic and inorganic opportunities.
2021 Significant Strategic Developments/Areas of Focus
The following table highlights our 2021 Strategic Developments/Areas of Focus, with linkages to our new Long-Term Sustainability Strategy Overarching Objectives and Key Initiatives:

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Significant Known Uncertainties Impacting Delek
Aside from the market trends and the uncertainties inherent to those market drivers many of which are referenced in the 'Executive Summary' above and which are discussed at length in the 'Market Trends' section below, we have also identified certain uncertainties that we believe to be sufficiently significant to our financial results in the near term as to warrant additional discussion. We have included supplemental discussion of those uncertainties, and our efforts for mitigating them, below. However, note that this discussion is to bring additional attention to areas that have been of particular interest to management but should not be considered comprehensive of all known trends and uncertainties which may be relevant. Instead, in the context of all known trends or uncertainties that have had, or that are reasonably likely to have, a material favorable or unfavorable effect on financial results, they should be considered part of the larger discussion on market trends and uncertainties throughout our management's discussion and analysis.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic has resulted in significant economic disruption globally, including in the U.S. and specific geographic areas where we operate. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through both voluntary and mandated social distancing, curfews, shutdowns and expanded safety measures have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity which has had a significant impact on the nature and extent of travel. The COVID-19 Pandemic has had a devastating impact on the airline industry, dramatically reducing the number of domestic flights and, due to foreign travel bans and immigration restrictions abroad as well as traveler concerns over exposure, virtually eliminating international travel originating from the U.S. to many parts of the world. Additionally, the COVID-19 Pandemic has had a significant negative impact on motor vehicle activity. As a result, and particularly during 2020, we experienced a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel. Uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic has caused periodic storage constraints in the U.S. resulting from over-supply of produced oil. Additionally, significant environmental events, such as extreme weather conditions or natural disasters can impact pipeline accessibility and utilization, other supply sources, as well as demand. While in the last several months, the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine across the U.S. has led to some improved stability in the capital markets as well as improved pricing in crude oil, refined products, and related forward curves, there continues to be general economic uncertainty, and, accordingly, demand for refined product and for our logistics assets has not yet returned to normal levels. Such uncertainty has been further aggravated by the mutation of the COVID-19 virus into new variants and plateauing demand for currently available vaccines. Based on these conditions and events, downward pressure on commodity prices, crack spreads and demand remains a significant risk and could continue for the near term.
While the risk surrounding the uncertainties of the COVID-19 Pandemic appears to be lessening, they still represent risks that could impact our operations, financial condition and results of operations. We have identified the following known uncertainties resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic:
•Significant declines and/or volatility in prices of refined products we sell and the feedstocks we purchase as well as in crack spreads resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic could have a significant impact on our revenues, cost of sales, operating income and liquidity, as well to the carrying value of our long-lived or indefinite-lived assets;
•A decline in the market prices of refined products and feedstocks below the carrying value in our inventory may result in the adjustment of the value of our inventories to the lower market price and a corresponding loss on the value of our inventories (See also Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of specific statement risks);
•The decline in demand for refined product could significantly impact the demand for throughput at our refineries, unfavorably impacting operating results at our refineries, and could impact the demand for storage, which could impact our logistics segment;
•The decline in demand and margins impacting current results and forecasts could result in impairments in certain of our long-lived or indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, or have other financial statement impacts that cannot currently be anticipated (See further discussion in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K);
•A significant reduction or suspension in U.S. crude oil production could adversely affect our suppliers and sources of crude oil;
•An outbreak in one of our refineries, exacerbated by a limited pool of qualified replacements as well as quarantine protocols, could cause significant disruption in our production or, worst case, temporary idling of the facility;
•The restrictions on travel and requirements for social distancing could significantly impact the traffic at our convenience stores, particularly the demand for fuel;
•Customers of the refining segment as well as third-party customers of the logistics segment may experience financial difficulties which could interrupt the volumes ordered by those customers and/or could impact the credit worthiness of such customers and the collectability of their outstanding receivables;
•The impact of COVID-19 or protocols implemented in response to COVID-19 by key or specialty suppliers may negatively affect our ability to obtain specialty equipment or services when needed;
•Equity method investees may be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic which may increase the risk of impairment of those investments;
•Access to capital markets may be significantly impacted by the volatility and uncertainty in the oil and gas market specifically which could restrict our ability to raise funds;
67 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
•While our current liquidity needs are managed by existing facilities, sources of future liquidity needs may be impacted by the volatility in the debt market and the availability and pricing of such funds as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic; and
•The U.S. Federal Government has enacted certain stimulus and relief measures and may consider additional relief legislation. Beyond the direct impact of existing legislation on Delek in the current or prior periods (as applicable), the extent to which the provisions of the existing or any future legislation will achieve its intention to stimulate or provide relief to the greater U.S. economy and/or consumer, as well as the impact and success of such efforts, remains unknown.
Other uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic as well as global geopolitical factors may exist that have not been identified or that are not specifically listed above, and could impact our future results of operations and financial position, the nature of which and the extent to which are currently unknown. The U.S. Federal Government's passage and/or enactment of additional stimulus and relief measures, as well as their future actions may impact the extent to which the risk underlying these uncertainties are realized. To the extent these uncertainties have been identified and are believed to have an impact on our current period results of operations or financial position based on the requirements for assessing such financial statement impact under U.S. GAAP, we have considered them in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Delek's Response to Significant Uncertainties Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic
Management has actively responded to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business. Additionally, to the extent warranted, we continue to monitor the impact and implement measures to mitigate the risk. Such efforts include (but are not limited to) the following:
•Reviewing planned production throughputs at our refineries and planning for optimization of operations;
•Coordinating planned maintenance or turnaround activities with possible downtime as a result of possible reductions in throughputs;
•Searching for additional storage capacity if needed to store potential builds in crude oil or refined product inventories;
•Finding additional suppliers for key or specialty items or securing inventory or priority status with existing vendors;
•Reducing discretionary capital expenditures;
•Suspending the share repurchase program and dividend distributions until our internal parameters are met for resuming such activities;
•Taking advantage of the income and payroll tax relief afforded to us by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES") or other Pandemic relief legislation;
•Implementing regular site cleaning and disinfecting procedures;
•Adopting remote working where possible, and when immediate exposure risk warrants, and where on-site operations are required, taking appropriate safety precautions;
•Identifying alternative financing solutions as needed to enhance our access to sources of liquidity; and
•Enacting temporary cost reduction measures across the organization, including reducing contract services, reducing overtime and other employee related costs, and reducing or eliminating non-critical travel.
The most significant of these efforts to date as well as specifically identified measures that are anticipated in the near term, in terms of realized or anticipated impact on our financial results, include the following:
•For the year ended December 31, 2020 pursuant to the provisions of the CARES Act, we recognized $16.8 million of current federal income tax benefit attributable to anticipated tax refunds from net operating loss carryback to prior 35% tax rate years, and deferred $10.9 million of payroll tax payments which was and will be payable in equal installments in December 2021 and December 2022. Additionally, we recorded a current income tax receivable totaling $135.6 million and a non-current tax receivable of $20.6 million as of December 31, 2020, related to the net operating loss carryback, all of which we received in the third quarter of 2021.
•We made significant efforts to temporarily reduce our capital spending, particularly on growth and non-critical sustaining maintenance projects, and by deferring non-critical turnaround activities (for example, we are conducting "surgical strike" turnaround activities at our Tyler refinery, which allows us to defer the full turnaround until 2023). See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis, for further information.
•In light of the weak macro-economic environment, we elected to pull forward turnaround work into the fourth quarter of 2020 on certain units at the Krotz Springs refinery that was conducted on a straight-time basis. This allowed us to continue running the more profitable units of the refinery and should help improve economics toward a break-even level. We completed this turnaround work late in the first quarter 2021 and have since returned to normalized production.
•Additionally, we implemented a temporary cost reduction plan for 2021 designed to significantly reduce operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. The majority of the operating expenses reduction was attributable to the temporary unit optimization at the Krotz Spring refinery, with additional reductions arising from other efforts such as targeted budgeting around outside contractor expenses and deferral of certain non-critical, non-capitalizable maintenance activities. Furthermore, both operating and general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by a cumulative reduction in workforce, some of which were temporary.
•Finally, we elected to suspend dividends beginning in the fourth quarter 2020 in order to conserve capital. This has helped us maintain our liquidity and manage our cost of capital impacted by the Pandemic, as well as provided additional flexibility to pursue opportunities to provide value to investors with respect to our stock price, which we believe is undervalued.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The combination of these efforts had a mitigating impact on cash flows as well as our operations, which we believe has improved our liquidity positioning and operational flexibility and response in anticipation of the continued economic impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
The extent to which our future results are affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the Pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the Pandemic, and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus and any new variants. The COVID-19 Pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the Pandemic, could also exacerbate the risk factors identified in the "Risk Factors" section located in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 Pandemic may also materially adversely affect our results in a manner that is either not currently known or that we do not currently consider to be a significant risk to our business.
Regulatory Volatility
Our RINs cost and RINs Obligation (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) have been negatively impacted by increasing RINs prices during much of 2021 which resulted from the 2020 unfavorable ruling against companies previously granted the EPA's SREs under the RFS which governs RINs volume obligations for U.S. hydrocarbon refining companies, importers and blenders. Additionally, increased environmental regulatory activity in Washington, D.C. following the change in the presidential administration in January 2021 continued to put upward pressure on RIN prices. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, which was subsequently appealed and (for the first half of the year) was waiting to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, stalled the approval of 2019 SRE applications already submitted (inclusive of 2019 SRE applications for each of our four refineries) and led to the postponement of 2020 SRE applications. Additionally, because of these delays and uncertainties, the EPA issued, by Final Rule, extensions on the compliance deadline under the RFS as well as the deadline for submission of the obligated party attestation reports as of December 31, 2020 that delayed the deadlines until future periods. In late June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 10th Circuit's previous ruling regarding RINs, resulting in market optimism that the stalled SRE applications from 2019, as well as new applications for 2020, might be granted, based on the published criteria. Market expectations that at least some SRE applications may be approved and/or that the EPA may reduce certain outstanding compliance requirements, resulted in an improvement in RINs prices during the third quarter of 2021. However, this expectation was dampened by the release of a proposed rule by the EPA in December 2021 which recommended revised volumetric rates for 2020 and, for the first time, introduced proposed rates for 2021 and 2022, and proposed denial of pending SRE petitions, noting that the proposed volumetric rate changes may be sufficient to render the granting of small refinery exemptions unnecessary based on the arguably inaccurate presumption that small refineries are not unduly burdened by the cost of RINs. The December 2021 Proposed Rule is still under comment and review and has not yet been finalized. Because of the delays and uncertainties, the EPA Issued, by Final Rule in February 2022, compliance and attestation reporting deadline extensions based on a formula that begins with the first reporting deadline that is at least 60 days after the 2019 RINs Obligation compliance requirements are made effective via Final Rule, with the 2020, 2021 and 2022 deadlines to occur at each successive quarterly reporting deadline. So if the 2019 compliance requirement is finalized in June 2022, it's reporting and attestation compliance deadline would be September 1, 2022, followed by the following deadlines for subsequent RINs Obligation years: 2020 - December 1, 2022; 2021 - March 31, 2023; 2022 - June 1, 2023.
Uncertainty remains regarding the likelihood of SREs being granted as well as the potential for EPA relief from certain compliance requirements. Additionally, uncertainty remains regarding the impact that proposed EPA rules, or future revisions to proposed rules, may have on RINs prices, which impact the determination of the fair value of our Net RINs Obligation, as well as the fair value of forward RIN commitment contracts. While we cannot know the outcome of our SRE applications, Delek has a history of being granted the waivers with most grants to the Krotz Springs and El Dorado refineries. As an example, in 2018, we were granted SREs for our Tyler, Krotz Springs and El Dorado refineries. Additionally, while our current Net RINs Obligation reflects current RINs market prices as of December 31, 2021, the financial statement impact, including both the income statement and net cash impact, of any future receipt of SRE(s) or future changes to enacted Renewable Volume Obligation rates, is not determinable because of the complexity of the Net RINs Obligation and related transactions, where such financial statement impact is dependent upon the following: (1) which refineries receive exemptions and/or the extent of enacted volumetric requirement changes; (2) the composition of the specific Net RINs Obligation (in terms of the vintages of RINs we currently own versus the waived RINs Obligation) and the related market prices at the date each exemption is granted or volumetric requirement change is enacted; (3) the composition of our RINs forward commitment contracts that may be settled or positions closed as a result of any exemption or enacted change and the related gains or losses; (4) the settlement requirements of related RINs product financing arrangements; and (5) the quantity of and dates at which excess RINs can be sold and the sales price (see also Note 11, Note 12 and Note 19 as well as our related accounting policies related to RINs included in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We note that our total gross RINs Obligation for 2020 (which is the most recent period for which volumetric requirements have been enacted), for all four refineries, was approximately 340 million RINs, across all RIN categories. While receipt of any SREs could result in significant benefit, both in terms of income statement effect and cash flows, other enacted regulatory changes could impact our financial results in ways that we cannot currently anticipate.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Delek's Response to Significant Uncertainties Associated with Regulatory Volatility
As discussed above, RFS activities and Renewable Volume Obligation requirements, and their impact on RIN prices, represent a significant risk which has, and could continue to, materially impact our financial results in ways that are currently uncertain. Our efforts to mitigate this risk include the following:
•Aggressively pursuing small refinery exemptions for all four of our refineries;
◦Immediately following the favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2021, we undertook efforts to prepare 2020 SRE applications for our refineries and we submitted them in August 2021. We believe that RINs do significantly impact the crack spread capture at our refineries and therefore the original intent of SREs is still applicable and, likewise, that SREs should be granted to us. Furthermore, Delek has a history of being granted the waivers. Because EPA failed to decide Delek’s pending 2019 SRE petitions within the statutorily prescribed 90-day period, Delek filed suit against the Agency in federal district court in the District of Columbia. That case remains pending before the court.
•Actively monitoring EPA rule-making and RFS actions regarding volumetric requirements, remittance due dates, and deferral opportunities in order to make decisions about RINs inventory;
•Proactively monitoring our Net RINs Obligation position (inclusive of our RINs inventory portfolio), by vintage and RIN category, in order to make decisions about the purchase and sale of RINs, based on both a current and forward basis, and considering the risk of floating versus fixed pricing; and
•Incorporating into our strategic priorities activities designed to enhance incremental crack spread capture so that the impact of high RIN prices or RINs price volatility is diminished.
While there continues to be risk around the fair value of RINs Obligation that we incur and the RINs cost we recognize in our results of operations, we believe that our risk management activities around RINs are comprehensive. That said, because the RINs market is subject to factors outside of our control, there will continue to be risk that RINs cost could adversely affect our financial results. See additional discussion of the effect of RINs prices and volatility on our refining margins in the "Market Trends" section below.
Climate Change
Increasingly unstable environmental conditions and spontaneous extreme weather events are making it costlier and more difficult for oil and gas companies to operate in certain environments. Consequently, climate-change, and related current and proposed regulations, are directly and indirectly impacting industry bottom lines globally and in specific geographic areas where we operate. Current and proposed climate-change and environmental regulations, laws and government policies affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. There continues to be significant uncertainty around coming regulatory requirements, not just from an operational perspective, but also around what reporting requirements may be, as well as the associated cost. The SEC is currently considering its requirements for ESG reporting in the near term, which may include requirements that independent assurance be obtained and reported for ESG disclosures, similar to financial statement audit reports.
Delek's Response to Significant Uncertainties Associated with Climate Change
We remain committed to complying with all regulations, laws and government policies designed to curb the growing climate-change crisis. In 2021, the Company announced goals to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 34% through emission reductions and carbon offsets. This goal is aligned with both the IEA’s SDS and the Paris Accord’s goal of limiting warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Using 2012 as our baseline, we plan to pursue the reductions via a combination of steps including, but not limited to: energy-efficient operational improvements; transitioning some refinery production away from transportation fuels and towards chemicals; renewable power purchases, when feasible, and offsets, when necessary; and previously executed facility shutdowns that were later divested Our pledge is the first step towards a long-term roadmap which we are seeking to align with the SBTI, to move Delek firmly in the direction of the carbon-neutral operating environment as envisioned by the Paris Accords.
We also continue to monitor the activities of the SEC as it works towards issuing reporting compliance rules around ESG and climate change, which includes consideration of framework and/or standards introduced by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB"), so that we may ensure timely compliance with requirements as well as meaningful disclosure for our investors and stakeholders.
Talent Retention
It is widely reported that post-Pandemic talent retention has become a very real risk for companies that are looking forward to emerging from Pandemic conditions. According to a 2021 report by Achievers Workforce Institute, 52% of employees in North America will look for a new job in the near future, leading many to refer to the phenomenon as a “turnover tsunami” or the "Great Resignation." The Pandemic has caused changes in consumer behavior, in travel and also in the way we work. It has triggered a fundamental shift in the way many people view their lives and their relationships with employers, in a time when concern for the health and well-being of loved ones has been paramount. Additionally, the job market has changed. COVID-19-related fatalities have taken a toll on the talent pool, and the remaining workforce have shifted their views of what's important. Encouraged/forced retirement and workforce reductions during the height of the Pandemic pushed workers into different roles, while health concerns, flexibility needs and the success of remote working optionality have changed the way employees view work. Additionally, changing consumer behavior and demands during the Pandemic have fueled certain industries and decimated others, creating new demand for certain jobs and changing the market compensation for many.
As we look to 2022, we have identified certain key contributors to post-Pandemic talent retention risk which include the following:
70 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
•Highly Competitive Labor Markets - in many of the markets where we operate, we recognize that there turnover rates are at historic highs, combined with low unemployment rates;
•Voluntary Underemployment or Unemployment - many workers have been forced into under- or unemployment during the Pandemic, and either have successfully adjusted to it or continue to have concerns about health and safety and/or caring for family members; and
•Evolving Employee Value Proposition Expectations - Rising wages and new expectations for working flexibility favor employers who are culturally responsive.
We have also identified the following potential consequences of failing to adequately to address the risk around retaining talent:
•Strategic Transformation Failure - failure to recruit and retain employees for roles necessary for specific organizational transformation objectives can contribute to delay or failure of the transformation;
•Cultural Disruption/Erosion - failure to retain team builders and talent with institutional knowledge can cause cultural disruption/erosion, leading to employees that feel less invested in the success of their teams and the company, and contributing to the risk of escalating turnover; and
•Loss of Agility Required for Sustainability - in a rapidly evolving economic landscape, agility is often dependent upon the talent and institutional knowledge of your employee force, and loss of that talent and knowledge can impact a company's ability to remain competitive and to achieve or maintain long-term sustainability.
Because of the pervasiveness of the risk, and that it is not specific to Delek, there remains significant uncertainty about the extent to which we may experience post-Pandemic talent attrition, and how workforce demands and expectations may continue to evolve on both a macro and micro level. Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty as to the impact of post-Pandemic talent attrition, in terms of the specific talent and institutional knowledge that may be lost and how that could impact our strategic transformation activities, our culture and our ability to remain agile. Failure to appropriately mitigate this risk, ultimately, could impair our long-term sustainability.
Delek's Response to Significant Uncertainties Associated with Post-Pandemic Talent Retention
We recognize that talent retention is a significant risk to the Company post-Pandemic, for all the reasons discussed above. Our efforts to mitigate this risk include the following:
•We have engaged consultants to benchmark our overall Enterprise Risk Management framework, and as a result, we have:
◦Identified Post-Pandemic Talent Retention ("PPTR") as one of the most critical emerging risks facing the Company; and
◦Identified the key drivers or post-Pandemic talent retention risk and potential consequences
•We have recently established a PPTR Task Force which has been charged with the following:
◦Drilling down on the potential consequences of failing to appropriately manage PPTR identified above and identify underlying drivers and risks specific to Delek;
◦Ranking each identified driver/risk to determine priority for mitigation activities; and
◦Identifying action plans for the mitigation activities, based on priorities
These efforts are incremental to our existing human capital programs, and are specifically designed to address the risks presented by the changing environment. Additionally, the PPTR Task Force is recently established, and its function and responsibilities will continue to evolve over time. That said, because the PPTR risk is subject to certain factors outside of our control, there will continue to be risk that our PPTR will not be sufficiently successful and that resulting turnover could indirectly result in an adverse effect on our financial results.
Other Significant Events
During February 2021, the Company experienced a severe weather event ("Winter Storm Uri"), at all the refineries, resulting in units being temporarily shut down and damages being incurred to parts of the facilities due to extreme freezing conditions. Due to the extreme freezing conditions, and despite the acceleration of planned and ongoing turnaround work at the El Dorado and Krotz Spring refineries (which provided some mitigation), we experienced reduced throughputs at our refineries as there was a disruption in the crude supply, increases in natural gas costs, as well as damages to various units at our refineries requiring additional operating and capital expenditures. Additionally, on February 27, 2021, our El Dorado refinery experienced a fire in its Penex unit, in which six Delek employees were injured. Our on-site emergency response team, with the assistance of the El Dorado Fire Department, extinguished the fire, and we immediately began to monitor the air quality within the refinery and the community. The incident was investigated by the OSHA and Chemical Safety Board and resulted in operational disruptions as well as property and casualty damages.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have recognized approximately $30.9 million ($23.9 million after-tax) of insurance recoveries related to property and casualty claims relating to the winter storm and the fire, $13.4 million of which related to replacement cost coverage on property losses and which helps offset corresponding capital expenditures, and the remaining $17.5 million of which relates to repairs and other operating expenses incurred in connection with our property and casualty damages. Additionally, during the first half of 2021, the fire and freeze events caused us to experience operational disruptions that significantly affected our results. While we cannot know what our EBITDA would have been, we submitted business interruption insurance claims for covered economic losses based on our insurance policies. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2021, we have recognized $9.9 million ($7.7 million after-tax) of business interruption insurance recoveries, which were recorded in other operating income on the consolidated statement of income. There are additional property and casualty claims, as well as business interruption claims, that are outstanding and still pending which are expected to be recognized in future quarters.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Market Trends
Our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, including, but not limited to, crude oil, gasoline, distillate fuel, biofuels, natural gas and electricity, among others. Historically, the impact of commodity price volatility on our refining margins (as defined in our "Non-GAAP Measures" in MD&A Item 7.), specifically as it relates to the price of crude oil as compared to the price of refined products and timing differences in the movements of those prices (subject to our inventory costing methodology), as well as location differentials, may be favorable or unfavorable compared to peers. Additionally, our refining margin profitability is impacted by regulatory factors, including the cost of RINs.
As we reflect on the macro environment in 2021,the economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, both globally and domestically. While the effects of recurrent COVID-19 variant mutations caused fluctuating travel restrictions, global chip shortages, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures in multiple parts of the world, these effects were generally less pronounced than in 2020, which was characterized by economic lockdowns and pervasive uncertainty about the viability and availability of vaccines. In the last several months, the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine across the U.S., as well as stabilizing trade relations with global partners, has led to improved stability in the U.S. capital markets and certain industry sectors. Crude oil markets experienced increasing levels of demand, which combined with intermittent constraints on supply, translated into a strong oil price recovery. We saw this in the recovery of WTI, which is the largest component of our crude slate, with an average price per barrel of $77.33 in the fourth quarter of 2021 (for Cushing barrels) compared to an average price of $42.63 in the fourth quarter of 2020. This translated into improved crack spreads and increases in CBOB gasoline prices, where the average 5-3-2 crack spread increased from $7.83 to $17.51 and where CBOB gasoline prices increased from an average of $1.17 to $2.22 in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. These increases reflect recoveries of prices to pre-Pandemic levels. That said, our refining operations are heavily dependent on Midland crude, because of our geographic footprint and gathering activities in Midland and surrounding Permian area. Thus, an unfavorable Midland differential compared to Cushing on WTI crude oil will have a negative impact on our results. The Midland differential was at an unfavorable premium for the latter half of 2020 through the third quarter 2021, and has just now flattened to near zero in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Other conditions impacting the macro-economic environment during 2021 included several events of unexpected severe weather. Violent storms, wildfires and extreme temperatures across the U.S. impacted travel, disrupted supply chain infrastructure and resulted in consumer losses of property and, in some cases, lives, which put pressure on the economy. Winter Storm Uri, which crippled much of Texas in February of 2021, impacted much of our network in the Permian Basin and Gulf Coast region, causing pipeline disruptions, power outages and constrained consumer travel. Additionally, 2021 ushered in both improvements in COVID-19 testing and vaccine distribution, but also a shift in regulatory sentiment. The changing regulatory landscape has renewed industry focus on climate change concerns and resulted in an acceleration of ESG efforts. While it has inspired expansion of technological investment in lower carbon-emission technologies such as renewables, green and blue hydrogen energy, as well as carbon capture, utilization and storage (“CCUS”) projects, it has also translated into delays in the EPA’s RFS activities with respect to proposing and finalizing volumetric requirements for Renewable Volume Obligations and granting small refinery exemptions, which in turn has had a significant impact on the prices of RINs. Unfavorable RINs prices can impact the capture of crack spreads, and can be especially impactful to small refineries, and we felt the squeeze of high RINs prices in our refining segment, particularly with respect to our Krotz Springs and El Dorado refineries.
The cost of energy also affects our macro-economic environment. During 2021, U.S. natural gas prices saw a brief spike in February during Winter Storm Uri, which strained natural gas supply and distribution and, likewise, the electricity markets in Texas and Oklahoma. Throughout most of the remainder of 2021, domestic natural gas demand outpaced growth in supply and contributed to sustained increases in natural gas prices. Additional factors, including increased exports triggered by unusually high international gas prices, as well as critical pipeline outages and the prices and availability of substitute fuels for power generation, put additional upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices. Domestically, U.S. Henry Hub natural gas prices rose dramatically to an average $3.86 per million British thermal units on a quarterly basis in 2021, up from $1.86 in 2020. International natural gas pricing was volatile despite following the traditional seasonal pattern, swinging from Pandemic-driven lows in 2020 to record highs around the world. The spike in natural gas prices in the first quarter of 2021 relating to Winter Storm Uri had a significant impact on our refining contribution margin, and the high natural gas prices continued to impact our crack spread capture for the remainder 2021. That said, we successfully employed commercial strategies to help mitigate the risk of extreme volatility in energy costs during much of the year, following that initial spike.
Looking Ahead to 2022
As we look ahead to 2022, we expect the global economic environment to continue to support growth, though both growth and stability may be constrained by building inflationary pressures. In February 2022, oil prices have surged toward $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 which has the effect of both hampering growth and driving inflation. There is an expectation that the U.S. Federal Reserve and fellow central banks may make rate changes to combat the rising inflation. At the same time, inflation hits companies and consumers with higher costs for essentials like food, transportation and heat. In fact, the International Monetary Fund recently raised its forecast for global consumer price increases to an average 3.9% in advanced economies this year, up from 2.3%, and 5.9% in emerging and developing nations.
Additionally, military actions by Russia towards the Ukraine are causing significant consternation among NATO countries and across the global landscape, and could result in sanctions on Russia that could disrupt the global markets in ways that cannot yet be anticipated, but that could reduce Russian supply and create demand for domestic crude and refined product, and could also impact natural gas exports and domestic prices. The uncertainties surrounding future oil supply are compounded by conflicts in the Middle East, which resulted in damaged fuel storage

Management's Discussion and Analysis
facilities in Abu Dhabi and increases in oil production in countries such as Libya and Kazakhstan in response to blockades and other disruptions. Concerns about low oil inventories and potential supply disruptions have outweighed downward price pressure from China’s announcement that it will release crude oil from its national strategic stockpiles.
All of these contributing factors, combined with upward price pressures on natural gas, liquified natural gas ("LNG"), and coal energy are expected to increase the demand for hydrocarbon-based energy in 2022. Likewise, we expect continued improvements in crack spreads, driven by increased demand. Absent government intervention, industry analysts expect the Brent-WTI differential to be favorable for domestic exports in 2022, including the U.S. Gulf Coast region. However, the Midland-Cushing differential is not expected to improve significantly in 2022, due to overbuilt pipeline capacity despite an expectation for depleted Cushing inventory. However, significant export developments and other factors could quickly shift differentials to be more favorable to our Permian-heavy positioning. Meanwhile, in December 2021, the EPA proposed a rule to revise 2021 Renewable Volume Requirements and to suggest rates for 2022 and 2023. Additionally, the EPA has proposed views that such changes may be sufficient to render the granting of small refinery exemptions unnecessary, based on the arguably inaccurate presumption that small refineries are not unduly burdened by the cost of RINs. In any case, we will continue to pursue the small refinery exemptions. Furthermore, the establishment of volumes for two years may stabilize RIN prices, though they may continue to be higher than historical averages.
See below for further discussion on how certain key market trends impact our operating results.
WTI crude oil represents the largest component of our crude slate at all of our refineries, and can be sourced through our gathering channels or optimization efforts from Midland, Texas or Cushing, Oklahoma or other locations.The table below reflects the quarterly average prices of WTI Midland and WTI Cushing crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years. As shown in the historical graph, WTI Midland crude prices can be favorable or unfavorable as compared to WTI Cushing. We manage our supply chain risk to ensure that we have the barrels to meet our crude slate consumption plan for each month through gathering supply contracts and throughput agreements on various strategic pipelines, some of which include those where we hold equity method investments. We manage market price risk on crude oil through financial derivative hedges, in accordance with our risk management strategies.
The chart below illustrates the average quarterly price of WTI Midland and WTI Cushing over the past three years.
73 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
As U.S. crude oil production has increased over recent years, domestic refiners have benefited from the discount for WTI Cushing compared to Brent, a global benchmark crude. This generally leads to higher margins in our refineries, as refined product prices are influenced by Brent crude prices and the majority of our crude supply is WTI-linked. Because of our positioning in the Permian basin, including our access to significant sources of WTI Midland crude through our gathering system, we are even further benefited by discounts for WTI Midland/WTI Cushing differentials. When these discounts shrink or become premiums, our reliance on WTI-linked crude pricing, and specifically WTI Midland crude, can negatively impact our refining margins. Conversely, as these price discounts widen, so does our competitive advantage, created specifically by our access to WTI Midland crude sourced through our gathering systems.
The chart below illustrates the key differentials impacting our refining operations, including WTI Cushing to Brent, WTI Midland to WTI Cushing, and LLS to WTI Cushing over the past three years.
We are impacted by refined product prices in two ways: (1) in terms of the prices we are able to sell our refined product for in our refining segment, and (2) in terms of the cost to acquire the refined products to meet Refining production shortfalls (e.g., when we have outages), or to acquire refined fuel products we sell to our wholesale customers in our logistics segment and at our convenience stores in our retail segment. These prices largely depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation.
Our refineries produce the following products:

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The charts below illustrate the quarterly average prices of Gulf Coast Gasoline (CBOB), HSD and ULSD over the past three years.
Crack spreads are used as benchmarks for predicting and evaluating a refinery's product margins by measuring the difference between the market price of feedstocks/crude oil and the resultant refined products. Generally, a crack spread represents the approximate refining margin resulting from processing one barrel of crude oil into its outputs, generally gasoline and diesel fuel.
The table below reflects the quarterly average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 ULSD, 3-2-1 ULSD and 2-1-1 HSD/LLS crack spreads for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years. As the chart illustrates, the 3-2-1 crack spread has consistently outperformed the 5-3-2 and the 2-1-1 crack spreads. When market conditions consist of near-capacity throughputs and no significant outages, our Big Spring refinery, whose benchmark is the 3-2-1 crack spread, should outperform our other refineries in terms of refining margin, which are benchmarked against either the 5-3-2 or the 2-1-1 crack spreads.
75 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Environmental regulations and the political environment continue to affect our refining margins in the form of volatility in the price of RINs. On a consolidated basis, we work to balance our RINs Obligation in order to minimize the effect of RINs prices on our results. While we obtain RINs in our refining and logistics segments through our ethanol and biodiesel blending and generate RINs through biodiesel production, our refining segment still must purchase additional RINs to satisfy its obligations. Additionally, our ability to obtain RINs through blending is limited by our refined product slate, blending capabilities and market constraints. The cost to purchase these additional RINs is a significant cash outflow for our business. Additionally, increases in the market prices of RINs generally adversely affect our results of operations through changes in fair value to our existing RINs Obligation, to the extent we do not have offsetting RINs inventory on hand or effective economic hedges through net forward purchase commitments. RINs prices are highly sensitive to regulatory and political influence and conditions, and therefore often do not correlate to movements in crude oil prices, refined product prices or crack spreads. Furthermore, RINs prices are impacted by market expectations regarding whether the EPA may grant SREs. The unfavorable 2020 SRE judicial rulings, as well as the changes in regulatory sentiment following the presidential administration change, have caused significant increases in RINs prices to all-time highs in 2021. Because of the volatility in RINs prices, it is not possible to predict future RINs cost with certainty, and movements in RINs prices can have significant and unanticipated adverse effects on our refining margins that are outside of our control.
The chart below illustrates the volatility in RINs over the past three years.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Energy costs are a significant element of our Refining contribution margin and can significantly impact our ability to capture crack spreads, with natural gas representing the largest component. Natural gas prices are driven by supply-side factors such as amount of natural gas production, level of natural gas in storage and import and export activity, while demand-side factors include variability of weather, economic growth and the availability and price of other fuels. Refiners and other large-volume fuel consumers may be more or less susceptible to volatility in natural gas prices depending on their consumption levels as well as their capabilities to switch to more economical sources of fuel/energy. Additionally, geographic location of facilities make consumers vulnerable to price differentials of natural gas available at different supply hubs. Within Delek’s geographic footprint, we source the majority of our natural gas from the Gulf Coast, and secondarily from the Permian, coinciding with the physical locations of our refineries. We manage our risk around natural gas prices by entering into variable and fixed-price supply contracts in both the Gulf and Permian Basin or by entering into derivative hedges based on forecasted consumption and forward curve prices, as appropriate, in accordance with our risk policy.
The charts below illustrate the quarterly average prices of Waha (Permian Basin) and Henry Hub (Gulf Coast) over the past three years.

Summary Financial and Other Information
The following table provides summary financial data for Delek (in millions):
(1) This information is presented at a summary level for your reference. See the Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail regarding our results of operations and net loss per share.
(2 ) For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an immaterial cumulative correction relating to prior periods to capitalize manufacturing overhead costs that should have been included in refining finished goods totaling $21.5 million. The impact of the balance sheet error correction would not have been material to the prior periods presented and is not material to total inventory or to beginning retained earnings. Of that amount, $14.0 million was recognized as a reduction of operating expenses and $7.5 million was recognized as a reduction of depreciation in the refining segment.
We report operating results in three reportable segments:
•Refining
•Logistics
•Retail
Decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of operating performance are made based on this segmentation. Management measures the operating performance of each of its reportable segments based on the segment contribution margin.
Results of Operations
Consolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Loss
Consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $170.5 million compared to $570.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Consolidated net loss attributable to Delek for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $203.5 million, or $(2.75) per basic share, compared to $608.0 million, or $(8.26) per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Explanations for significant drivers impacting net loss as compared to the comparable period of the prior year are discussed in the sections below.
Net Revenues
We generated net revenues of $10,648.2 million and $7,301.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $3,346.4 million, or 45.8%. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the following:
•in our refining segment, increases in the average price of U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline of 85.2%, ULSD of 69.5%, and HSD of 65.1%;
•in our logistics segment, increases in the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold in our West Texas marketing operations, as well increased revenues associated with agreements executed in the year 2020, partially offset by decreased throughputs primarily due to the impact of Winter Storm Uri; and
•in our retail segment, increases in fuel sales primarily attributable to a 42.4% increase in average price charged per gallon sold.

Total Operating Costs and Expenses
Cost of Materials and Other
Cost of materials and other was $9,739.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6,841.2 million for 2020, an increase of $2,898.4 million, or 42.4%. The net increase in cost of materials and other primarily related to the following:
•an increase in the cost of crude oil feedstocks at the refineries, including a 70.7% increase in the average cost of WTI Cushing crude oil and a 71.3% increase in the average cost of WTI Midland crude oil;
•increases in average RINs costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020;
•increases in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold, partially offset by decreases in the average volumes of gasoline and diesel sold in our West Texas marketing operations; and
•an increase in retail fuel cost of materials and other primarily attributable to a 51.6% increase in average cost per gallon sold.
Such increases were partially offset by the following:
•an increase in commodity hedging gains to a loss of $51.7 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 from a loss of $87.5 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020;
•the benefit (expense) of $22.3 millions related to the change in pre-tax inventory valuation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(29.2) millions recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) were $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $559.8 million in 2020, an increase of $35.8 million, or 6.4%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:
•an increase in variable expenses primarily associated with higher natural gas costs during the February 2021 severe freezing conditions that affected most of the regions where we operate and higher natural gas pricing during the third quarter of 2021; and
•increases in employee and outside services costs in our logistics segment due to terminating certain cost cutting measures previously implemented in response to the Pandemic.
Such increases were partially offset by the following:
•a one-time favorable adjustment of $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2021 to reflect the cumulative adjustment to capitalize manufacturing overhead in refining finished goods inventory.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $229.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $248.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $18.9 million, or 7.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:
•a decrease in employee expenses partially due to additional severance costs incurred in prior year and suspension of matching contributions to our 401(k) plan for the first half of 2021 while the plan was still in place during the year ended December 31, 2020; and
•a decrease in contract services due to additional legal and consulting services associated with the drop downs in prior year and cost reduction measures.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) was $264.6 million and $267.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 1.1%.
Other Operating Income, Net
Other operating income, net was $50.6 million and $13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $37.5 million, primarily due to following:
•a gain of $23.3 million from property and casualty and business interruption insurance recoveries associated with losses incurred from Winter Storm Uri and the El Dorado fire; and
•a $21.8 million increase in gains from our trading derivatives
Such increase was partially offset by $10.8 million gain on the underlying commodity related tie the Strategic Petroleum Reserve financial asset during the prior year period.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Non-Operating Expenses, Net
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $137.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $129.0 million for 2020, an increase of $8.2 million, or 6.4% primarily due to the following:
•an increase in net average borrowings outstanding (including the obligations under the supply and offtake agreements which have an associated interest charge) of approximately $80.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 (calculated as a simple average of beginning borrowings/obligations and ending borrowings/obligations for the period) compared to the year ended December 31, 2020; and
•an increase in the average effective interest rate of 0.16% during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (where effective interest rate is calculated as interest expense divided by the net average borrowings/obligations outstanding).
Results from Equity Method Investments
We recognized income from equity method investments of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $12.0 million. This decrease was primarily driven by the following:
•decrease in income from our logistics' equity method investments due to lower volumes as the impact of the February 2021 Winter Storm Uri was pervasive across all of our equity method investments' pipeline systems; and
•a decrease in income from our investment in W2W Holdings LLC to a loss of $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 from a loss of $8.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a receivable of $27.5 million, $20.9 million of which is included as a gain in other income, related to payment to be received from a loan buy-out agreement between Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC and the Company. Refer to Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a gain of $56.8 million on the sale of our non-operating refinery located in Bakersfield, California. See Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Income Taxes
Income tax benefit decreased $130.2 million resulting in net benefit of $62.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period for 2020, primarily driven by the following:
•pre-tax loss of $233.0 million compared to $763.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively;
•2020 federal net operating loss carryback to a prior 35% tax rate year creating a 14% rate arbitrage and $16.8 million benefit in 2020;
•the reversal of a valuation allowance attributable to book-tax basis differences in partnership investments reported as a discrete benefit in the first quarter of 2020, versus a net increase in valuation allowance on certain state tax attributes in 2021; offset by
• exclusion of impairment of goodwill expense in 2020 which reduced taxable benefit.
Refer to Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The tables and charts below set forth certain information concerning our refining segment operations ($ in millions, except per barrel amounts):
(1) As of December 31, 2021, we recorded an immaterial cumulative correction relating to prior periods to capitalize manufacturing overhead costs that should have been included in refining finished goods totaling $21.5 million . The impact of the balance sheet error correction resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, and would not have been material to the prior periods presented.
Factors Impacting Refining Profitability
Our profitability in the refining segment is substantially determined by the difference between the cost of the crude oil feedstocks we purchase and the price of the refined products we sell, referred to as the "crack spread", "refining margin" or "refined product margin". Refining margin is used as a metric to assess a refinery's product margins against market crack spread trends, where "crack spread" is a measure of the difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products and is a commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in refining margins.
The cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined petroleum products we ultimately sell from our refineries depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes, local, domestic and foreign political affairs, global conflict, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Other significant factors that influence our results in the refining segment include operating costs (particularly the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity), seasonal factors, refinery utilization rates and planned or unplanned maintenance activities or turnarounds. Moreover, while the fluctuations in the cost of crude oil are typically reflected in the prices of light refined products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, the price of other residual products, such as asphalt, coke, carbon black oil and LPG are less likely to move in parallel with crude cost. This could cause additional pressure on our realized margin during periods of rising or falling crude oil prices.
Additionally, our margins are impacted by the pricing differentials of the various types and sources of crude oil we use at our refineries and their relation to product pricing. Our crude slate is predominantly comprised of WTI crude oil. Therefore, favorable differentials of WTI compared to other crude will favorably impact our operating results, and vice versa. Additionally, because of our gathering system presence in the Midland area and the significant source of crude specifically from that region into our network, a widening of the WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread will favorably influence the operating margin for our refineries. Alternatively, a narrowing of this differential will have an adverse effect on our operating margins. Global product prices are influenced by the price of Brent which is a global benchmark crude. Global product prices influence product prices in the U.S. As a result, our refineries are influenced by the spread between Brent and WTI Midland. The Brent less WTI Midland spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of WTI Midland crude oil. A widening of the spread between Brent and WTI Midland will favorably influence our refineries' operating margins. Also, the Krotz Springs refinery is influenced by the spread between Brent and LLS. The Brent less LLS spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent and the average per barrel price of LLS crude oil. A discount in LLS relative to Brent will favorably influence the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin.
Finally, Refining contribution margin is impacted by regulatory costs associated with the cost of RINs as well as energy costs, including the cost of natural gas. In periods of unfavorable regulatory sentiment or uncertainty regarding the possibility of SREs, RINs prices can increase at higher rates than crack spreads, or even when crack spreads are declining. This can be particularly impactful on smaller refineries, where the operating cost structure does not have as much scalability as larger refineries. Additionally, volatility in energy costs, which are captured in our operating expenses and impact our Refining contribution margin, can significantly impact our ability to capture crack spreads, with natural gas representing the most significant component. Within Delek’s geographic footprint, we source the majority of our natural gas from the Gulf Coast, and secondarily from the Permian, and we do not currently have the capability at our refineries to switch our energy consumption to utilize alternative sources of fuel. For this reason, unfavorable Gulf Coast (Henry Hub) differentials can impact our crack spread capture.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The cost to acquire the refined fuel products we sell to our wholesale customers in our logistics segment and at our convenience stores in our retail segment largely depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation.
In addition to the above, it continues to be a strategic and operational objective to manage price and supply risk related to crude oil that is used in refinery production, and to develop strategic sourcing relationships. For that purpose, from a pricing perspective, we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil and ethanol, future sales of refined products or to fix margins on future production. We also enter into future commitments to purchase or sell RINs at fixed prices and quantities, which are used to manage the costs of our credits for commitments required by the EPA to blend biofuels into fuel products ("RINs Obligation"). Additionally, from a sourcing perspective, we often enter into purchase and sale contracts with vendors and customers or take physical or financial commodity positions for crude oil that may not be used immediately in production, but that may be used to manage the overall supply and availability of crude expected to ultimately be needed for production and/or to meet minimum requirements under strategic pipeline arrangements, and also to optimize and hedge availability risks associated with crude that we ultimately expect to use in production. Such transactions are inherently based on certain assumptions and judgments made about the current and possible future availability of crude. Therefore, when we take physical or financial positions for optimization purposes, our intent is generally to take offsetting positions in quantities and at prices that will advance these objectives while minimizing our positional and financial statement risk. However, because of the volatility of the market in terms of pricing and availability, it is possible that we may have material positions with timing differences or, more rarely, that we are unable to cover a position with an offsetting position as intended. Such differences could have a material impact on the classification of resulting gains/losses, assets or liabilities, and could also significantly impact refining contribution margin.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Included in the refinery statistics above are the following inter-refinery and sales to other segments:
(1)For our Tyler and El Dorado refineries, we compare our per barrel refining product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread consisting of WTI Cushing crude, U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB and U.S. Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil (ultra low sulfur diesel). For our Big Spring refinery, we compare our refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread consisting of WTI Cushing crude, Gulf Coast 87 Conventional gasoline and Gulf Coast ultra low sulfur diesel, and for our Krotz Springs refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread consisting of LLS crude oil, Gulf Coast 87 Conventional gasoline and U.S. Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur diesel). The Tyler refinery's crude oil input is primarily WTI Midland and East Texas, while the El Dorado refinery's crude input is primarily a combination of WTI Midland, local Arkansas and other domestic inland crude oil. The Big Spring refinery’s crude oil input is primarily comprised of WTS and WTI Midland. The Krotz Springs refinery’s crude oil input is primarily comprised of LLS and WTI Midland.

Refining Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Revenues
Net revenues for the refining segment increased $4,138.3 million, or 71.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the following:
•increase in the average price of U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline of 85.2%, ULSD of 69.5%, and HSD of 65.1%; and
•increases in sales volumes of refined and purchased product of 0.7 million and 1.6 million barrels, respectively.
Net revenues included sales to our retail segment of $355.7 million and $220.0 million, sales to our logistics segment of $321.9 million and $203.8 million and sales to our other segment of $110.1 million and $30.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We eliminate this intercompany revenue in consolidation.
Cost of Materials and Other
Cost of materials and other increased $3,694.0 million, or 64.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the following:
•increases in the cost of WTI Cushing crude oil, from an average of $39.89 per barrel to an average of $68.11, or 70.7%;
•increases in the cost of WTI Midland crude oil, from an average of $40.02 per barrel to an average of $68.55, or 71.3%; and
•increases in RINs costs from an average cost per RIN of $0.44 and $0.64 for ethanol and biodiesel RINs, respectively during the year ended December 31, 2020 to an average of $1.31 and $1.50 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
These increases were partially offset by the following:
•the benefit (expense) of $23.6 million related to the change in pre-tax inventory valuation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(29.4) million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.
86 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Our refining segment purchases finished product from our logistics segment and has multiple service agreements with our logistics segment which, among other things, require the refining segment to pay terminalling and storage fees based on the throughput volume of crude and finished product in the logistics segment pipelines and the volume of crude and finished product stored in the logistics segment storage tanks, subject to MVCs. These costs and fees were $367.9 million and $339.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We eliminate these intercompany fees in consolidation.
Refining Margin
Refining margin increased by $444.3 million, or 615.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, with a refining margin percentage of 5.2% as compared to 1.2% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily driven by the following:
•a 106.8% improvement in the 5-3-2 crack spread (the primary measure for the Tyler refinery and El Dorado refinery), a 104.5% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread (the primary measure for the Big Spring refinery), and a 123.9% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread (the primary measure for the Krotz Springs refinery); and
•an increase in reversal benefit of inventory valuation reserve during the year 2021 compared to the prior year period.
These increases were partially offset by the following:
•increases in average RINs costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $31.4 million, or 7.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:
•an increase in utilities costs primarily associated with higher natural gas costs during the February 2021 related to Winter Storm Uri and pricing increases in the later half of 2021; and
•an increase in catalyst costs due to increased production at the refineries.
Such increases were offset by the following:
•a one-time favorable adjustment of $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2021 to reflect the cumulative adjustment to capitalize manufacturing overhead in refining finished goods inventory.
Contribution Margin
Contribution margin increased by $412.9 million, or a 6.5% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the following:
•an increase in refining margin primarily driven by an overall increase in the average crack spreads, partially offset by higher percentage of purchased product sold and increase in average RINs cost.
Such increase was offset by the following:
•an increase in operating expenses of $31.4 million, or 7.8%.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The table below sets forth certain information concerning our logistics segment operations ($ in millions, except per barrel amounts):
(1) Excludes jet fuel and petroleum coke.
(2) Consists of terminalling throughputs at our Tyler, Big Spring, Big Sandy and Mount Pleasant, Texas terminals, El Dorado and North Little Rock, Arkansas terminals and Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee terminals.
(3) Throughputs for the Permian Gathering System and the Plains Connection System are for the approximately 275 days we owned the assets following the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition effective March 31, 2020.
Logistics revenue is largely based on fixed-fee or tariff rates charged for throughput volumes running through our logistics network, where many of those volumes are contractually protected by MVCs. To the extent that our logistics volumes are not subject to MVCs, our Logistics revenue may be negatively impacted in periods where are customers are experiencing economic pressures or reductions in demand for their products. Additionally, certain of our throughput arrangements contain deficiency credit provisions that may require us to defer excess MVC fees collected over actual throughputs to apply toward MVC deficiencies in future periods. With respect to our equity method investments in pipeline joint ventures, our earnings from those investments (which is based on our pro rata ownership percentage of the joint venture's recognized net income or loss) are directly impacted by the operations of those joint ventures. Items impacting the joint venture net income (loss) may include (but is not limited to) the following: long-term throughput contractual arrangements and related MVCs and, in some cases, deficiency credit provisions; the demand for walk-up nominations; applicable rates or tariffs; long-lived asset or other impairments assessed at the joint venture level; and pipeline releases or other contingent liabilities. With respect to our West Texas marketing activities, our profitability is dependent upon the cost of landed product versus the rack price of refined product sold. Our logistics segment is generally protected from commodity price risk because inventory is purchased and then immediately sold at the rack.

Logistics Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Revenues
Net revenues increased by $137.5 million, or 24.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by the following:
•increased revenues associated with agreements executed in connection with Permian Gathering System and Delek Trucking acquisitions, which were effective March 31, 2020 and May 1, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information.
•increased revenues at our Big Springs Refinery Crude Pipeline, as a result of new contracts executed in the second quarter of 2020; and
•increases in the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold, partially offset by decreases in the average sales volume of gasoline and diesel sold in our West Texas marketing operations:
◦the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold increased by $0.78 per gallon and $0.83 per gallon, respectively; and
◦the average volumes of gasoline sold decreased by 10.5 million gallons, offset by 8.8 million decrease of diesel gallons sold.
Such increases were partially offset by the following:
•decreases in throughputs due to the impact of the severe freezing conditions that affected most of the regions where we operate resulting in lower volumes outside of contractual MVCs during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020; and
•decreases in throughputs at the Paline pipeline due to scheduled pipeline maintenance.
Net revenues included sales to our refining segment of $417.0 million and $377.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and sales to our other segment of $1.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We eliminate this intercompany revenue in consolidation.
Cost of Materials and Other
Cost of materials and other for the logistics segment increased by $115.3 million, or 42.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the following related to our West Texas marketing operations:
•the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold increased by $0.83 per gallon and $0.80 per gallon, respectively; and
•the average volumes of gasoline and diesel sold decreased by 10.5 million gallons and 8.8 million gallons, respectively.
Our logistics segment purchased product from our refining segment of $321.9 million and $203.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We eliminate these intercompany costs in consolidation.

Retail Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Revenues
Net revenues for the retail segment increased by $115.7 million, or 17.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the following:
•an increase in total fuel sales which were $480.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $357.9 million for 2020, primarily attributable to a $0.86 increase in average price charged per gallon sold, slightly offset by a decrease in total retail fuel gallons sold; and
•slightly offset by a decrease in merchandise sales to $316.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $323.8 million for 2020, primarily driven by the same-store sales decrease of (1.8)%.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Capital
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are
•cash generated from our operating activities;
•borrowings under our debt facilities; and
•potential issuances of additional equity and debt securities.
At December 31, 2021 our total liquidity amounted to $2.2 billion comprised primarily of $729.6 million in unused credit commitments under the Delek Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), $592.0 million in unused credit commitments under the DKL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $856.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Historically, we have generated adequate cash from operations to fund ongoing working capital requirements, pay quarterly cash dividends and fund operational capital expenditures. In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and the decline in oil prices, on November 5, 2020, we announced that we elected to suspend dividends in order to conserve capital. Other funding sources including borrowings under existing credit agreements and issuance of equity and debt securities have been utilized to meet our funding requirements and support our growth capital projects and acquisitions. In addition we have historically been able to source funding at terms that reflect market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings. We continue to monitor market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings and expect future funding sources to be at terms that are sustainable and profitable for the Company. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future debt or equity financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us; any execution of such financing activities will be dependent on the contemporaneous availability of functioning debt or equity markets. Additionally, new debt financing activities will be subject to the satisfaction of any debt incurrence limitation covenants in our existing financing agreements. Our debt limitation covenants in our existing financing documents are usual and customary for credit agreements of our type and reflective of market conditions at the time of their execution. Additionally, our ability to satisfy working capital requirements, to service our debt obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures, or to pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the oil industry and other financial and business factors, including the current COVID-19 Pandemic and oil prices, some of which are beyond our control.
During 2021 and through the date of this Annual Report, the COVID-19 Pandemic has had a significant negative impact on economic conditions in the U.S., and a particularly severe impact on the oil and gas industry because of the significant impact the Pandemic has had on motor and air travel. As previously discussed at length in the 'Executive Summary and Strategic Overview' Section of Management's Discussion and Analysis, we have identified several uncertainties and related risks associated with the current and potential future effects of the Pandemic, including increased uncertainty and risk associated with our ability to manage liquidity and capital resources. As a result, and while it's always a critical area of focus, we have dedicated significant efforts throughout 2021 to monitoring and evaluating the evolving uncertainties around liquidity and capital resources and implementing measures and plans to mitigate and manage the associated risk. Here are some of our most significant areas of focus:
•We have focused on required maintenance and regulatory projects as well as strategically-timed turnaround activities. As a result, we were able to reduce our capital expenditures to $227.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to our initial full-year forecast included in our December 31, 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K of $239.6 million;
•The temporary suspension of growth and non-essential projects (particularly in Refining) provided us with the opportunity to shift our focus to process improvement initiatives, cost control measures, and opportunities for innovation, which has improved our ability to control costs in terms of operating expenses and critical capital projects, all of which also favorably impact our cash position and provide a longer term foundation for increased operational effectiveness;
•Throughout 2021, we continued to monitor credit and liquidity of our key customers, which already go through a stringent and ongoing credit evaluation as part of our internal controls, and we have been able to successfully maintain our collection efforts without significant losses or write-offs. As part of this effort, we also continue to monitor our customers, as well as vendors, for any areas of concentration that could put us at undue risk, and have experienced no significant deterioration in credit or concentration risks that warrant disclosure;
•We continued executing on our strategy of divesting of non-strategic or underperforming assets. We made significant divestitures of underperforming stores in Retail during 2019 and in 2020 we focused on executing a transaction to divest our remaining non-operating refinery located in Bakersfield, California. See further discussion in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K;
•To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilized (and continue to utilize) various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our commodity exposure against pricing risk. In many cases, we hedge our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance, allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility. We supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions. These activities included certain fixed price purchase contracts and crack spread hedges executed throughout the year to ensure that we were not overly exposed to the unusually high market volatility which could impact cash requirements at settlement. However, many of these activities also require margin deposits that can fluctuate significantly in a volatile market, much of which cannot be anticipated;

Management's Discussion and Analysis
•We continue to actively monitor our maintenance and incurrence covenants under our credit facilities and debt instruments, and have implemented enhancements in our cash forecasting and modeling that allow us to better anticipate potential issues, in many cases, before they occur. We believe that our enhanced forecasting efforts and processes will better position us to preemptively work toward amendments with lenders as needed, though it is possible that amendments may not be granted for reasons that may or may not be known to us;
•We have examined our discretionary uses of cash, including our stock repurchase activities and dividend distribution payments, both of which are designed to provide a return on shareholder value in times of favorable economic conditions and operating results, but which can actually weaken shareholder value in times of economic distress and downward pressure on our operating results if such activities diminish our ability to appropriately manage and mitigate the heightened risk. As a result of this examination, beginning in the second quarter 2020, we have temporarily suspended the repurchase of shares. Additionally, on November 5, 2020, we announced that we have elected to suspend dividends indefinitely beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. Both of these decisions have the immediate benefit of conserving capital. Depending on market conditions, we may make the decision to resume share repurchases which may take priority over future dividends or growth capital; and
•Finally, we are always evaluating our existing sources of capital and considering the feasibility and potential advantages of strategic transactions and capital markets opportunities that could expand our sources of liquidity and strengthen our flexibility, while balancing the comparative cost of capital, the incremental leverage risk, as well as the potential transactional risk on our core business and infrastructure. We are pleased that, despite the challenging environment, we have continued to successfully manage our liquidity and available sources of capital during 2021 through strategic transactions such as the following:
◦By monetizing assets (including financial assets such as RINs inventories), where the cost of capital is not cost-prohibitive compared to the liquidity considerations, through product financing arrangements; and
◦By taking advantage of credit opportunities and favorable investment markets, where appropriate. The most significant of these transactions executed during 2021 were as follows:
▪On May 24, 2021, Delek Logistics and Finance Corp. issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount 7.125% Senior Notes due 2028 (the "Delek Logistics 2028 Notes”) at par, requiring semi-annual interest payments in arrears on each June 1 and December 1, commencing on December 31, 2021. See further discussion in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
▪In December 2021, we initiated a program to monetize a portion of our ownership in Delek Logistics under a Rule 10b5-1 program to sell up to 434,590 common limited partner units, which helped us to not only capture $2.1 million (pre-tax) tangible value to date in the Delek valuation but also serves to improve the liquidity of the Delek Logistics units without diluting the overall market capitalization of Delek Logistics. See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As a result of these efforts, and despite the devastating economic effects of the Pandemic on our industry, we have maintained a strong cash position with capital resources flexibility that positions us well as we look forward to the expected economic recovery from the Pandemic, where crack spread forecasts and forward curves indicate the market's expectation for significant recovery in 2022 and stabilization by 2023. We believe we have sufficient financial resources from the above sources to meet our funding requirements in the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, quarterly cash distributions for Delek Logistics public unitholders, and planned capital expenditures. However, if market conditions were to change, for instance due to the significant decline in oil prices or uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be unfavorably impacted.
As of December 31, 2021, we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt maintenance covenants, where the most significant long-term obligation subject to such covenants was the Delek Logistics Credit Facility (see further discussion in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). After considering the current effect of the significant decline in oil prices and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, we currently expect to remain in compliance with our existing debt maintenance covenants, though we can provide no assurances, particularly if conditions significantly worsen beyond our ability to predict. Additionally, we were in compliance with incurrence covenants during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 to the extent that any of our activities triggered these covenants. However, given the uncertainty around economic conditions arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that conditions could change significantly, and that such changes could adversely impact our ability to meet some of these incurrence based covenants, in the event that our activities would warrant testing these covenants. Failure to meet the incurrence covenants could impose certain incremental restrictions on our ability to incur new debt and also may limit whether and the extent to which we may resume paying dividends, as well as impose additional restrictions on our ability to repurchase our stock, make new investments and incur new liens (among others). Such restrictions would generally remain in place until such quarter that we return to compliance under the applicable incurrence based covenants. In the event that we are subject to these incremental restrictions, we believe that we have sufficient current and alternative sources of liquidity, including (but not limited to): available borrowings under our existing Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, and for Delek Logistics, under its Delek Logistics Credit Facility (see further discussion in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K); the allowance to incur an additional $200 million of secured debt under the Wells Fargo Term Loan Credit Facility (see further discussion in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K); as well as the possibility of obtaining other secured and unsecured debt, raising capital through equity issuance, or taking advantage of transactional financing opportunities such as sale-leasebacks or joint ventures, as otherwise contemplated and allowed under our incurrence covenants.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows (in millions):
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $371.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash used of $282.9 million for the comparable period of 2020. Cash receipts from customers and cash payments to suppliers and for salaries increased resulting in a net $660.5 million increase in cash from operating activities. Partially offsetting these increases in cash provided were an increase in cash paid for debt interest of $1.6 million, an increase in income taxes paid of $0.6 million and a decrease in dividends received of $4.0 million.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $178.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $191.3 million in the comparable period of 2020. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to distributions received in the prior year from our WWP Project Financing JV to return excess capital contributions made in the amount of $69.3 million and proceeds of $39.9 million from the sale of the Bakersfield refinery in the prior year for which there was no comparable activity in the current year period.
These increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment which decreased from $269.4 million in 2020, to $222.2 million in 2021, partially attributable to delaying non-essential projects in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Additionally, equity method investment contributions decreased $29.5 million primarily due to contributions made related to our Red River Pipeline Joint Venture and WWP Project Financing JV (each as defined in Note 6 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for $12.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we contributed $1.4 million related to our Red River Pipeline Joint Venture and $0.3 million related to our WWP Project Financing JV.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash provided of $306.4 million in the comparable 2020 period. This decrease in cash provided was predominantly due to net payments on long-term revolvers and term debt of $132.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net proceeds of $275.3 million in the comparable 2020 period. Additionally, net proceeds from product financing arrangements decreased to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $169.1 million in the comparable 2020 period.
Such decreases were partially offset by increases of $69.1 million due to suspension of dividends in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $28.9 million due to the repurchase of non-controlling interest in the prior year period with no comparable activity in the current year.
Cash Position and Indebtedness
As of December 31, 2021, our total cash and cash equivalents were $856.5 million and we had total long-term indebtedness of approximately $2,218.0 million. The total long-term indebtedness is net of deferred financing costs and debt discount of $10.5 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Additionally, we had letters of credit issued of approximately $270.4 million. Total unused credit commitments or borrowing base availability, as applicable, under our revolving credit facilities was approximately $1,321.6 million. The decrease of $130.4 million in total long term indebtedness as of December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year resulted primarily from net repayments under the Delek Logistics Credit Facility and other term debt in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our total long-term indebtedness consisted of the following:
•an aggregate principal amount of $1,260.0 million under the Term Loan Credit Facility, due on March 30, 2025, with effective interest of 3.53%;
•an aggregate principal amount of $29.2 million in outstanding borrowings under the Delek Hapoalim Term Loan, due on December 31, 2022, with effective interest of 3.67%;
•an aggregate principal amount of $258.0 million under the Delek Logistics Credit Facility, due on September 28, 2023, with average borrowing rate of 2.46%;
•an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million under the Delek Logistics 2025 Notes, due in 2025, with effective interest rate of 7.20%;
•an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million under the Delek Logistics 2028 Notes, due in 2028, with effective interest rate of 7.41%;
97 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
•an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million under the Reliant Bank Revolver, due on June 30, 2022, with fixed interest rate of 4.50%; and
•the Revolving Credit Facility, due on March 30, 2023, with borrowing rate of 3.50% for base rate loans, and no principal amount outstanding.
See Note 10 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our separate debt and credit facilities.
Additionally, we also utilize other financing arrangements to finance operating assets and/or, from time to time, to monetize other assets that may not be needed in the near term, when internal cost of capital and other criteria are met. Such arrangements include our supply and offtake arrangements, which finance a significant portion of our first-in, first-out inventory at the refineries and, from time to time, RINs or other non-inventory product financing liabilities. Our supply and offtake obligation with J. Aron amounted to $487.5 million at December 31, 2021, $330.4 million of which is due on December 30, 2022, except that a portion (not to exceed $28.6 million, net of the $(10.0) million settlement threshold) of this otherwise long-term component is subject to potential earlier payment under the Periodic Price Adjustment provision. See Note 9 of the our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our supply and offtake facilities. Our product financing liabilities consisted primarily of RIN financings as of December 31, 2021, and totaled $249.6 million, all of which is due in the next 12 months. See further description of these types of arrangements in the Environmental Credits and Related Regulatory Obligations accounting policy disclosed in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For both arrangements and the related commitments, see also our "Contractual Obligations and Commitments" section included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Debt Ratings
We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels and seniorities, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities.
There are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. However, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility implementations and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future. Additionally, any rating downgrades may increase the likelihood of us having to post additional letters of credit or cash collateral under certain contractual arrangements.
Capital Spending
A key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for 2021, by segment, as well as planned capital expenditures for 2022 by operating segment and major category (in millions):
98 |
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The amount of our capital expenditure budget is subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects and subject to the changes and uncertainties discussed under the 'Forward-Looking Statements' section of Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information, please refer to our discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cash Requirements
Long-Term Cash Requirements Under Contractual Obligations
Information regarding our known cash requirements under contractual obligations of the types described below as of December 31, 2021, is set forth in the following table (in millions):
(1) Expected interest payments on debt outstanding at December 31, 2021. Floating interest rate debt is calculated using December 31, 2021 rates. For additional information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(2) Amounts reflect future estimated lease payments under operating leases having remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2021.
(3) We have purchase commitments to secure certain quantities of crude oil, finished product and other resources used in production at both fixed and market prices. We have estimated future payments under the market-based agreements using current market rates. Excludes purchase commitments in buy-sell transactions which have matching notional amounts with the same counterparty and are generally net settled in exchanges.
(4) Balances consist of obligations under RINs product financing arrangements, as described in the 'Environmental Credits and Related Regulatory Obligations' accounting policy included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(5) Balances consist of contractual obligations under agreements with third parties (not including Delek Logistics) for the transportation of crude oil to our refineries.
(6) Balances consists of contractual obligations under the J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreements, including annual fees and principal obligation for the Baseline Volume Step-Out Liability. For additional information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Cash Requirements
Our material short-term cash requirements under contractual obligations are presented above, and we expect to fund the majority of those requirements with cash flows from operations, with the exception of the supply and offtake obligations, which are expected to be refinanced. Our other cash requirements consisted of operating activities and capital expenditures. Operating activities include cash outflows related to payments to suppliers for crude and other inventories (which are largely reflected in our contractual purchase commitments in the table above) and payments for salaries and other employee related costs. Cash outlays in the first quarter of 2022 are planned to include incentive compensation payments that were earned and accrued in 2021. In line with our Long-term Sustainable strategy, future cash requirements will include initiatives to build on our long term sustainable business model, ESG initiatives and digital transformation.
Refer to the cash flow section for our operating activities spend in 2021. While many of the expenses related to the operating activities are variable in nature, some of the expenditures can be somewhat fixed in the short-term due to forward planning on our level of activity.
Refer to the 'Capital Spending' section for our capital expenditures for 2021 and our anticipated cash requirements for planned capital expenditures for 2022.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Critical Accounting Estimates
The fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.
Goodwill
Goodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, if a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value (Step 1), the impairment assessment leads to the testing of the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount (Step 2). If the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-04 (which we adopted during the fourth quarter of 2018, as permitted by the ASU), Step 2 is no longer required, but rather any impairment is determined based on the results of Step 1.
In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), forecasted crack spreads, gross margin, capital expenditures, and long-term growth rate based on historical information and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also consider a market approach in determining or corroborating the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. The market approach involves significant judgment, including selection of an appropriate peer group, selection of valuation multiples, and determination of the appropriate weighting in our valuation model. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, sustained decrease in the crack spreads, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. The most significant risks to our valuation and the potential future impairment of goodwill are the WACC and the volatility of the crack spread, which is based on the crude oil and the refined product markets. The crack spread is often unpredictable and may negatively impact our results of operations in ways that cannot be anticipated and that are beyond management's control. Additionally, rising interest rates (which often occur in under inflationary conditions) may also adversely impact our WACC. A higher WACC, all other things being equal, will result in a lower valuation using a discounted cash flow model, which is an income approach. Therefore, rising interest rates can cause a reporting unit to become impaired when, in a lower interest rate environment, it may not be.
We may also elect to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill balances. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes that, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is required to perform the quantitative impairment test. Alternatively, if a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it has completed its goodwill impairment test and does not need to perform the quantitative impairment test.
We performed a qualitative assessment on the reporting units in our logistics segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, which did not result in an impairment charge nor did our analysis reflect any reporting units at risk.
Our quantitative assessment of goodwill performed on the reporting units in our refining and retail segments during the fourth quarter of 2021, resulted in no impairment during the year ended December 31, 2021. There was $126.0 million impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020 and no impairment in 2019. As part of our assessment, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units have been reconciled to our market capitalization for reasonableness. Each of the reporting units have a fair value that is substantially in excess of its carrying value, with the exception of the Krotz Springs refinery ("KSR") reporting unit.
Given the relatively small cushion for the KSR reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our impairment test noting the following:
(in millions) Sensitivity
Goodwill Balance at 2021 Annual Assessment Date % Estimated Fair Value exceeds Carrying Value Increase in WACC that could cause impairment (1)
KSR $ 212.2 <10% 1.5%-2.0%
(1) Assumes no other changes in any of the key assumptions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Evaluation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs")
Our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of our subsidiaries and VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a VIE. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE’s assets. If we are not the primary beneficiary, the general partner or another limited partner may consolidate the VIE, and we record the investment as an equity method investment. Significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary in a VIE. Generally, the primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support; the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.
Environmental Liabilities
It is our policy to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities represent the current estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at sites where we have environmental exposure. This estimate is based on assessments of the extent of the contamination, the selected remediation methodology and review of applicable environmental regulations, typically considering estimated activities and costs for 15 years, and up to 30 years if a longer period is believed reasonably necessary. Such estimates may require judgment with respect to costs, time frame and extent of required remedial and clean-up activities. Accruals for estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and include, but are not limited to, costs to perform remedial actions and costs of machinery and equipment that are dedicated to the remedial actions and that do not have an alternative use. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. We discount environmental liabilities to their present value if payments are fixed or reliably determinable. Expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized.
Changes in laws and regulations and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Delek recognizes liabilities which represent the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities, including those that are conditional on a future event, when the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability’s fair value.
In the refining segment, we have asset retirement obligations with respect to our refineries due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of these assets at the time they are retired. However, the majority of these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time provided that they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and intent to continue to maintain these assets and make improvements based on technological advances. In the logistics segment, these obligations relate to the required cleanout of the pipeline and terminal tanks and removal of certain above-grade portions of the pipeline situated on right-of-way property. In the retail segment, we have asset retirement obligations related to the removal of underground storage tanks and the removal of brand signage at owned and leased retail sites which are legally required under the applicable leases. The asset retirement obligation for storage tank removal on leased retail sites is accreted over the expected life of the owned retail site or the average retail site lease term.
In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligations. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Non-GAAP Measures
Our management uses certain “non-GAAP” operational measures to evaluate our operating segment performance and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:
•Refining margin - calculated as the difference between net refining revenues and total cost of materials and other;
•Refined product margin - calculated as the difference between net revenues attributable to refined products (produced and purchased) and related cost of materials and other (which is applicable to both the refining segment and the West Texas wholesale marketing activities within our logistics segment); and
•Refining margin per barrels sold - calculated as refining margin divided by our average refining sales in bpd (excluding purchased barrels) multiplied by 1,000 and multiplied by the number of days in the period.
We believe these non-GAAP operational and financial measures are useful to investors, lenders, ratings agencies and analysts to assess our ongoing performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measure, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and they may obscure our underlying results and trends.
Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
