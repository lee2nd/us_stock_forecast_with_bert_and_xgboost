Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
We are an independent energy company focused on the development, exploration, exploitation, acquisition, and production of natural gas and crude oil properties with principal holdings in the U.S. Permian Basin and additional holdings in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and in the South American country of Colombia.
Our mission is to deliver outstanding net asset value per share growth to our investors via attractive oil and gas investments. Our strategy is to focus on early identification of, and opportunistic entrance into, existing and emerging resource plays. We do not operate wells but typically seek to partner with larger operators in development of resources or retain interests, with or without contribution on our part, in prospects identified, packaged and promoted to larger operators. By entering these plays earlier, identifying stranded blocks and partnering with, or promoting to, larger operators, we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs.
We, along with our partners, actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified, developed, monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves, production and shareholder value.
Generally, we generate nearly all our revenues and cash flows from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil, whether through royalty interests, working interests or other arrangements. We may also realize gains and additional cash flows from the periodic divestiture of assets.
Recent Developments
Lease Activity
Colombia. In 2019, we acquired a 2% interest in Hupecol Meta, LLC (“Hupecol Meta”) (the “Hupecol Meta Acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms of the Hupecol Meta Acquisition, we paid total consideration of approximately $197,000. During 2020, we invested an additional $63,405 in Hupecol Meta. In 2021, we contributed an additional $99,716 to Hupecol Meta, increasing our ownership interest to 7.85%
Hupecol Meta holds a working interest in the 639,405 gross acre CPO-11 block in the Llanos Basin in Colombia, comprised of the 69,128 acre Venus Exploration Area and 570,277 acres, which was 50% farmed out by Hupecol Meta. As a result of Hupecol Meta’s 2021 purchase of additional interest in the CPO-11 block and the increase in our ownership interest in Hupecol Meta, through our membership interest in Hupecol Meta, we hold a 6.99% interest in the Venus Exploration Area and a 3.495% interest in the remainder of the block.
Drilling Activity and Well Operations
During 2021, our Lou Brock #1-H well in Hockley County, Texas was plugged and abandoned following a failed fracturing operation. Otherwise, no drilling activities were conducted during 2021.
During 2021, our Johnson and O’Brien wells in Reeves County were placed on gas lift.
Capital Investments
During 2021, our capital investment expenditures for acreage acquisitions, drilling, completion and related operations, as well as investments in Hupecol Meta, totaled $238,180, principally relating to investments in Hupecol Meta ($195,374) and placing our Reeves County wells on gas lift ($42,8067).
Financing Activities
In January 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Univest Securities, LLC (“Univest”) pursuant to which we could sell, at our option, up to an aggregate of $4,768,428 in shares of common stock through Univest, as sales agent. Sales of shares under the Sales Agreement (the “2021 ATM Offering”) were made, in accordance with placement notices delivered to Univest, which notices set parameters under which shares could be sold. The 2021 ATM Offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement by methods deemed to be “at the market,” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. We agreed to pay Univest a commission in cash equal to 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares in the 2021 ATM Offering. Additionally, we reimbursed Univest for $18,000 of expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 ATM Offering.
During January 2021, we sold an aggregate of 2,108,520 shares in the 2021 ATM Offering and received proceeds, net of commissions, of $4,625,361.
In February 2021, we entered into a second Sales Agreement with Univest pursuant to which we could sell, at our option, up to an aggregate of $2,030,000 in shares of common stock through Univest, as sales agent. Sales of shares under the Sales Agreement (the “2021 Supplemental ATM Offering”) were made, in accordance with placement notices delivered to Univest, which notices set parameters under which shares could be sold. The 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement by methods deemed to be “at the market,” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. We agreed to pay Univest a commission in cash equal to 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares in the 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering. Additionally, we reimbursed Univest for $18,000 of expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering.
During February 2021, we sold an aggregate of 813,100 shares in the 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering and received proceeds, net of commissions, of $1,969,092.
Proceeds from the 2021 ATM Offering and 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering were used to support our acquisitions of our ongoing efforts to acquire additional acreage positions, to support future drilling operations and to fund redemption of outstanding preferred stock.
Conversion and Redemption of Preferred Stock. In February 2021, 60 shares of our 12% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into 24,000 shares of common stock and we redeemed all remaining outstanding shares of our 12% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 12% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for $1.97 million plus accrued dividends totaling $32,700.
Recovery of Escrow Account
In 2010, we, and our operator in Colombia, Hupecol, sold our interests in two entities in Colombia. Pursuant to the terms of those sales, a portion of the sales price was escrowed to secure certain representations of the selling parties. Our share of amounts escrowed was recorded as escrow receivables.
In 2016, we recorded an allowance in the amount of $262,016 relating to the undisbursed balance of escrow receivables.
In 2020, we received payments totaling $164,706, net, representing recoveries of escrowed funds relating to the previously written-off escrow receivables. As a result of the receipt of such funds, we recorded non-recurring other income in the amount of $164,706 in 2020.
COVID-19
In early 2020, global health care systems and economies began to experience strain from the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus. As the virus spread, global economic activity began to slow and future economic activity slowed with a resulting decline in oil and gas demand and prices. Such decline in prices adversely affected our revenues and profitability in 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to recede, oil and gas prices rose during 2021 to levels exceeding pre-pandemic levels. If a resurgence of COVID-19 occurs and results in price declines as occurred during 2020, the economics of our existing wells and planned future wells, will be adversely affected, possibly resulting in impairment charges to existing properties and delaying or abandoning planned drilling operations as uneconomical.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our staff and certain of our vendors, service suppliers and partners began working remotely. As a result of such remote work arrangements, certain operational, reporting, accounting and other processes were slowed resulting in longer time to execute critical business functions, higher operating costs and uncertainties regarding the quality of services and supplies. While remote work risks have receded as the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to wane, we might experience future operating challenges in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting. Such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below. In those cases, our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method.
Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Activities. We follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Under this method, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical work, delay rentals, costs of drilling, completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities, but does not include any cost related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved. No corporate overhead has been capitalized as of December 31, 2021. The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves, are amortized on a units-of-production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation. The capitalized oil and gas property costs, less accumulated amortization, are limited to an amount (the ceiling limitation) equal to the sum of: (a) the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves, calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the preceding twelve months (such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties) and a discount factor of 10%; (b) the cost of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized; (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized; and (d) related income tax effects. Costs in excess of this ceiling are charged to proved properties impairment expense.
Revenue recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not complete at December 31, 2017. ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method, prior period financial positions and results are not adjusted. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized in the opening balances included no significant changes as a result of this adoption. While our 2018 net earnings were not materially impacted by revenue recognition timing changes, Topic 606 requires certain changes to the presentation of revenues and related expenses beginning January 1, 2018.
Our revenue is comprised principally of revenue from exploration and production activities. Our oil is sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. Natural gas is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to direct end-users, refiners, and marketers. Payment is generally received from the customer in the month following delivery.
Contracts with customers have varying terms, including spot sales or month-to-month contracts, contracts with a finite term, and life-of-field contracts where all production from a well or group of wells is sold to one or more customers. We recognize sales revenues for oil, natural gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each product sold to a customer when control transfers to the customer. Generally, control transfers at the time of delivery to the customer at a pipeline interconnect, the tailgate of a processing facility, or as a tanker lifting is completed. Revenue is measured based on the contract price, which may be index-based or fixed, and may include adjustments for market differentials and downstream costs incurred by the customer, including gathering, transportation, and fuel costs.
Revenues are recognized for the sale of our net share of production volumes.
Unevaluated Oil and Gas Properties. Unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases, net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties. When leases are developed, expire or are abandoned, the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to oil and gas properties subject to amortization. Additionally, we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments, and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases.
Unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects includes $2,343,126 and $2,343,126 expended for properties in South America at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively and $1,638,679 expended for properties in the US at December 31, 2020. We are maintaining our interest in these properties.
Stock-Based Compensation. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the options, dividend yield, an appropriate risk-free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized on the Statements of Operations.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Oil and Gas Revenues. Total oil and gas revenues increased 141% to $1,330,198 in 2021 from $552,345 in 2020.
The increase in revenues was attributable to (i) improved commodity pricing, including 79% and 263% increases in crude oil prices and natural gas prices, respectively, realized during 2021 compared to 2020, and (ii) a 26% increase in crude oil production volumes during 2021, partially offset by a 13% decrease in natural gas production during 2021.
The following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells, net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales prices for 2021 and 2020:
The gross/net producing wells reflects cessation of operation, and ultimate sale, of two uneconomical wells in Louisiana, offset by the commencement of operations of two wells in Yoakum County, Texas. The change in production volumes was primarily attributable to the increase in production at our Frost #1 and Frost #2 wells, partially offset by the shut-in of our O’Brien #3-H well for repair and natural decline in production from our other Reeves County well. With our Reeves County wells being put on gas lift during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we anticipate an increase in production from those wells in future periods.
The change in average sales prices realized reflects a spike in natural gas prices attributable to increased demand accompanying the February freezing weather in Texas and a broad recovery in global energy prices reflecting increased energy demand and reduced global supplies as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
All oil and gas sales revenues are attributable to U.S. operations.
Lease Operating Expenses. Lease operating expenses increased 50% to $606,210 in 2021 from $403,974 in 2020.
The change in lease operating expenses was principally attributable to increased severance taxes associated with the increase in oil and gas revenues and non-recurring water disposal and operating costs incurred on the Lou Brock well during testing.
All lease operating expenses during 2021 and 2020 were attributable to U.S. operations.
Depreciation and Depletion Expense. Depreciation and depletion expense decreased by 33% to $245,606 in 2021 from $364,810 in 2020. The decrease in depreciation and depletion during 2021 a lower depletable base during 2021 following impairment charges incurred during 2020, partially offset by increased production volume.
Impairment Expense. Impairment expense totaled $0 during 2021 and $2,519,032 in 2020. The impairment expense during 2020 was due to a decrease in the market price of oil and gas as well as downward adjustments to the projected future production from our wells.
General and Administrative Expenses (Excluding Stock-Based Compensation). General and administrative expense increased by 15% to $1,168,969 in 2021 from $1,012,717 in 2020. The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increased professional fees.
Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation decreased to $323,611 in 2021 from $434,581 in 2020. The change was attributable to the issuance of fully vested stock options during 2020.
Other Income (Expense). Other income/expense, net, totaled $12,668 of income during 2021, compared to $145,695 of income during 2020. Other income consisted of interest earned on cash balances and, during 2020, $164,706 of other income arising from the recovery of escrowed funds previously written off, which, during 2020, was offset by interest expense relating to notes payable that were repaid in January 2020.
Financial Condition
Liquidity and Capital Resources. At December 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $4,894,577 and working capital of $5,052,685, compared to a cash balance of $1,242,560 and working capital of $1,142,512 at December 31, 2020.
Cash Flows. Operating activities used cash of $680,691 during 2021, compared to $864,787 used during 2020. The change in cash flows from operating activities was attributable to a lower loss incurred during the 2021 period.
Investing activities used cash of $238,180 during 2021, compared to $1,571,785 used during 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities reflects decreased drilling, development and acquisition activities during 2021 compared to 2020. During 2021, our investing activities consisted principally of additional investments in Hupecol Meta ($195,374) and investments with respect to our Permian Basin properties ($42,806), principally relating to putting two wells on gas lift. During 2020, out investing activities included the cost of acquisition, evaluation, and development of U.S. properties ($1,503,349), attributable to acreage acquired in the Northern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Texas, (2) drilling and development operations in the U.S. Permian Basin ($6,527), and (3) investments in Hupecol Meta relating to drilling operations in Colombia ($63,396), partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties ($1,487).
Financing activities provided cash of $4,570,888 during 2021, compared to $3,581,217 provided during 2020. During 2021, cash provided by financing activities was attributable to funds received from the sale of common stock ($6,575,889) under our 2021 ATM Offering and 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering, partially offset by the payment of dividends on preferred stock ($37,201) and redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock ($1,967,800). During 2020, cash provided by financing activities was attributable to funds received from the sale of common stock under our 2019 ATM Offering, totaling $4,434,169, partially offset by repayment of Bridge Loan Notes in the amount of $621,052 and payment of dividends on our preferred stock of $231,900.
Long-Term Liabilities. At December 31, 2021, we had long-term liabilities of $279,953, compared to $171,791 at December 31, 2020. Long-term liabilities, as of December 31, 2021, consisted of a reserve for plugging costs of $68,209 and a lease liability of $211,744.
Capital and Exploration Expenditures and Commitments. Our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to ongoing efforts to acquire, drill and complete prospects, in particular our Permian Basin acreage and our Colombian acreage held through Hupecol Meta. Based on discussions with Hupecol Meta, we anticipate that drilling operations on our CPO-11 block in Colombia will commence in mid-2022. There are no present plans to conduct additional drilling operations on our U.S. properties. The actual timing and number of well operations undertaken will be principally controlled by the operators of our acreage based on a number of factors, including but not limited to availability of financing, performance of existing wells on the subject acreage, energy prices and industry condition and outlook, costs of drilling and completion services and equipment and other factors beyond our control or that of our operators.
In addition to possible operations on our existing acreage holdings, we continue to evaluate drilling prospects in which we may acquire an interest and participate.
As our allocable share of well costs will vary depending on the timing and number of wells drilled as well as our working interest in each such well and the level of participation of other interest owners, we have not established a drilling budget but will budget on a well-by-well basis as our operators propose wells.
With our receipt, during 2021, of $6.5 million from sales of common stock under our 2021 ATM Offering and 2021 Supplemental ATM Offering, we believe that we have the ability, through our cash on-hand, to fund operations and our cost for all planned wells expected to be drilled during 2022.
In the event that we pursue additional acreage acquisitions or expand our drilling plans, we may be required to secure additional funding beyond our resources on hand. While we may, among other efforts, seek additional funding from “at-the-market” sales of common stock, and private sales of equity and debt securities, we presently have only 987,096 authorized shares of common stock available for issuance to support equity capital raises and we have no commitments to provide additional funding, and there can be no assurance that we can secure the necessary capital to fund our share of drilling, acquisition or other costs on acceptable terms or at all. If, for any reason, we are unable to fund our share of drilling and completion costs and fail to satisfy commitments relative to our interest in our acreage, we may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some of our rights and interests in prospects with respect to which we fail to satisfy funding commitments and we may be required to curtail operations and forego opportunities.
