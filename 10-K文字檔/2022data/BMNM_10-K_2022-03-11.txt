ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The discussion may contain certain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements
are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of
many factors, such as those set forth under “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K,
our actual results may differ materially from those
anticipated in such forward-looking statements.
Overview
Bimini Capital Management, Inc. ("Bimini Capital" or the "Company") is a holding
company that was formed in September 2003.
The Company’s principal wholly-owned operating subsidiary is Royal Palm Capital,
LLC. We operate in two business segments: the
asset management segment, which includes (a) the investment advisory services provided
by Royal Palm’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC, to Orchid, and (b) the investment portfolio segment, which
includes the investment activities conducted
by Royal Palm.
Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (an investment advisor registered
with the
Securities and Exchange Commission), are collectively referred to as
“Bimini Advisors.”
Bimini Advisors serves as the external
manager of the portfolio of Orchid Island Capital, Inc. ("Orchid"). From this arrangement,
the Company receives management fees and
expense reimbursements.
As manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid's business activities and
day-to-day
operations.
Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors
provides Orchid with its management team,
including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times
subject to the supervision and oversight of
Orchid's board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to
it.
Royal Palm Capital, LLC (collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries
referred to as “Royal Palm”) maintains an investment
portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities ("MBS")
issued and guaranteed by a federally chartered
corporation or agency ("Agency MBS"). We also invest in the common stock of Orchid. Our
investment strategy focuses on, and our
portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency
MBS, such as mortgage pass-through
certificates issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae (the “GSEs”)
and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) issued
by the GSEs (“PT MBS”) and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as interest
only securities ("IOs"), inverse interest only securities
("IIOs") and principal only securities ("POs"), among other types of
structured Agency MBS. In addition, Royal Palm receives dividends
from its investment in Orchid common shares.
Stock Repurchase
Plans
On March 26,
2018, the
Board of
Directors
of the Company
approved
a Stock Repurchase
Plan the
“2018 Repurchase
Plan”).
Pursuant
to the 2018
Repurchase
Plan, we
could purchase
up to 500,000
shares of
the Company’s
Class A Common
Stock from
time to
time, subject
to certain
limitations
imposed by
Rule 10b-18
of the Securities
Exchange
Act of 1934.
The 2018
Repurchase
Plan was
terminated
on September
16, 2021.
During the
period beginning
January 1,
2021 through
September
16, 2021,
the Company
repurchased
a total of
1,195 shares
under
the 2018
Repurchase
Plan at an
aggregate
cost of approximately
$2,298, including
commissions
and fees,
for a weighted
average price
of
$1.92 per
share. From
commencement
of the 2018
Repurchase
Plan, through
its termination,
the Company
repurchased
a total of
71,598
shares at
an aggregate
cost of approximately
$169,243,
including
commissions
and fees,
for a weighted
average price
of $2.36
per share.
On September
16, 2021,
the Board
authorized
a share repurchase
plan pursuant
to Rule 10b5-1
of the Securities
Exchange
Act of
1934 (the
“2021 Repurchase
Plan”). Pursuant
to the 2021
Repurchase
Plan, we
may purchase
shares of
our Class
A Common
Stock from
time to time
for an aggregate
purchase price
not to exceed
$2.5 million.
Share repurchases
may be executed
through various
means,
- 38 -
including,
without limitation,
open market
transactions.
The 2021
Repurchase
Plan does
not obligate
the Company
to purchase
any
shares, and
it expires
on September
16, 2023.
The authorization
for the 2021
Repurchase
Plan may be
terminated,
increased
or
decreased
by the Company’s
Board of
Directors
in its discretion
at any time.
From the
commencement
of the 2021
Repurchase
Plan,
through December
31, 2021,
we repurchased
a total of
92,287 shares
at an aggregate
cost of approximately
$192,905,
including
commissions
and fees,
for a weighted
average price
of $2.09
per share.
Subsequent
to December
31, 2021,
and through
March 10,
2022,
the Company
repurchased
a total of
170,422 shares
at an aggregate
cost of approximately
$343,732,
including
commissions
and fees,
for
a weighted
average price
of $2.02
per share.
Tender Offer
In July 2021,
we completed
a “modified
Dutch auction”
tender offer
and paid
$1.5 million,
excluding
fees and
related expenses,
to
repurchase
812,879 shares
of our Class
A common
stock, which
were retired,
at a price
of $1.85 per
share.
Factors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition
A variety of industry and economic factors (in addition to those related to the COVID-19
pandemic) may impact our results of
operations and financial condition. These factors include:
●
interest rate trends;
●
increases in our cost of funds resulting from increases in the Federal Funds rate
that are controlled by the Fed and are likely
to occur in 2022;
●
the difference between Agency MBS yields and our funding and hedging costs;
●
competition for, and supply of, investments in Agency MBS;
●
actions taken by the U.S. government, including the presidential administration,
the U.S. Federal Reserve (the “Fed”), the
Federal Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”), The Federal Housing Finance
Agency (the “FHFA”) and the U.S. Treasury;
●
prepayment rates on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS, and credit trends
insofar as they affect prepayment rates;
●
the equity markets and the ability of Orchid to raise additional capital;
●
geo-political events that affect the U.S. and international economies, such as the current crisis
in Ukraine; and
●
other market developments.
In addition, a variety of factors relating to our business may also impact our results
of operations and financial condition. These
factors include:
●
our degree of leverage;
●
our access to funding and borrowing capacity;
●
our borrowing costs;
●
our hedging activities;
●
the market value of our investments;
●
the requirements to qualify for a registration exemption under the Investment Company Act;
●
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards
to reduce our taxable income;
●
the impact of possible future changes in tax laws or tax rates; and
●
our ability to manage the portfolio of Orchid and maintain our role as manager.

GAAP and
Non-GAAP
Reconciliation
Economic Interest
Expense and
Economic Net
Interest
Income
We use derivative
instruments,
specifically
Eurodollar
and Treasury
Note (“T-Note”)
futures contracts
and TBA
short positions
to
hedge a portion
of the interest
rate risk
on repurchase
agreements
in a rising
rate environment.
We have not
designated
our derivative
financial
instruments
as hedge
accounting
relationships,
but rather
hold them
for economic
hedging purposes.
Changes in
fair value
of these
instruments
are presented
in a separate
line item
in our consolidated
statements
of
operations
and not included
in interest
expense. As
such, for
financial
reporting
purposes,
interest
expense and
cost of funds
are not
impacted by
the fluctuation
in value
of the derivative
instruments.
For the purpose
of computing
economic net
interest
income and
ratios relating
to cost of
funds measures,
GAAP interest
expense has
been adjusted
to reflect
the realized
and unrealized
gains or
losses on
certain derivative
instruments
the Company
uses that
pertain to
each period
presented.
We believe
that adjusting
our interest
expense for
the periods
presented
by the gains
or losses
on these
derivative
instruments
would not
accurately
reflect our
economic interest
expense for
these periods.
The reason
is that these
derivative
instruments
may cover
periods that
extend into
the future,
not just the
current period.
Any realized
or unrealized
gains or
losses on
the instruments
reflect the
change in
market value
of the instrument
caused by
changes in
underlying
interest
rates applicable
to the term
covered by
the
instrument,
not just the
current period.
For each
period presented,
we have combined
the effects
of the derivative
financial
instruments
in place for
the respective
period with
the actual
interest
expense incurred
on our borrowings
to reflect
total economic
interest
expense for
the applicable
period. Interest
expense, including
the effect
of derivative
instruments
for the period,
is referred
to as economic
interest
expense. Net
interest income,
when calculated
to include
the effect
of derivative
instruments
for the period,
is referred
to as economic
net interest
income.
We believe
that economic
interest
expense and
economic
net interest
income provide
meaningful
information
to consider, in
addition
to the respective
amounts prepared
in accordance
with GAAP. The non-GAAP
measures help
management
to evaluate
our financial
position and
performance
without the
effects of
certain transactions
and GAAP
adjustments
that are
not necessarily
indicative
of our
- 40 -
current investment
portfolio
or operations.
The gains
or losses
on derivative
instruments
presented
in our consolidated
statements
of
operations
are not necessarily
representative
of the total
interest
rate expense
that we will
ultimately
realize. This
is because
as interest
rates move
up or down
in the future,
the gains
or losses
we ultimately
realize, and
which will
affect our
total interest
rate expense
in future
periods,
may differ
from the
unrealized
gains or
losses recognized
as of the
reporting
date.
Our presentation
of the economic
value of our
hedging strategy
has important
limitations.
First, other
market participants
may
calculate
economic
interest
expense and
economic net
interest
income differently
than the
way we calculate
them. Second,
while we
believe that
the calculation
of the economic
value of our
hedging
strategy
described
above helps
to present
our financial
position
and
performance,
it may be
of limited
usefulness
as an analytical
tool. Therefore,
the economic
value of
our investment
strategy should
not be
viewed in
isolation
and is not
a substitute
for interest
expense and
net interest
income computed
in accordance
with GAAP.
The tables
below present
a reconciliation
of the adjustments
to interest
expense shown
for each
period relative
to our derivative
instruments,
and the consolidated
statements
of operations
line item,
gains (losses)
on derivative
instruments,
calculated
in accordance
with GAAP
for the years
ended December
31, 2021
and 2020
and for each
quarter during
2021 and
2020. As
a result
of the market
turmoil
during the
first quarter
of 2020 several
hedge positions
where closed.
However, the
hedges closed
were hedges
that covered
periods well
beyond the
first quarter
of 2020.
Accordingly, the
open equity
at the time
these hedges
were closed
will result
in adjustments
to economic
interest
expense through
the balance
of their respective
original
hedge periods.
Since the
Company’s portfolio
was significantly
reduced
during the
first quarter
of 2020, the
effect of applying
the open
equity at
the time
of closure
of these
hedge instruments
to the current,
and
much smaller,
repurchase
agreement
interest
expense amounts
has materially
impacted
the economic
interest
amounts reported
below.

charged
to Orchid
for the management
of its
portfolio
pursuant
to the terms
of a management
agreement.
We receive a monthly management fee in the amount of:
●
One-twelfth of 1.5% of the first $250 million of Orchid’s month-end equity, as defined in the management agreement,
●
One-twelfth of 1.25% of Orchid’s month-end equity that is greater than $250 million
and less than or equal to $500 million, and
●
One-twelfth of 1.00% of Orchid’s month-end equity that is greater than $500 million.
In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for any direct expenses
incurred on its behalf and to pay to us an amount equal to
Orchid's pro rata portion of certain overhead costs set forth in the management
agreement. The management agreement has been
- 43 -
renewed through February 2023 and provides for automatic one-year extension
options. Should Orchid terminate the management
agreement without cause, it will be obligated to pay to us a termination fee equal
to three times the average annual management fee,
as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the automatic
renewal term.

Investment Portfolio Segment
Net Portfolio Interest Income
We define
net portfolio
interest
income as
interest
income on
MBS less
interest
expense on
repurchase
agreement
funding.
During
the year
ended December
31, 2021,
we generated
$2.1 million
of net portfolio
interest
income, consisting
of $2.2 million
of interest
income
from MBS
assets offset
by $0.1 million
of interest
expense on
repurchase
liabilities.
For the year
ended December
31, 2020,
we
generated
$2.7 million
of net portfolio
interest
income, consisting
of $3.8 million
of interest
income from
MBS assets
offset by
$1.1 million
of interest
expense on
repurchase
liabilities.
The $1.5
million
decrease
in interest
income for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
was due
to a $13.2
million decrease
in average
MBS balances,
combined
with a 136
basis point
("bp") decrease
in yields
earned on
the portfolio.
The $1.0
million decrease
in interest
expense for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
was due to
a 121 bp
decrease
in cost of
funds,
combined with
a $10.6 million
decrease
in average
repurchase
liabilities.
Our economic
interest
expense
on repurchase
liabilities
for the
years ended
December
31, 2021
and 2020
was $2.9
million and
$3.7
million, respectively,
resulting
in ($0.7)
million and
$0.1 million
of economic
net portfolio
interest
income, respectively.

Interest Expense on Repurchase Agreements and the Cost of Funds
Our average
outstanding
repurchase
agreements
were $67.4
million and
$78.0 million,
generating
interest
expense of
$0.1 million
and
$1.1 million
for the years
ended December
31, 2021
and 2020,
respectively.
Our average
cost of funds
was 0.17%
and 1.38%
for the
years ended
December
31, 2021 and
2020, respectively.
There was
a 121 bp
decrease
in the average
cost of funds
and a $10.6
million
decrease
in average
outstanding
repurchase
agreements
during the
year ended
December
31, 2021 as
compared
to the year
ended
December
31, 2020.
Our economic
interest
expense
was $2.9
million
and $3.7
million
for the
years ended
December
31, 2021
and 2020,
respectively.
There
was a 33 bp
decrease
in the average
economic cost
of funds to
4.37% for the
year ended
December
31, 2021 from
4.70% for
the previous
year. The $0.8 million
decrease
in economic
interest
expense was
due to the
decrease
in interest
expense on
the repurchase
agreements,
partially
offset by the
negative
performance
of our hedging
agreements
attributed
to the current
period.
Since all
of our repurchase
agreements
are short-term,
changes in
market rates
directly affect
our interest
expense.
Our average
cost
of funds
calculated
on a GAAP
basis was
5 bps above
average
one-month
LIBOR and
9 bps below
average six-month
LIBOR for
the
quarter ended
December
31, 2021.
Our average
economic cost
of funds
was 468 bps
above average
one-month
LIBOR and
454 bps
above average
six-month LIBOR
for the quarter
ended December
31, 2021.
The average
term to maturity
of the outstanding
repurchase
agreements
decreased
from 33
days at December
31, 2020
to 16 days
at December
31, 2021.

million for
the years
ended
December

was 3.66%
compared
to 4.22%
for the year

quarterly
and set
at a spread
of 3.50%
over the
prevailing
three-month
LIBOR rate
on the determination
date.
As of

Note Payable
On October 30, 2019,
the Company borrowed $680,000 from a bank. The note is payable in equal
monthly principal and interest
installments of approximately $4,500 through October 30, 2039. Interest accrues
at 4.89% through October 30, 2024. Thereafter,
interest accrues based on the weekly average yield to the United States Treasury securities adjusted to
a constant maturity of 5 years,

We invest in
MBS with
the intent
to earn net
income from
the realized
yield on those
assets over
their related
funding and
hedging
costs, and
not for the
purpose of
making short
term gains
from trading
in these securities.
However, we
have sold,
and may continue
to
sell, existing
assets to
acquire
new assets,
which our
management
believes might
have higher
risk-adjusted
returns in
light of current
or
anticipated
interest
rates, federal
government
programs
or general
economic conditions
or to manage
our balance
sheet as
part of our
asset/liability
management
strategy.
During the
year ended
December 31,
2021, we
received proceeds
of $13.1
million from
the sales
of
MBS compared
to $176.2
million for
the year
ended December
31, 2020.
Most of the
2020 sales
occurred
during the
second half
of March
2020 as we
sold assets
in order
to maintain
our leverage
ratio at
prudent levels,
maintain sufficient
cash and liquidity
and reduce
risk
associated
with the
market turmoil
brought about
by COVID-19.
The fair
value of our
MBS portfolio
and derivative
instruments,
and the gains
(losses) reported
on those
financial
instruments,
are
sensitive
to changes
in interest
rates.

our MBS portfolio
consisted
of $60.8
million of
agency or
government
MBS at fair
value and
had a
weighted
average coupon
of 3.41%.
During the

we received
principal
repayments
of $14.5
million
compared
to $13.9
million for
the year
ended December

2021 and
2020 were
21.1% and
14.4%,
respectively.
The following
table presents
the three-month
constant prepayment
rate (“CPR”)
experienced

a mortgage
pool that
assumes that
a constant
fraction
of the remaining
principal
is prepaid
each month
or year. Specifically,
the CPR

Effective duration is the approximate percentage change in price
for a 100 bp change in rates.
An effective duration of 2.103 indicates that an
interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 2.103% decrease in the value
of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December
31, 2021.
An effective duration of 3.309 indicates that an interest rate increase
of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 3.309% decrease in the
value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2020. These figures
include the structured securities in the portfolio but do include
the effect of our funding cost hedges. Effective duration quotes
for individual investments are obtained from The Yield

Our portfolio
of PT MBS
is typically
comprised
of adjustable-rate
MBS, fixed-rate
MBS and hybrid
adjustable-rate
MBS. We generally
seek to acquire
low duration
assets that
offer high
levels of
protection
from mortgage
prepayments
provided
that they
are reasonably
priced by
the market.
The stated
contractual
final maturity
of the mortgage
loans underlying
our portfolio
of PT MBS
generally ranges
up
to 30 years.
However, the
effect of prepayments
of the underlying
mortgage
loans tends
to shorten
the resulting
cash flows
from our
investments
substantially.
Prepayments
occur for
various reasons,
including
refinancing
of underlying
mortgages,
loan payoffs
in
connection
with home
sales, and
borrowers
paying more
than their
scheduled
loan payments,
which accelerates
the amortization
of the
loans.
The duration
of our IO
and IIO portfolio
will vary
greatly depending
on the structural
features
of the securities.
While prepayment
activity will
always affect
the cash
flows associated
with the
securities,
the interest
only nature
of IO’s may
cause their
durations
to become
extremely
negative when
prepayments
are high,
and less negative
when prepayments
are low. Prepayments
affect the
durations
of IIO’s
similarly, but the
floating rate
nature of
the coupon
of IIOs (which
is inversely
related to
the level
of one month
LIBOR) cause
their price
movements
- and model
duration
- to be affected
by changes
in both
prepayments
and one month
LIBOR - both
current and
anticipated
levels.
As a result,
the duration
of IIO securities
will also
vary greatly.
Prepayments
on the loans
underlying
our MBS
can alter
the timing
of the cash
flows received
by us. As
a result,
we gauge
the interest
rate sensitivity
of its assets
by measuring
their effective
duration.
While modified
duration
measures
the price
sensitivity
of a bond
to
movements
in interest
rates, effective
duration
captures
both the
movement in
interest
rates and
the fact
that cash
flows to
a mortgage
related security
are altered
when interest
rates move.
Accordingly, when
the contract
interest
rate on a
mortgage
loan is substantially
above prevailing
interest
rates in
the market,
the effective
duration
of securities
collateralized
by such loans
can be quite
low because
of
expected prepayments.
We face the
risk that
the market
value of our
PT MBS assets
will increase
or decrease
at different
rates than
that of our
structured
- 50 -
MBS or liabilities,
including
our hedging
instruments.
Accordingly, we
assess our
interest
rate risk
by estimating
the duration
of our assets
and the duration
of our liabilities.
We generally
calculate
duration
and effective
duration
using various
third-party
models or
obtain these
quotes from
third-parties.
However, empirical
results and
various third-party
models may
produce
different duration
numbers for
the same
securities.
The following
sensitivity
analysis
shows the
estimated
impact on
the fair
value of our
interest
rate-sensitive
investments
and hedge
positions
as of December
31, 2021,
assuming rates
instantaneously
fall 100 bps,
rise 100
bps and
rise 200
bps, adjusted
to reflect
the
impact of
convexity, which
is the
measure of
the sensitivity
of our hedge
positions
and Agency
MBS’ effective
duration to
movements
in
interest
rates.

In addition
to changes
in interest

Repurchase Agreements
As of December
31, 2021,
we had established
borrowing
facilities
in the repurchase
agreement
market with
a number
of commercial
banks and
other financial
institutions
and had borrowings
in place with
five of these
counterparties.
We believe
these facilities
provide
borrowing
capacity in
excess of
our needs.
None of these
lenders are
affiliated
with the
Company. These borrowings
are secured
by our
MBS and cash.
As of December
31, 2021,
we had obligations
outstanding
under the
repurchase
agreements
of approximately
$58.9 million
with a net
weighted
average borrowing
cost of 0.14%.
The remaining
maturity of
our outstanding
repurchase
agreement
obligations
ranged from
6 to
45 days, with
a weighted
average maturity
of 16 days.
Securing
the repurchase
agreement
obligation
as of December
31, 2021
are MBS
with an estimated
fair value,
including
accrued interest,
of $61.0 million
and a weighted
average maturity
of 330 months,
and cash
posted
as collateral
of $1.4 million.
Through
March 11, 2022,
we have been
able to maintain
our repurchase
facilities
with comparable
terms to
those that
existed at
December
31, 2021
with maturities
through May
16, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is
our ability
to turn non-cash
assets into
cash, purchase
additional
investments,
repay principal
and interest
on borrowings,
fund overhead
and fulfill
margin calls.
We have both
internal
and external
sources of
liquidity. However,
our material
unused sources
of
liquidity
include cash
balances,
unencumbered
assets and
our ability
to sell encumbered
assets to
raise cash.
At the onset
of the COVID-
19 pandemic
in the spring
of 2020,
the markets
the Company
operates
in were severely
disrupted
and the Company
was forced
to rely on
these sources
of liquidity. Our
balance sheet
also generates
liquidity
on an on-going
basis through
payments of
principal
and interest
we
receive on
our MBS
portfolio
and dividends
we receive
on our investment
in Orchid
common stock.
Internal
Sources of
Liquidity
Our internal
sources of
liquidity
include our
cash balances,
unencumbered
assets and
our ability
to liquidate
our encumbered
security
holdings.
Our balance
sheet also
generated
liquidity
on an ongoing
basis through
payments
of principal
and interest
we receive
on our
MBS portfolio
and dividends
we receive
on our investment
in Orchid
common stock.
We have previously,
and may
again in the
future, employ
a hedging
strategy
that typically
involves
taking short
positions
in Eurodollar
futures,
T-Note futures,
TBAs or other
instruments.
When the
market causes
these short
positions
to decline
in value we
are required
to
meet margin
calls with
cash.
This can
reduce our
liquidity
position
to the extent
other securities
in our portfolio
move in price
in such a
way
that we do
not receive
enough cash
through margin
calls to offset
the Eurodollar
related margin
calls. If
this were
to occur
in sufficient
magnitude,
the loss of
liquidity
might force
us to reduce
the size
of the levered
portfolio,
pledge additional
structured
securities
to raise
funds or
risk operating
the portfolio
with less
liquidity.
External
Sources of
Liquidity
Our primary
external
sources of
liquidity
are our ability
to (i) borrow
under master
repurchase
agreements
and (ii)
use the TBA
security
market. Our
borrowing
capacity will
vary over
time as the
market value
of our interest
earning assets
varies. Our
master repurchase
agreements
have no stated
expiration,
but can be
terminated
at any time
at our option
or at the
option of
the counterparty.
However, once
a definitive
repurchase
agreement
under a master
repurchase
agreement
has been
entered into,
it generally
may not be
terminated
by
either party.
A negotiated
termination
can occur, but
may involve
a fee to be
paid by the
party seeking
to terminate
the repurchase
agreement
transaction.
Under our
repurchase
agreement
funding arrangements,
we are required
to post margin
at the initiation
of the borrowing.
The margin
posted represents
the haircut,
which is a
percentage
of the market
value of the
collateral
pledged.
To the extent the
market value
of the
asset collateralizing
the financing
transaction
declines,
the market
value of our
posted margin
will be insufficient
and we will
be required
to
post additional
collateral.
Conversely, if
the market
value of the
asset pledged
increases
in value,
we would
be over collateralized
and we
would be
entitled to
have excess
margin returned
to us by the
counterparty.
Our lenders
typically
value our
pledged securities
daily to
ensure the
adequacy of
our margin
and make margin
calls as
needed, as
do we.
Typically, but not always,
the parties
agree to
a minimum
threshold
amount for
margin calls
so as to avoid
the need
for nuisance
margin calls
on a daily
basis. Our
master repurchase
agreements
do not specify
the haircut;
rather haircuts
are determined
on an individual
repurchase
transaction
basis.
- 52 -
As discussed
above, we
invest a
portion of
our capital
in structured
MBS.
We generally
do not apply
leverage
to this portion
of our
portfolio.
The leverage
inherent
in structured
securities
replaces
the leverage
obtained by
acquiring
PT securities
and funding
them in the
repurchase
market.
This structured
MBS strategy
has been
a core element
of the Company’s
overall investment
strategy
since 2008.
However, we
have and
may continue
to pledge
a portion
of our structured
MBS in order
to raise our
cash levels,
but generally
will not
pledge these
securities
in order
to acquire
additional
assets.
In future
periods we
expect to
continue to
finance our
activities
through repurchase
agreements.
As of December
31, 2021,
we had
cash and cash
equivalents
of $8.4
million.
We generated
cash flows
of $16.7
million from
principal
and interest
payments on
our MBS
portfolio
and had average
repurchase
agreements
outstanding
of $67.4
million during
the year
ended December
31, 2021.
In addition,
during the
year ended
December
31, 2021,
we received
approximately
$9.4 million
in management
fees and
expense reimbursements
as
manager of
Orchid and
approximately
$2.0 million
in dividends
from our
investment
in Orchid
common stock.
In order
to generate
additional
cash to be
invested in
our MBS
portfolio,
on October
30, 2019,
we obtained
a $680,000
loan secured
by a mortgage
on the Company’s
office property.
The loan
is payable
in equal monthly
principal
and interest
installments
of approximately
$4,500 through
October 30,
2039. Interest
accrued at
4.89%, through
October 30,
2024. Thereafter,
interest
accrued based
on the weekly
average yield
to the United
States Treasury
securities
adjusted
to a constant
maturity of
five years,
plus 3.25%.
Net loan
proceeds
were
approximately
$651,000.
In addition,
during 2020,
we completed
the sale of
real property
that was
not used
in the Company’s
business.
The net proceeds
from this
sale were
approximately
$462,000 and
were invested
in our MBS
portfolio.
Outlook
Orchid Island
Capital Inc.
To the extent Orchid
is able to
increase
its capital
base over
time, we
will benefit
via increased
management
fees.
In addition,
Orchid
is obligated
to reimburse
us for direct
expenses paid
on its behalf
and to pay
to us Orchid’s
pro rata
share of
overhead
as defined
in the
management
agreement.
As a stockholder
of Orchid,
we will also
continue to
share in
distributions,
if any, paid by
Orchid to
its
stockholders.
Our operating
results are
also impacted
by changes
in the market
value of our
holdings of
Orchid common
shares,
although
these market
value changes
do not impact
our cash
flows from
Orchid.
The independent
Board of
Directors
of Orchid
has the ability
to terminate
the management
agreement
and thus
end our ability
to
collect management
fees and
share overhead
costs.
Should Orchid
terminate
the management
agreement
without cause,
it will be
obligated
to pay us
a termination
fee equal
to three
times the
average annual
management
fee, as
defined in
the management
agreement,
before or
on the last
day of the
current automatic
renewal term.
Economic Summary
COVID-19 continued to impact the United States and the rest of the world during
the fourth quarter of 2021 and into the first
quarter of 2022.
The most recent variant, Omicron, spreads much more readily
than past variants, but also tends to be much less
severe.
Instances of new cases spiked rapidly, starting in December of 2021 and peaked, in the U.S., the week ended January 16,
2022 at 5.58 million.
Since then, cases have declined fairly rapidly, as have hospitalizations, which have also tended to involve much
shorter stays in the hospital, especially in comparison to the Delta variant.
Despite the Omicron wave, the economy added 481,000
jobs in January 2022, 678,000 jobs in February 2022 and January retail sales also
rose well above estimates at 3.8%, causing the
markets and the Fed to meaningfully revise expectations for the path of monetary
policy in 2022 and beyond.
The rationale for the shift in expectations for monetary policy was found
in the economic data that was released during the fourth
quarter of 2021.
There were several economic indicators that reached milestone
levels and made it clear the economy had more than
recovered from the pandemic.
The Fed focuses on two areas of economic performance - inflation and the labor market
- tied to their
dual mandates of stable prices and maximum employment.
With respect to inflation, the year-over-year consumer price index reading
- 53 -
increased from the 4% increase reported in September of 2021 to 5.43%
in December of 2021. Core personal consumption
expenditures - the Fed’s preferred inflation measure - increased from 3.7% year-over-year
to 4.85% between September and
December of 2021. In the latter case, this was the highest reading since the
early 1980s.
The producer price index was also increasing
rapidly - approaching 7% year over year in December of 2021.
This led the Fed to formally declare that their assessment of inflation
as “transitory” was no longer the case.
Labor market indicators also reached new milestones. Initial claims for
unemployment insurance breached the 200,000 level
during the fourth quarter of 2021-
the first time this happened since the late 1960s.
Continuing claims for unemployment insurance
reached levels even lower than the lows reached prior to the pandemic,
and the unemployment rate reached 3.9% in December, still
0.4% above the lowest level reached prior to the pandemic but
below the Fed’s long-term target level and their proxy for full
employment.
The final piece of information was gross domestic product growth
of 6.9% for the fourth quarter, released in January of
2022.
The Fed’s outlook for monetary policy pivoted materially beginning in November
of 2021.
The economic data has strengthened further in early 2022.
In particular, measures of inflation have accelerated from the trend of
late 2021 and are very broad based, as prices for essentially every category
of goods and services are accelerating.
The employment
data has also been very strong, exhibiting little effect from the Omicron variant. The
combination of accelerating inflation well above the
Fed’s target level and a very tight labor market have led the market to anticipate the Fed will react
aggressively soon. The Fed has
signaled they are about to start an accelerated removal of the extreme monetary accommodation
necessitated by the pandemic.
In
January of 2022 the FOMC announced they would end their asset purchases
in March of 2022 and were likely to start decreasing the
reinvestment of their U.S. Treasury and MBS assets as they matured or were repaid starting shortly after their
first rate hike. The first
rate hike is likely to be in March as well. Current pricing in the futures market
indicates the Fed will increase the Fed Funds rate at least
five times by January of 2023 and by approximately 75 basis points more in 2023.
Based solely on domestic economic developments of late the Fed is likely to aggressively
remove their accommodative monetary
policy. However, a potentially significant geo-political development has unfolded in the Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on February
24, 2022. The United States and several NATO allies have imposed significant economic sanctions that are likely to cripple the
Russian economy and currency, the Ruble. Should the situation deteriorate further and military action lead to a protracted
war, there
would likely be an economic impact on Europe and therefore indirectly in the U.S., potentially
slowing economic activity at the margin
and possibly lessening the need for the Fed to remove monetary policy
as aggressively as expected otherwise.
Legislative Response and the Federal Reserve
Congress passed the CARES Act (described below) quickly in response to
the pandemic’s emergence during the spring of 2020.
As provisions of the CARES Act expired and the effects of the pandemic continued
to adversely impact the country, the federal
government passed an additional stimulus package in late December of 2020. Further, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into
law an additional $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package as part of the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
This law provided for, among
other things, direct payments to most Americans with a gross income of less
than $75,000 a year, expansion of the child tax credit,
extension of expanded unemployment benefits through September 6, 2021, funding
for procurement of vaccines and health providers,
loans to qualified businesses, funding for rental and mortgage assistance and
funding for schools. The expanded federal
unemployment benefits expired on September 6, 2021.
In addition, the Fed provided as much support to the markets and the economy
as it could within the constraints of its mandate.
During the third quarter of 2020, the Fed unveiled a new monetary policy framework
focused on average inflation rate targeting
that allows the Fed Funds rate to remain quite low, even if inflation is expected to temporarily surpass the 2% target
level. Further, the
Fed stated they would look past the presence of very tight labor markets,
should they be present at the time.
This marks a significant
shift from their prior policy framework, which was focused on the unemployment
rate as a key indicator of impending inflation.
Adherence to this policy could steepen the U.S. Treasury curve as short-term rates could remain low for a
considerable period but
longer-term rates could rise given the Fed’s intention to let inflation potentially run above
2% in the future as the economy more fully
- 54 -
recovers.
As mentioned above, this policy shift will not likely have an effect on current
monetary policy as inflation is now running
considerably higher than the Fed’s 2% target level and the Fed appears likely to move quickly
to remove the extreme monetary
accommodation they provided as the pandemic emerged in the U.S. in the
spring of 2020.
Interest Rates
At the beginning of 2021, interest rates were still close to the lowest levels
ever observed.
As the country and economy emerged
from the effects of the pandemic and the federal government and the Fed took unprecedented
actions to buttress the economy from
the effects of the pandemic, interest rates increased over the course of the year.
Increases in interest rates were not uniform over the
year as shorter maturity rates, typically more sensitive to anticipated increases in
short term rates controlled by the Fed, increased
more than longer term rates.
As inflation accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2021, and even more so in early
2022, this trend
intensified and the spread between certain intermediate rates - such as 5-year
and 7-year maturities - trade at yields only marginally
below longer-term rates such as 10-year U.S. Treasuries.
This flattening of the rates curve is typical as the economy strengthens
and
the market anticipates increases in short-term rates by the Fed. As economic and/or
inflation data strengthen and the market
anticipates progressively more increases in short-term rates, this flattening effect
intensifies as well. Eventually the rates curve could
actually invert, whereby the intermediate rates mentioned above actually yield
more than longer-term rates.
This would occur when the
market anticipates the increases to short-term rates by the Fed will actually slow the
economy too much in the future and a possible
recession is on the horizon.
However, recent developments in the Ukraine have reversed some of the compression in the treasury
curve as shorter term rates have decreased more than longer-term rates, a sign of
a “flight to quality” rally as investors across the
globe seek the safety of short-term US treasury securities in times of duress.
Given the unprecedented nature of the monetary and
fiscal stimulus needed to combat the pandemic and the related supercharged
effect on the economy, the current recovery and pending
rate increase cycle will be even more difficult to manage by the Fed and we expect that such
an outcome is more likely to occur than in
past cycles.
The Agency MBS Market
As was anticipated, the Fed announced a tapering of their U.S.
Treasury and Agency MBS asset purchases at their November
2021 meeting.
As described above, the forthcoming data was likely to necessitate an accelerated
pace of accommodation removal
and in December of 2021, and again in January of 2022, the Fed announced
revised schedules for tapering.
This means a material
source of demand for Agency MBS is about to leave the market.
Given Fed purchases are a source of reserves into the banking
system, this also means banks, which have also been a material source
for Agency MBS, may also be buying fewer securities.
However, the securities that were the focus of the Fed and bank buying, namely production coupon securities, performed
relatively well
during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Total
returns for Agency MBS for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021
were -0.4% and -1.2%, respectively.
Agency
MBS returns generally trailed other major domestic fixed income categories.
High yield debt returned 0.7% and 5.4% for the quarter
and year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Investment grade returns for the same two periods were 0.2% and -1.0%,
respectively.
Legacy non-Agency MBS returns were equal to or exceeded high yield returns.
Relative to comparable duration U.S.
Treasuries Agency MBS returns were -1.0% and -1.6%, respectively for the same two periods.
Again, these returns trailed the same
other major domestic fixed-income categories and by comparable amounts.
Within the Agency MBS 30-year coupons, production
coupons - 2.0% and 2.5% - outperformed higher, liquid securities - 3.0% and 3.5% - both on absolute
terms and relative to
comparable duration U.S. Treasuries for the fourth quarter of 2021.
Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments
The Fed conducted large scale overnight repo operations from late 2019 until
July 2020 to address disruptions in the U.S.
Treasury, Agency debt and Agency MBS financing markets. These operations ceased in July 2020 after the central bank successfully
tamed volatile funding costs that had threatened to cause disruption across the
financial system.
- 55 -
The Fed has taken a number of other actions to stabilize markets as a result
of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March
15, 2020, the Fed announced a $700 billion asset purchase program to provide
liquidity to the U.S. Treasury and Agency MBS
markets. Specifically, the Fed announced that it would purchase at least $500 billion of U.S. Treasuries and at least $200 billion of
Agency MBS. The Fed also lowered the Fed Funds rate to a range of 0.0% - 0.25%,
after having already lowered the Fed Funds rate
by 50 bps on March 3, 2020. On June 30, 2020, Fed Chairman Powell announced
expectations to maintain interest rates at this level
until the Fed is confident that the economy has weathered recent events
and is on track to achieve maximum employment and price
stability goals. The Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) continued to reaffirm this commitment
at all subsequent meetings
through December of 2021, as well as an intention to allow inflation to climb modestly
above their 2% target and maintain that level for
a period sufficient for inflation to average 2% long term. On January 26, 2022, the FOMC reiterated
its goals of maximum employment
and a 2% long-run inflation rate and stated that, with a strong labor market
and inflation well above 2%, it expected it would soon be
appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain and minimize its
impact resulted in the deterioration of the markets for
U.S. Treasuries, Agency MBS and other mortgage and fixed income markets. As a result, investors liquidated
significant holdings in
these assets. In response, on March 23, 2020, the Fed announced a program
to acquire U.S. Treasuries and Agency MBS in the
amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. With these purchases, market
conditions improved substantially, and in early
April, the Fed began to gradually reduce the pace of these purchases. Through
November of 2021, the Fed was committed to
purchasing $80 billion of U.S. Treasuries and $40 billion of Agency MBS each month. In November of 2021,
it began tapering its net
asset purchases each month, reducing them to $70 billion, $60 billion and $40
billion of U.S. Treasuries and $35 billion, $30 billion and
$20 billion of Agency MBS in November of 2021, December of 2021 and January
of 2022, respectively.
On January 26, 2022, the
FOMC announced that it would continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasuries by $20
billion per month and its holdings of Agency
MBS by $10 billion per month for February of 2022 and would end its net asset
purchases entirely by early March of 2022.
The CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020.
The CARES Act provided
many forms of direct support to individuals and small businesses in order to stem the
steep decline in economic activity.
This over $2
trillion COVID-19 relief bill, among other things, provided for direct payments to
each American making up to $75,000 a year, increased
unemployment benefits for up to four months (on top of state benefits), funding
to hospitals and health providers, loans and
investments to businesses, states and municipalities and grants to the airline
industry. On April 24, 2020, President Trump signed an
additional funding bill into law that provides an additional $484 billion of funding
to individuals, small businesses, hospitals, health care
providers and additional coronavirus testing efforts. Various provisions of the CARES Act began to expire in July 2020, including a
moratorium on evictions (July 25, 2020), expanded unemployment benefits (July
31, 2020), and a moratorium on foreclosures (August
31, 2020). On August 8, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13945, directing the Department
of Health and Human
Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”),
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and
Department of the Treasury to take measures to temporarily halt residential evictions and foreclosures,
including through temporary
financial assistance.
On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law an additional $900 billion coronavirus aid package
as part of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, providing for extensions of
many of the CARES Act policies and programs as well as additional
relief. The package provided for, among other things, direct payments to most Americans with a gross income of less
than $75,000 a
year, extension of unemployment benefits through March 14, 2021, funding for procurement of vaccines and health providers,
loans to
qualified businesses, funding for rental assistance and funding for schools.
On January 29, 2021, the CDC issued guidance extending
eviction moratoriums for covered persons through March 31, 2021. The FHFA subsequently extended the foreclosure
moratorium
begun under the CARES Act for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac and the eviction moratorium for real estate owned by
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac until July 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development
Department subsequently extended the FHA foreclosure and eviction moratoria
to July 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively.
Despite the expirations of these foreclosure moratoria, a final rule adopted by
the CFPB on June 28, 2021 effectively prohibited
servicers from initiating a foreclosure before January 1, 2022 in most instances.

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law an additional $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package as part of the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
This law provided for, among other things, direct payments to most Americans with a gross income of less
than $75,000 a year, expansion of the child tax credit, extension of expanded unemployment benefits through September
6, 2021,
funding for procurement of vaccines and health providers, loans to qualified businesses,
funding for rental and mortgage assistance
and funding for schools. The expanded federal unemployment benefits expired on September
6, 2021.
In January 2019, the Trump administration made statements of its plans to work with Congress
to overhaul Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac and expectations to announce a framework for the development of
a policy for comprehensive housing finance reform
soon. On September 30, 2019, the FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed
to increase their capital buffers
to $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively, from the prior limit of $3 billion each. This step could ultimately lead to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac being privatized and represents the first concrete step on the road to
GSE reform.
On June 30, 2020, the FHFA released
a proposed rule on a new regulatory framework for the GSEs which seeks to implement
both a risk-based capital framework and
minimum leverage capital requirements. The final rule on the new capital framework
for the GSEs was published in the federal register
in December 2020.
On January 14, 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA executed letter agreements allowing the GSEs to continue
to retain capital up to their regulatory minimums, including buffers, as prescribed in the December
rule.
These letter agreements
provide, in part, (i) there will be no exit from conservatorship until all
material litigation is settled and the GSE has common equity Tier 1
capital of at least 3% of its assets, (ii) the GSEs will comply with
the FHFA’s
regulatory capital framework, (iii) higher-risk single-family
mortgage acquisitions will be restricted to current levels, and (iv) the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA will establish a timeline and process
for future GSE reform. However, no definitive proposals or legislation have been released or enacted with respect
to ending the
conservatorship, unwinding the GSEs, or materially reducing the roles of the GSEs
in the U.S. mortgage market. On September 14,
2021, the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA suspended certain policy provisions in the January agreement, including limits on loans
acquired for cash consideration, multifamily loans, loans with higher risk
characteristics and second homes and investment properties.
On September 15, 2021, the FHFA announced a notice of proposed rulemaking for the purpose of amending the December
rule to,
among other things, reduce the Tier 1 capital and risk-weight floor requirements.
In 2017, policymakers announced that LIBOR would be replaced by December
31, 2021. The directive was spurred by the fact that
banks are uncomfortable contributing to the LIBOR panel given the shortage of underlying
transactions on which to base levels and the
liability associated with submitting an unfounded level. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its
capacity as administrator of
USD LIBOR, has announced that it intends to extend publication of USD LIBOR (other
than one-week and two-month tenors) by 18
months to June 2023.
Notwithstanding this possible extension, a joint statement by key regulatory
authorities calls on banks to cease
entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by no
later than December 31, 2021. The ARRC, a steering
committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has proposed replacing
USD-LIBOR with a new SOFR, a rate based on U.S.
repo trading. Many banks believe that it may take four to five years to complete
the transition to SOFR, despite the December 31, 2021
deadline. We will monitor the emergence of SOFR carefully as it appears likely to become
the new benchmark for hedges and a range
of interest rate investments. At this time, however, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives
to
LIBOR.
On December 7, 2021, the CFPB released a final rule that amends Regulation
Z, which implemented the Truth in Lending Act,
aimed at addressing cessation of LIBOR for both closed-end (e.g., home mortgage) and
open-end (e.g., home equity line of credit)
products. The rule, which mostly becomes effective in April of 2022, establishes requirements
for the selection of replacement indices
for existing LIBOR-linked consumer loans. Although the rule does not mandate
the use of SOFR as the alternative rate, it identifies
SOFR as a comparable rate for closed-end products and states that for open-end products,
the CFPB has determined that ARRC’s
recommended spread-adjusted indices based on SOFR for consumer products
to replace the one-month, three-month, or six-month
USD LIBOR index “have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar to
those of the LIBOR indices that they are intended to
replace.” The CFPB reserved judgment, however, on a SOFR-based spread-adjusted replacement
index to replace the one-year USD
LIBOR until it obtained additional information.
- 57 -
On December 8, 2021, the House of Representatives passed the Adjustable Interest
Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021 (H.R. 4616) (the
“LIBOR Act”), which provides for a statutory replacement benchmark rate for contracts
that use LIBOR as a benchmark and do not
contain any fallback mechanism independent of LIBOR. Pursuant to the LIBOR
Act, SOFR becomes the new benchmark rate by
operation of law for any such contract. The LIBOR Act establishes a safe harbor from
litigation for claims arising out of or related to the
use of SOFR as the recommended benchmark replacement. The LIBOR Act
makes clear that it should not be construed to disfavor the
use of any benchmark on a prospective basis.
The LIBOR Act also attempts to forestall challenges that it is impairing
contracts. It provides that the discontinuance of LIBOR and
the automatic statutory transition to a replacement rate neither impairs or
affects the rights of a party to receive payment under such
contracts, nor allows a party to discharge their performance obligations or to declare
a breach of contract. It amends the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 to state that the “the right of any holder of any
indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and
interest on such indenture security shall not be deemed to be impaired or
affected” by application of the LIBOR Act to any indenture
security.
On December 9, 2021, the United States Senate referred the LIBOR Act to
the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs.
One-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates phased out on December
31, 2021, but other U.S. dollar tenors may continue
until June 30, 2023. We will monitor the emergence of SOFR carefully as it appears likely
to become the new benchmark for hedges
and a range of interest rate investments. At this time, however, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may
become accepted
alternatives to LIBOR.
Effective January 1, 2021, Fannie Mae, in alignment with Freddie Mac, extended the timeframe for
its delinquent loan buyout
policy for Single-Family Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities (UMBS)
and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) from four consecutively
missed monthly payments to twenty-four consecutively missed monthly payments (i.e.,
24 months past due). This new timeframe
applied to outstanding single-family pools and newly issued single-family pools and was
first reflected when January 2021 factors were
released on the fourth business day in February 2021.
For Agency MBS investors, when a delinquent loan is bought out of
a pool of mortgage loans, the removal of the loan from the
pool is the same as a total prepayment of the loan.
The respective GSEs anticipated, however, that delinquent loans will be
repurchased in most cases before the 24-month deadline under one of the following
exceptions listed below.
•
a loan that is paid in full, or where the related lien is released and/or the
note debt is satisfied or forgiven;
•
a loan repurchased by a seller/servicer under applicable selling and
servicing requirements;
•
a loan entering a permanent modification, which generally requires it to
be removed from the MBS. During any modification
trial period, the loan will remain in the MBS until the trial period ends;
•
a loan subject to a short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure; or
•
a loan referred to foreclosure.
Because of these exceptions, the GSEs believe based on prevailing assumptions
and market conditions this change will have only
a marginal impact on prepayment speeds, in aggregate. Cohort level impacts
may vary. For example, more than half of loans referred
to foreclosure are historically referred within six months of delinquency. The degree to which speeds are affected depends on
delinquency levels, borrower response, and referral to foreclosure timelines.
The scope and nature of the actions the U.S. government or the Fed will
ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to
evolve.
Effect on Us
Regulatory developments, movements in interest rates and prepayment rates affect us in
many ways, including the following:
- 58 -
Effects on our Assets
A change in or elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may increase our
costs (if, for example, guarantee fees
increase) or require us to change our investment strategy altogether. For example, the elimination of the guarantee structure
of Agency
MBS may cause us to change our investment strategy to focus on non-Agency
MBS, which in turn would require us to significantly
increase our monitoring of the credit risks of our investments in addition to interest rate
and prepayment risks.
Lower long-term interest rates can affect the value of our Agency MBS in a number of ways.
If prepayment rates are relatively low
(due, in part, to the refinancing problems described above), lower long-term
interest rates can increase the value of higher-coupon
Agency MBS. This is because investors typically place a premium on assets with yields
that are higher than market yields. Although
lower long-term interest rates may increase asset values in our portfolio, we
may not be able to invest new funds in similarly-yielding
assets.
If prepayment levels increase, the value of our Agency MBS affected by such prepayments
may decline. This is because a
principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency MBS, which would shorten the period
during which an investor would
receive above-market returns (assuming the yield on the prepaid asset is higher than
market yields). Also, prepayment proceeds may
not be able to be reinvested in similar-yielding assets. Agency MBS backed
by mortgages with high interest rates are more susceptible
to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are most likely to refinance
to a lower rate. IOs and IIOs, however, may be the
types of Agency MBS most sensitive to increased prepayment rates. Because the
holder of an IO or IIO receives no principal
payments, the values of IOs and IIOs are entirely dependent on the existence of a principal
balance on the underlying mortgages. If the
principal balance is eliminated due to prepayment, IOs and IIOs essentially become
worthless. Although increased prepayment rates
can negatively affect the value of our IOs and IIOs, they have the opposite effect on POs. Because POs
act like zero-coupon bonds,
meaning they are purchased at a discount to their par value and have an effective
interest rate based on the discount and the term of
the underlying loan, an increase in prepayment rates would reduce the effective term
of our POs and accelerate the yields earned on
those assets, which would increase our net income.
Higher long-term rates can also affect the value of our Agency MBS.
As long-term rates rise, rates available to borrowers also
rise.
This tends to cause prepayment activity to slow and extend the expected
average life of mortgage cash flows.
As the expected
average life of the mortgage cash flows increases, coupled with higher discount
rates, the value of Agency MBS declines.
Some of the
instruments the Company may use to hedge our Agency MBS assets, such as interest rate
futures, swaps and swaptions, are stable
average life instruments.
This means that to the extent we use such instruments to hedge
our Agency MBS assets, our hedges may
not adequately protect us from price declines, and therefore may negatively impact our
book value.
It is for this reason we use interest
only securities in our portfolio. As interest rates rise, the expected average
life of these securities increases, causing generally positive
price movements as the number and size of the cash flows increase the
longer the underlying mortgages remain outstanding. This
makes interest only securities desirable hedge instruments for pass-through
Agency MBS.
As described above, the Agency MBS market began to experience severe
dislocations in mid-March 2020 as a result of the
economic, health and market turmoil brought about by COVID-19. On March 23, 2020,
the Fed announced that it would purchase
Agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which largely
stabilized the Agency
MBS market. However, in November 2021 the Fed announced a tapering of these purchases. The Fed’s reduction of these purchases
could negatively impact our investment portfolio. Further, the moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions
described above will likely
delay potential defaults on loans that would otherwise be bought out of Agency MBS
pools as described above.
Depending on the
ultimate resolution of the foreclosures
or evictions, when and if they occur, these loans may be removed from the pool into which they
were securitized. If this were to occur, it would have the effect of delaying a prepayment on the Company’s securities until such time.
As the majority of the Company’s Agency MBS assets were acquired at a premium to
par, this will tend to increase the realized yield on
the asset in question.
- 59 -
Because we base our investment decisions on risk management principles
rather than anticipated movements in interest rates, in
a volatile interest rate environment we may allocate more capital to structured Agency
MBS with shorter durations. We believe these
securities have a lower sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates than other
asset classes. We may attempt to mitigate our
exposure to changes in long-term interest rates by investing in IOs and
IIOs, which typically have different sensitivities to changes in
long-term interest rates than PT MBS, particularly PT MBS backed
by fixed-rate mortgages.
Effects on our borrowing costs
We leverage our PT MBS portfolio and a portion of our structured Agency MBS with principal balances
through the use of short-
term repurchase agreement transactions. The interest rates on our debt
are determined by the short term interest rate markets. An
increase in the Fed Funds rate or LIBOR would increase our borrowing costs, which
could affect our interest rate spread if there is no
corresponding increase in the interest we earn on our assets. This would be
most prevalent with respect to our Agency MBS backed by
fixed rate mortgage loans because the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage loan does not
change even though market rates may
change.
In order to protect our net interest margin against increases in short-term interest rates, we
may enter into interest rate swaps,
which economically convert our floating-rate repurchase
agreement debt to fixed-rate debt, or utilize other hedging instruments
such as
Eurodollar, Fed Funds and T-Note futures contracts or interest rate swaptions.
Summary
The country and economy currently appear to be on the verge of recovering from
the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the virus
continues to infect people and often results in hospitalizations and deaths,
the effect on economic activity has decreased materially.
Coupled with unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy, the most significant combination of the two since the Second World War, the
fading effect of the pandemic is clearly causing the economy to run at unsustainable
levels, resulting in very tight labor markets and the
highest levels of inflation in decades. The Fed has begun the rapid transformation
from accommodation to constraint and will likely
begin raising short-term rates at their meeting in March of 2022.
Currently the market anticipates the Fed will continue to raise rates
throughout the year and into 2023, possibly by as much as 200 basis points.
Further, they are rapidly winding down their asset
purchases and will likely stop asset purchases altogether - possibly by the
end of the year - as they begin the process of “normalizing”
the size of their balance sheet.
Market experts estimate the Fed may have to shrink the size of their balance
sheet by up to $4 trillion,
and over a much shorter time frame than the last time they did so over the
period from 2017 to 2019.
The effect of these developments
on the level of interest rates has been a material flattening of the U.S.
Treasury curve, whereby short and intermediate term rates rise
and more so relative to longer maturity U.S. Treasuries.
For the Company, this means our funding costs are likely to rise materially over the course of 2022 and possibly into 2023.
While
longer-term maturities have not risen as much as short and intermediate term rates,
they have risen and refinancing and purchase
activity in the residential housing market is likely to slow. If this occurs, it would slow premium amortization on the Company’s Agency
MBS securities. The net effect of higher funding costs and slower premium amortization
will depend on the extent and timing of both,
but may reduce the Company’s net interest income, and perhaps materially
so, over this period.
These developments will likely impact Orchid Island Capital in a similar manner. In particular, Orchid’s ability to grow or maintain its
capital base at its current level could be adversely affected if these developments continue to
pressure Orchid’s MBS assets.
This
could slow the growth of or reduce the Company’s advisory service revenues and could reduce
the amount of dividends paid by Orchid
on its common stock.
All of the above developments are being impacted by the geo-political events in
the Ukraine which may cause the Fed to alter their
monetary policy decisions over the course of 2022 and beyond.
However, given the level of inflation and strength of the economy at
- 60 -
present, such developments would likely have to be severe in order to meaningfully
impact the path of monetary policy over the near-
term.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated
financial
statements
are prepared
in accordance
with GAAP. GAAP requires
our management
to make some
complex and
subjective
decisions
and assessments.
Our most
critical accounting
policies
involve decisions
and assessments
which could
significantly
affect reported
assets, liabilities,
revenues
and expenses.
Management
has identified
the following
as its most
critical
accounting
estimates:
Mortgage-Backed
Securities
Our investments
in MBS are
accounted
for at fair
value. We acquire
our MBS
for the purpose
of generating
long-term
returns,
and not
for the short-term
investment
of idle capital.
As discussed
in Note 14
to the financial
statements,
our MBS
are valued
using Level
2 valuations,
and such valuations
currently
are
determined
based on
independent
pricing sources
and/or third
party broker
quotes, when
available.
Because the
price estimates
may vary,
management
must make
certain
judgments
and assumptions
about the
appropriate
price to
use to calculate
the fair
values. Alternatively,
the Company
could opt
to have the
value of all
of our positions
in MBS determined
by either
an independent
third-party
or do so
internally.
In managing
our portfolio,
the Company
employs the
following
four-step
process at
each valuation
date to determine
the fair
value of our
MBS.
●
First, the
Company obtains
fair values
from subscription-based
independent
pricing services.
●
Second, the
Company requests
non-binding
quotes from
one to four
broker-dealers
for certain
MBS in order
to validate
the
values obtained
by the pricing
service. The
Company requests
these quotes
from broker-dealers
that actively
trade and
make
markets in
the respective
asset class
for which
the quote
is requested.
●
Third, the
Company reviews
the values
obtained
by the pricing
source and
the broker-dealers
for consistency
across similar
assets.
●
Finally, if the
data from
the pricing
services and
broker-dealers
is not homogenous
or if the
data obtained
is inconsistent
with
management’s
market observations,
the Company
makes a judgment
to determine
which price
appears the
most consistent
with
observed
prices from
similar assets
and selects
that price.
To the extent management
believes
that none
of the prices
are
consistent
with observed
prices for
similar assets,
which is typically
the case for
only an immaterial
portion of
our portfolio
each
quarter, the
Company may
use a third
price that
is consistent
with observed
prices for
identical
or similar
assets. In
the case
of
assets that
have quoted
prices such
as Agency
MBS backed
by fixed-rate
mortgages,
the Company
generally
uses the quoted
or
observed
market price.
For assets
such as Agency
MBS backed
by ARMs or
structured
Agency MBS,
the Company
may
determine
the price
based on
the yield
or spread
that is identical
to an observed
transaction
or a similar
asset for
which a dealer
mark or subscription-based
price has
been obtained.
Management
believes its
pricing methodology
to be consistent
with the
definition
of fair value
described
in Financial
Accounting
Standards
Board (the
“FASB”) Accounting
Standards
Codification
(“ASC”)
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements.
Income Recognition
All of our
MBS are
either PT
MBS or structured
MBS, including
CMOs, IOs,
IIOs or POs.
Income on
PT MBS,
POs and CMOs
that
contain principal
balances
is based
on the stated
interest
rate of the
security. As a
result of
accounting
for our MBS
under the fair
value
option, premium
or discount
present
at the date
of purchase
is not amortized.
For IOs,
IIOs and
CMOs that
do not contain
principal
balances,
income is
accrued based
on the carrying
value and
the effective
yield. As
cash is received
it is first
applied to
accrued interest
and then
to reduce
the carrying
value of the
security. At each
reporting
date, the
effective yield
is adjusted
prospectively
from the
reporting
- 61 -
period based
on the new
estimate of
prepayments,
current interest
rates and
current asset
prices. The
new effective
yield is
calculated
based on
the carrying
value at the
end of the
previous reporting
period, the
new prepayment
estimates
and the contractual
terms of
the
security. Changes
in fair value
of all of
our MBS
during the
period are
recorded in
earnings
and reported
as unrealized
gains or
losses on
mortgage-backed
securities
in the accompanying
consolidated
statements
of operations.
For IIO securities,
effective yield
and income
recognition
calculations
also take
into account
the index
value applicable
to the security.
Income Taxes
Income
taxes are
provided
for using
the
asset
and liability
method.
Deferred tax
assets and
liabilities
represent the
differences
between the financial
statement and income
tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted
tax rates. The measurement
of net deferred
tax assets
is adjusted
by a
valuation allowance
if, based
on the
Company’s evaluation,
it is
more likely
than not
that they
will not
be
realized. A
majority of
the Company’s
net deferred
tax assets,
which consist
primarily of
NOLs, are
expected to
be realized
over an
extended number
of years.
Management’s conclusion
is supported
by taxable
income projections
which include
forecasts of
management
fees, Orchid
dividends and
net interest
income, and
the subsequent
reinvestment of
those amounts
into the
MBS portfolio.
However,
management reassesses its valuation allowance conclusions whenever there is a material
change in taxable income projections.
