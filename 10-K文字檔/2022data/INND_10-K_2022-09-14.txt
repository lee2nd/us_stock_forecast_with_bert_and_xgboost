OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the consolidated accounts of InnerScope and its’ wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Emerging Growth Companies
The Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements include collectability of accounts receivable, accounts receivable from a related party and notes receivable from an officer, inventory allowances for slow moving or obsolete inventory and the allocation of our CEO’s compensation to the Company. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalent balances may, at certain times, exceed federally insured limits. If the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank, the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost, in whole or in part, if the bank were to fail.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant risk on its cash due to the financial position of the depository institution in which those deposits are held.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has adopted ASU 2014-09, as amended effective January 1, 2018, and determined that there was no significant impact on its revenue recognition. The core principle of ASC 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle. The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company’s revenue recognition policy standards include the following elements:
I. Identify the contract with a customer
II. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
III. Determine the transaction price
IV. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
V. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company’s contracts with customers are generally on a purchase order basis and represent obligations that are satisfied at a point in time as defined in the new guidance. Accordingly, revenue for each sale is recognized when each sale is complete, which is when the customer receives the goods and any costs incurred before this point in time, are recorded as assets to be expensed during the period the related revenue is recognized. The Company accepts prepayments on hearing aids and records the amount received as customer deposits on its’ balance sheet. When the Company delivers the hearing aid to the customer, revenue is recognized as well as the corresponding cost of sales. All goods are delivered to the customer using public carriers. Company bears any loss during transit. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had received $10,925 of customer deposits, that will be recognized after December 31, 2021, when the hearing aids are delivered to the customer.
Deferred Revenue
The Company records deferred revenues from the Consulting Agreement when cash has been received, but the related services have not been provided. Deferred revenue will be recognized when the services are provided, and the terms of the agreements have been fulfilled.
Advertising and Marketing Expenses
The Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, advertising and marketing expenses were $19,762 and $485,407, respectively.
Investment in Undivided Interest in Real Estate
The Company accounts for its’ investment in undivided interest in real estate using the equity method, as the Company is severally liable only for the indebtedness incurred with its interest in the property. The Company includes its allocated portion of net income or loss in Other income (expense) in its Statement of Operations, with the offset to the equity investment account on the balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $30,646 and $15,083, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value the carrying value of our investment in undivided interest in real estate was $1,227,733 and $1,210,526, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.
The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:
• Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company's assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.
The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, certain notes payable and notes payable - related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The following table represents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, for each fair value hierarchy level:
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future tax effects, calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment.
ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor paid, any interest or penalties.
Uncertain tax positions are measured and recorded by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized.
Earnings (loss) Per Share
The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company’s outstanding convertible debt is convertible into 4,650,854,286 and 155,226,039, respectively, shares of common stock, respectively, subject to adjustment based on changes in the Company’s stock price. This amount is not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.
