Overview
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 10, 2020 for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful.
Business Combination
Merger Agreement
On August 18, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Merger Sub, Merger Sub II and Aspiration, which was subsequently amended and restated on December 15, 2021 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Aspiration with Aspiration surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and, immediately following and as part of the same overall transaction, the surviving corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the “Second Merger”) with Merger Sub II surviving such merger. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to as the “Business Combination.” In addition, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, we will be renamed “Aspiration, Inc.” The combined company following the consummation of the Business Combination is referred to herein as “New Aspiration.”
Under the Merger Agreement, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Aspiration for $1,750,000,000 in aggregate consideration (as increased for any Equity Financing Proceeds (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in the form of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New Aspiration (“New Aspiration Class A common stock”) (valued for this purpose at $10.00 per share), of which (i) $200,000,000 (represented by 20,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock) will be initially issued into escrow in connection with the issuance of an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the subscription agreements, each dated as of August 18, 2021, between us and certain institutional investors (the “Base PIPE Investors”) immediately before the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), at a purchase price of $10.00 per share (such transaction, the “Base PIPE Investment”) and (ii) up to $77,828,400 (represented by up to 7,782,840 shares of our Class A common stock) will be initially issued into escrow for the benefit of holders (the “Conversion Stockholders”) of shares of Aspiration capital stock issued upon conversion of Aspiration’s Convertible Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Up to 27,782,840 shares of our Class A common stock issued into escrow at the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Effective Time”) will be released to New Aspiration to the extent New Aspiration is obligated to issue Additional Shares (as defined below) to the Base PIPE Investors and the former Conversion Stockholders, as applicable, and otherwise, to the prior holders of common stock, par value $0.000003 per share, of Aspiration (“Aspiration common stock”) (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the prior holders of Series X preferred stock, par value 0.000003 per share, of Aspiration (the “Aspiration Series X preferred stock”), and the Conversion Stockholders) as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time. In addition, at the First Effective Time, each share of Aspiration Series X preferred stock will convert into a share of Series X preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New Aspiration (“New Aspiration Series X preferred stock”).
Each holder of Aspiration capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (excluding any shares of Series C-4 preferred stock, par value $0.000003 per share, of Aspiration (the “Aspiration Series C-4 preferred stock”), Aspiration Series X preferred stock and Aspiration common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes to the Conversion Stockholders (“Conversion Stock”)) and each holder of a vested Aspiration option (as defined below), in each case, as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time (collectively, the “Earn Out Participants”) will also receive a contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of up to 100,000,000 shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock (the “Earn Out Shares”). The Merger Agreement contemplates that the Earn Out Participants, following the Closing and for a period of five years thereafter (the “Earn Out Period”), will be eligible to receive a one-time issuance of Earn Out Shares, which shall be issued to the Earn Out Participants in five equal tranches of 20,000,000 shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock (x) when the price of New Aspiration Class A common stock equals or exceeds (i) $12.50 per share prior to the 18-month anniversary of the date on which the Closing occurs (the “Closing Date”), (ii) $15.00 per share prior to the 36-month anniversary of the Closing Date, (iii) $17.50 per share prior to the 36-month anniversary of the Closing Date, (iv) $20.00 per share prior to the 48-month anniversary of the Closing Date and (v) $25.00 per share prior to the 60-month anniversary of the Closing Date, in each case, measured as the volume-weighted average closing sale price over any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the end of the relevant time period applicable to each such earn out tranche or (y) when New Aspiration consummates a change of control transaction that entitles its stockholders to receive a per share consideration of at least $12.50, $15.00, $17.50, $20.00 and $25.00, as applicable. Any unearned portion of the Earn Out Shares not earned prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date will be forfeited.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the First Effective Time, the stock consideration to be issued to the then current holders of Aspiration capital stock (other than Aspiration Series X preferred stock) will be in the form of New Aspiration Class A common stock, and the stock consideration to be issued to the then current holders of Aspiration Series X preferred stock will be in the form of New Aspiration Series X preferred stock. Additionally, each option to purchase shares of Aspiration common stock (an “Aspiration option”) that is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will be assumed by New Aspiration and converted into an option to acquire shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock with the same terms and conditions as applied to the Aspiration option immediately prior to the First Effective Time; provided that the number of shares underlying such New Aspiration option will be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Aspiration common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the First Effective Time by the ratio determined by dividing the per share merger consideration value by $10.00 (the quotient being the “option exchange ratio”), which product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and the per share exercise price of such New Aspiration option will be determined by dividing the per share exercise price immediately prior to the First Effective Time by the option exchange ratio, which quotient shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of Aspiration common stock that is issued and outstanding prior to the First Effective Time will be either (A) converted into shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock and in connection therewith such underlying warrant to purchase shares of Aspiration common stock will be treated as if it was exercised or terminated prior to the First Effective Time in accordance with its terms or (B) assumed by New Aspiration and converted into a warrant to purchase shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock and (ii) prior to the First Effective Time, each Convertible Note will be converted into Aspiration capital stock, paid off in accordance with the terms thereof or remain outstanding and be assumed as indebtedness of New Aspiration without the right to convert into capital stock of New Aspiration. Effective upon the occurrence of the Second Merger and to the extent not otherwise paid off at the Closing, New Aspiration will assume any outstanding indebtedness of Aspiration (including with respect to the Convertible Notes that remain outstanding) and New Aspiration will be the obligor on such indebtedness.
The parties to the Merger Agreement have made customary representations and warranties and have agreed to certain customary covenants for a transaction of this type. The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to the adoption by our stockholders and Aspiration’s stockholders of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain circumstances, including if the Business Combination has not occurred by May 18, 2022 (as may be extended to July 19, 2022 if the registration statement with respect to the approval of the Business Combination by our stockholders has not become effective under the Securities Act by April 18, 2022).
Subscription Agreements
In connection with the Business Combination, we entered into subscription agreements with the Base PIPE Investors (the “Base Subscription Agreements”), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to issue and sell, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “PIPE Committed Shares”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate consideration of $200,000,000, and we entered into subscription agreements (the “Subsequent Subscription Agreements”) with certain other investors (the “Subsequent PIPE Investors” and, together with the Base PIPE Investors, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to issue and sell, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 1,363,636 shares of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of $11.00 per share for an aggregate consideration of $15,000,000. We refer to the Base Subscription Agreements and the Subsequent Subscription Agreements collectively as the “Subscription Agreements.”
Pursuant to the terms of the Base Subscription Agreements and the Conversion Stockholder Side Letters (as defined below), if during the last 10 trading days of the 60-day period following the effectiveness of the re-sale registration statement that New Aspiration has agreed to file with the SEC pursuant to the Subscription Agreements (the “Adjustment Period”), the volume weighted average price of one share of New Aspiration Class A common stock (as reported on the New York Stock Exchange) (the “Adjustment Period VWAP”) is less than $10.00 per share, each Base PIPE Investor and former Conversion Stockholder, as applicable, will be entitled to receive from New Aspiration, for no additional consideration, a number of additional shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock (the “Additional Shares”) equal to the product of (x) (i) with respect to each Base PIPE Investor, the number of PIPE Committed Shares issued to such Base PIPE Investor at the Closing that such Base PIPE Investor holds through the last day of the Adjustment Period or (ii) with respect to the former Conversion Stockholders, the number of shares of Aspiration capital stock issued upon conversion of such former Conversion Stockholder’s Convertible Notes (“Conversion Stock”) and any Convertible Notes which such former Conversion Stockholder continues to hold through the last day of the Adjustment Period, in each case, multiplied by (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is $10.00 minus the Adjustment Period VWAP and (B) the denominator of which is the Adjustment Period VWAP; provided that, with respect to the Base PIPE Investors, in no event shall the number of Additional Shares exceed the lesser of (i) the number of PIPE Committed Shares and (ii) such Base PIPE Investor’s pro rata portion of 20,000,000 shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock; provided further that, with respect to the former Conversion Stockholders, in no event shall the number of Additional Shares issuable in respect of Conversion Stock exceed 7,782,840 shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock. If the Additional Shares are issued to the Base PIPE Investors and the former Conversion Stockholders, as applicable, there will be a corresponding adjustment to the portion of the aggregate consideration held in escrow to be released to the prior holders of Aspiration common stock (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the prior holders of Aspiration Series X preferred stock and the Conversion Stockholders) as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time such that the number of issued and outstanding shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock will not change.
Conversion Stockholder Side Letters
On December 15, 2021, we and each of the Conversion Stockholders entered into amendments to certain side letter agreements (the “Conversion Stockholder Side Letters”), pursuant to which, among other things, in the event that the Adjustment Period VWAP is less than $10.00 per share of New Aspiration Class A common stock, each former Conversion Stockholder will be entitled to receive from New Aspiration, for no additional consideration, a number of shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock issued to such Conversion Stockholder at the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Conversion Stockholder Committed Shares”) that such former Conversion Stockholder holds through the Adjustment Period (as defined below), multiplied by (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is $10.00 minus the Adjustment Period VWAP, and (B) the denominator of which is the Adjustment Period VWAP (such additional shares, the “Conversion Stockholder Additional Shares”); provided that in no event shall the number of Conversion Stockholder Additional Shares exceed the product of 1.00 multiplied by the number of Conversion Stockholder Committed Shares of which such former Conversion Stockholder continues to be the record and beneficial owner through the Adjustment Period or 7,782,840 shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock in the aggregate.
Pursuant to the Conversion Stockholder Side Letters, in the event that the former Conversion Stockholders are issued Conversion Stockholder Additional Shares, each former Conversion Stockholder will have the same registration rights with respect to the Conversion Stockholder Additional Shares as the PIPE Investors have with respect to the resale of the Additional Shares. If a former Conversion Stockholder, in good faith and on the advice of its counsel, determines that it is an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of either us or New Aspiration either at the Closing or at the time the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are submitted for a vote or consent, such former Conversion Stockholder will have the same registration rights with respect to the Conversion Stockholder Committed Shares as the PIPE Investors have with respect to the PIPE Committed Shares (as described above).
Furthermore, we and the PIPE Investors may not amend an existing Subscription Agreement or enter into Subsequent Subscription Agreements which provide for materially different rights, benefits and obligations with respect to the PIPE Investor party thereto without first amending the Conversion Stockholder Side Letters to ensure that the rights, benefits and obligations of the former Conversion Stockholders are consistent with those of the PIPE Investors.
A Base PIPE Investor or former Conversion Stockholder will automatically forfeit any right to receive any Additional Shares if (i) at any time from the Closing through the Adjustment Period, such Base PIPE Investor or former Conversion Stockholder is not the record and beneficial owner of the PIPE Committed Shares or Conversion Stockholder Committed Shares, as applicable, or such Base PIPE Investor or former Conversion Stockholder otherwise transfers its PIPE Committed Shares or Conversion Stockholder Committed Shares, as applicable, from New Aspiration’s transfer agent’s custody to a brokerage or other account not controlled by New Aspiration’s transfer agent on behalf of such Base PIPE Investor or former Conversion Stockholder or (ii) at any time prior to the last day of the Adjustment Period, such Base PIPE Investor or former Conversion Stockholder or any person acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with such Base PIPE Investor or former Conversion Stockholder, as applicable, directly or indirectly, engages in a Hedging Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Aspiration Support Agreement
In connection with and following the execution of the Merger Agreement, we will enter into support agreements with certain Aspiration stockholders (the “Aspiration Support Agreements”), pursuant to which such Aspiration stockholders will agree, among other things, to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Business Combination and any of the documents and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Additionally, such Aspiration stockholders agreed to not transfer any securities of Aspiration held by such stockholder from the date of execution of the Aspiration Support Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to certain exceptions and to not solicit any Company Business Combination (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Aspiration Support Agreements.
Sponsor Support Agreement
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsor entered into a support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) with us and Aspiration, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed, among other things, to vote to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and all other documents and transactions contemplated thereby, to vote against any Business Combination proposal other than the Business Combination or other proposals that would impede or frustrate the Business Combination, to comply with the Merger Agreement’s prohibition on soliciting any alternative Business Combination transaction and to not transfer the equity interests in us that it owns, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sponsor Support Agreement.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
At the Closing, New Aspiration, the Sponsor and certain stockholders of New Aspiration will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the parties thereto will be granted certain customary registration rights with respect to shares of common stock of New Aspiration.
Stockholders’ Agreement
At the Closing, New Aspiration, Andrei Cherny, Joseph Sanberg and certain of their respective controlled affiliates will enter into a Stockholders’ Agreement (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”) to provide for certain governance rights and address certain governance matters relating to New Aspiration. The Stockholders’ Agreement will provide each of Mr. Cherny and Mr. Sanberg the right to nominate one individual to the New Aspiration board of directors, subject to certain qualifications, requirements and exceptions as set forth therein.
Transfer Restrictions
The Sponsor and its directors and executive officers are subject to certain restrictions on transfer with respect to their shares of New Aspiration common stock pursuant to that certain Letter Agreement, dated as of March 4, 2021, by and among us, the Sponsor, and the other parties signatory thereto. Such restrictions end on the date that is one year following the Closing, or are subject to an early price-based release with respect to 50% of such shares if the price per share of New Aspiration Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period following the Closing.
Series X Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we and Aspiration entered into a Series X Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with OCM Aspiration Holdings, LLC (“Oaktree”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Aspiration has agreed to issue and sell to Oaktree an aggregate of 27,777,777 shares of a newly designated series of preferred stock designated as Series X Preferred Stock of Aspiration, par value $0.000003 per share (the “Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000,000, which is net of the original issue discount of 10% (the “Series X Financing”), with shares of Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock having the powers, designations, preferences and other rights set forth in the Aspiration Certificate of Designations (as defined below). The closing of the issuance and sale of Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock occurred concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also provides that New Aspiration will grant Oaktree registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below).
Certificate of Designations
The shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock to be issued in exchange for shares of Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon their issuance, will have the powers, designations, preferences, and other rights as set forth in a Certificate of Designations of the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock that we will file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or prior to the Closing Date (the “New Aspiration Certificate of Designations”). The New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will have, mutatis mutandis, substantially similar powers, designations, preferences, and other rights as set forth in the Certificate of Designations of the Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock that was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Aspiration Certificate of Designations”).
Voting and Consent Rights
The New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights or rights to convert such preferred shares into shares of New Aspiration Class A common stock. Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect (i) one director to the board of directors of New Aspiration after the ninth anniversary of the Closing Date and upon a Medium Event (as defined below) and (ii) two directors to the board of directors of New Aspiration upon a Major Event (as defined below). New Aspiration will need to obtain the prior written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock for, among other things: (i) effecting any change of control, liquidation event or merger or consolidation of New Aspiration unless the entirety of the applicable Series X Redemption Price (as defined below) is paid with respect to all then issued and outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock, (ii) amending Aspiration’s organizational documents to the extent such amendment has an adverse effect on the holders of Series X Preferred Stock, (iii) increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock, (iv) creating any class or series of New Aspiration capital stock that is pari passu or senior to the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock, (v) incurring indebtedness, except for indebtedness incurred under Aspiration’s existing secured debt facilities, debt incurred that allows New Aspiration to satisfy a total net leverage ratio of 3.0x and debt incurred for the redemption of the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock (subject to limited exceptions), (vi) declaring, paying or making certain dividends and undertaking certain stock repurchases (subject to limited exceptions) and (vii) certain other specified actions.
Dividends
The dividend rate with respect to the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will be either 8.0% per year in cash or, if not paid in cash, will be paid “in-kind” by accruing at a rate of 8.0%, 11.0% or 12.0% per year for any dividend period ending on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, between the second and third anniversaries of the Closing Date or between the third and fourth anniversaries of the Closing Date, respectively. New Aspiration may elect either form of dividend payment until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, and dividends must be paid in cash thereafter.
Each of the dividend rates set forth above will increase by (i) 5.0% per annum (a) if New Aspiration fails to pay any dividend that is required to be paid in cash if surplus cash is available, (b) if New Aspiration defaults on payment with respect to a Liquidation (as defined below) or redemption, (c) if New Aspiration is in material breach of certain covenants under the New Aspiration Certificate of Designations, subject to certain cure periods, (d) if New Aspiration experiences a bankruptcy or insolvency event, whether voluntary or involuntary, (e) if New Aspiration fails to deliver New Aspiration Class A common stock to a holder of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock upon the valid exercise of the Warrant (the foregoing clauses (a) through (e), a “Major Event”), (f) if New Aspiration fails to pay any dividend that is required to be paid in cash if surplus cash is unavailable, (g) if New Aspiration is in material breach of certain other covenants under the New Aspiration Certificate of Designations, subject to certain cure periods, (h) if New Aspiration defaults on outstanding indebtedness or if outstanding indebtedness is accelerated, in each case, in excess of $50,000,000 or (i) if New Aspiration fails to pay an applicable final judgment in excess of $25,000,000 (the foregoing clauses (f) through (i), a “Medium Event,” and together with a Major Event, an “Event of Noncompliance”), or (ii) 3.0% per annum if New Aspiration is in material breach of certain other covenants under the New Aspiration Certificate of Designations that is not a Major Event or Medium Event, subject to certain cure periods (the dividend rate as increased in each of the foregoing cases, the “Noncompliance Incremental Rate”). In addition, if we do not have at least $200,000,000 of cash at the Closing (excluding proceeds from the issuance of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock), the dividend rates set forth above will increase by 5.0% per annum (exclusive of any Noncompliance Incremental Rate then in effect) and will remain in effect until, after the Closing Date, New Aspiration has $200,000,000 of cash (the dividend rate as increased by this sentence, the “de-SPAC Incremental Rate”). New Aspiration may elect to pay both the Noncompliance Incremental Rate and the de-SPAC Incremental Rate in cash or “in-kind.”
Springing Rights
Upon the occurrence of a Major Event that has continued for 90 days (and upon the occurrence of certain Major Events, and in certain circumstances, 180 days) or upon the occurrence of a Medium Event that has continued for 180 days, subject to certain time extensions, for so long as such Event of Noncompliance is continuing (the period following termination of the foregoing cure periods, the “Liquidity Period”), the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock shall have the right to cause New Aspiration to pursue an issuance of securities, a Liquidation (as defined below), merger, sale of assets or similar transaction or series of transactions, a leveraged recapitalization or any other transaction or series of transactions (each, a “Liquidity Transaction”) generating sufficient proceeds available for distribution to holders of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock to pay the entirety of the Series X Redemption Price (as defined below). During the Liquidity Period, New Aspiration shall direct an independent financial advisor, approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock then outstanding, to establish procedures to effect a Liquidity Transaction in an orderly manner with the objective of achieving the highest available value for New Aspiration within a reasonable period of time and the payment of the entire Series X Redemption Price payable in respect of all outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock. However, if a Liquidity Period has commenced and the Event of Noncompliance is cured, New Aspiration may discontinue and will not be required to pursue a Liquidity Transaction.
Immediately following the commencement of a Liquidity Transaction, holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock may take control of and direct the process of a Liquidity Transaction and cause New Aspiration to consummate, subject to any requisite stockholder approvals, any Liquidity Transaction in order to redeem the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock at the Series X Redemption Price.
Furthermore, during a Liquidity Period, unless New Aspiration is able to redeem outstanding New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock at the then applicable Series X Redemption Price as a result, New Aspiration will need to obtain the prior written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock to acquire any business, incur any indebtedness, repurchase capital stock or make distributions (subject to certain exceptions) or fail to redeem outstanding New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock with surplus cash (subject to applicable law and the terms of any indebtedness of New Aspiration).
Ranking and Liquidation Preference
The New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will rank senior to New Aspiration’s common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of New Aspiration (a “Liquidation”). Upon a Liquidation, each share of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock would be entitled to the applicable Series X Redemption Price. The liquidation preference of the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will be equal to $10 per share (the “Series X Liquidation Preference”).
Redemption Rights and Series X Redemption Price
New Aspiration will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock at any time by paying the applicable Series X Redemption Price; provided, however, that no optional redemption will be permitted that would result in less than 33% of the shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock that are issued on the Closing Date to remain outstanding following such redemption unless all remaining shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock are redeemed.
Each holder of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock will have the option to require New Aspiration to redeem any portion of the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock at the Series X Redemption Price: (i) at any time after the ninth anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) upon the occurrence of a Major Event (following the expiration of the applicable cure period) at the election of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock. New Aspiration will be required to redeem all of the outstanding shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock at the Series X Redemption Price automatically upon the occurrence of a change of control, a Liquidation or an insolvency event.
The following table sets forth the “Series X Redemption Price”:
Timing of Redemption
Series X Redemption Price
Until 30 months after the Closing Date (the “First Optional Call Date”)
Make-Whole Amount (as defined below)
From the First Optional Call Date until the first anniversary of the First Optional Call Date
106% of the sum of the Series X Liquidation Preference and accrued but unpaid dividends
From the first anniversary of the First Optional Call Date until 66 months following the First Optional Call Date
103% of the sum of the Series X Liquidation Preference and accrued but unpaid dividends
From and after the date 66 months after the First Optional Call Date
100% of the sum of the Series X Liquidation Preference and accrued but unpaid dividends
The “Make-Whole Amount” with respect to any redemption of any share of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock prior to the First Optional Call Date is defined in the New Aspiration Certificate of Designations as an amount equal to the sum of (A) the remaining dividends that would accrue on such shares being redeemed from the day immediately following the redemption date to the First Optional Call Date at 8.0% as may be increased by the de-SPAC Incremental Rate or the Noncompliance Incremental Rate, if applicable, plus (B) the Series X Liquidation Preference of such shares being redeemed plus (C) the then current amount of accrued in-kind dividends on such shares being redeemed, assuming that, for purposes of calculating the foregoing, the shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock being redeemed were to remain outstanding through the First Optional Call Date.
Series X Minimum Cash Balance
Pursuant to the New Aspiration Certificate of Designations, New Aspiration will also be required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $50,000,000 at all times so long as the New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock remains outstanding. However, if Aspiration and its subsidiaries have less than $10,000,000 in outstanding indebtedness, the required minimum cash balance is reduced to $30,000,000.
Investor Rights Agreement
We entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Oaktree to be effective upon the Closing Date (the “New Aspiration Investor Rights Agreement”) on substantially similar terms and conditions (while taking into account the consummation of the Business Combination), as those contained in the Investor Rights Agreement (as defined below) set forth below, such that New Aspiration, upon the Closing, shall be subject to the New Aspiration Investor Right Agreement.
As a condition to the closing of the Purchase Agreement, Aspiration and Oaktree entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, Aspiration granted Oaktree certain customary registration rights with respect to the shares of Aspiration common stock underlying the Warrant and certain other securities that may be issued to Oaktree in respect of the Warrant.
In addition, pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, for so long as shares of the Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock issued on the Series X Closing Date remain outstanding, Oaktree will have (i) a participation right, subject to certain exceptions, pursuant to which Oaktree may maintain its ownership percentage of Aspiration common stock in connection with future offerings or sales of Aspiration equity securities and (ii) a right of first offer with respect to the provision of any future debt or preferred equity financing to Aspiration or its subsidiaries. The Investor Rights Agreement also provides that, so long as 33% of the Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock issued on the Series X Closing Date remains outstanding, Oaktree will be entitled to appoint one non-voting observer to the board of directors of Aspiration. The Investor Rights Agreement further contains a number of other customary covenants and agreements, including certain standstill provisions, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal with respect to future debt financing transactions and information rights.
The Investor Rights Agreement provides that Oaktree will be restricted from transferring the Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock to parties unaffiliated with Oaktree without the prior written consent of Aspiration for one year following the closing of the issuance of Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock. From and after such date, Oaktree will be restricted from transferring the Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock to parties unaffiliated with Oaktree without the prior written consent of Aspiration, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld by Aspiration (other than in the event of a transfer to certain restricted transferees).
Warrant
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, at the Closing Date, New Aspiration will issue to Oaktree a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase a number of shares of New Aspiration common stock equal to 6.0% of the total number of shares of New Aspiration capital stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (excluding the shares of New Aspiration Series X Preferred Stock and the Warrant) as of immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $1,113,238, which consists of operating costs of $1,037,696, a loss on warrant liability of $128,160, interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $102,287 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $49,459.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On March 9, 2021, we consummated the Public Offering of 25,875,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,375,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $258,750,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 692,500 private placement units at a price of $10.00 per private placement unit in a private placement to the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, generating gross proceeds of $6,925,000.
Following the Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement units, a total of $258,750,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $5,787,651 in Public Offering related costs, including $5,175,000 of underwriting fees and $612,651 of other costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $254,042. Net loss of $1,113,238 was affected by a non-cash charge related to the change in warrant liability of $128,160, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $102,287 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in in the Trust Account of $(49,459) and offering costs allocable to warrant liabilities of $210. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $1,291,738 of cash for operating activities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $258,802,828 (including $102,287 of interest income and unrealized losses of $49,459 consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2021, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the Trust Account.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $1,501,391. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units.
We will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our initial stockholders, officers or directors. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through one year and one day from the issuance of this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, administrative and support services. We began incurring these fees on March 4, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and our liquidation.
We have entered into an agreement, pursuant to which we will pay our Vice President a total of $10,000 per month for assisting us in negotiating and consummating an initial business combination. Upon completion of the business combination or the Company’s liquidation, the agreement will terminate and the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.
We have engaged Morgan Stanley and EarlyBirdCapital as advisors in connection with the business combination to assist us in holding meetings with our stockholders to discuss the potential business combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with the business combination, assist us in obtaining stockholder approval for the business combination and assist us with its press releases and public filings in connection with the business combination. We will pay Morgan Stanley and EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a business combination in an amount equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable).
We have issued to EarlyBirdCapital, and/or its designees, 200,000 representative shares (the “representative shares”) for nominal consideration. The holders of the representative shares have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares without our prior consent until the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, the holders of the representative shares have agreed (i) to waive their conversion rights (or right to participate in any tender offer) with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering.
The representative shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-1 pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of the FINRA Manual. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1), these securities will not be sold during the offering, or sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the Registration Statement on Form S-1 or commencement of sales of the public offering, except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the offering and their bona fide officers or partners, provided that all securities so transferred remain subject to the lockup restriction above for the remainder of the time period.
We have granted the holders of these shares and the private placement units registration rights. EarlyBirdCapital may not exercise its demand and “piggy-back” registration rights more than five and seven years, respectively, after the effective date of our Registration Statement on Form S-1 and may not exercise its demand rights on more than one occasion in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8).
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Warrant Classification
We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own shares of common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. As of December 31, 2021 and March 9, 2021, the private placement warrants were accounted for as liabilities, and the public warrants were accounted for as temporary equity.
Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, the entire amount of the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements.
