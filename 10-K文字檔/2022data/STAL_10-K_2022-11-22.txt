Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our cash balance was $71,724 as of June 30, 2022. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing funds raised from the sale of shares and borrowed from our Chairman. The Chairman has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. The borrowing is non-interest-bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.
Our independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company continues as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $15,058,400 and working capital of $1,034,930 as of June 30, 2022, and a net loss of $11,885,609 most of which is a non cash expense. The Company used $739,630 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
Results of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021
Operating expenses
General and administrative expenses were $1,909,581 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to $94,508 for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $1,815,073. The increase is due to an increase in filing fees and consulting expenses.
Professional fees were $144,763 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to $57,029 for the year ended June 30, 2021, increase of $87,734. Professional fees consist mainly of legal, accounting and audit expense. The increase is due to an increase in legal and audit fees.
There was a loss on conversion of common stock for Directors compensation of $2,111,500 and officer compensation of $952,500 for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $90,000 and $155,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021
Other income (expense)
For the year ended June 30, 2022, we had interest expense of $297,417 and a net loss on conversion of debt of $102,403 compared to interest expense of $10,800 and loss on conversion of debt of $46,200 for the year ended June 30, 2021. In addition, there was a loss on issuance of convertible debt of $575,396 compared to $0 in 2021. . Interest expense has increased as a result of interest on notes payable that were added to the Company’s liabilities and the amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible notes.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $11,885,609 compared to $503,017 for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Plan of Operations
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through borrowing from related parties and others. Subsequent to the year end the Company acquired the mining claims and equipment assets of Troy Mining Corporation. We also acquired or entered into binding letters of intent to acquire other businesses during the year ended June 30, 2022.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Material Commitments
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.
Purchase of Significant Equipment
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $15,058,400 and working capital of $1,034,930 as of June 30, 2022, and a net loss of $11,885,609 most of which is non cash expense. The Company used $739,630 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Net cash used in operating activities was $739,630 for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the net cash used in operating activities of $355,574 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in net cash used in operating activities from 2022 to 2021 is because expenses increased during the year ended June 30, 2022.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,004,565 and $342,305 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Over the next twelve months, we expect our principle source of liquidity may be dependent on borrowings from related and other parties.
Going Concern Consideration
Our auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. The Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
Limited operating history and need for additional capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any significant revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
