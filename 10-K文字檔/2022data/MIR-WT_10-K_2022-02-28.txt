ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of Mirion’s financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Mirion Technologies, Inc. that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section entitled “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please also see the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Mirion” and “the Company” refer to the business and operations of Mirion Technologies TopCo, Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination and to Mirion and its consolidated subsidiaries, following the consummation of the Business Combination. Unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts in this section are in millions.
Overview
We are a global provider of products, services, and software that allow our customers to safely leverage the power of ionizing radiation for the greater good of humanity through critical applications in the medical, nuclear and defense markets, as well as laboratories, scientific research, analysis, and exploration.
We provide dosimetry solutions for monitoring the total amount of radiation medical staff members are exposed to over time, radiation therapy quality assurance solutions for calibrating and verifying imaging and treatment accuracy, and radionuclide therapy products for nuclear medicine applications such as shielding, product handling, medical imaging furniture, and rehabilitation products. We provide robust, field-ready personal radiation detection and identification equipment for defense applications and radiation detection and analysis tools for power plants, labs, and research applications. Nuclear power plant product offerings are used for the full nuclear power plant lifecycle including core detectors, essential measurement devices for new build, maintenance, decontamination and decommission, and equipment for monitoring and control during fuel dismantling and remote environmental monitoring.
We manage and report results of operations in two business segments: Medical and Industrial.
•Our revenues were $154.1 million for the Successor Period and $168.0 million for the Predecessor Stub Period, of which 31.9% and 35.9% was generated in the Medical segment for the Successor and Predecessor Stub Periods, respectively, and 68.1% and 64.1% was generated in the Industrial segment for the Successor and Predecessor Periods, respectively. Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2020 were $265.4 million, with 19.6% and 80.4% generated in the Medical and Industrial segments, respectively.
•Backlog (representing committed but undelivered contracts and purchase orders, including funded and unfunded government contracts) was $747.5 million and $715.8 million as of December 31, 2021, and June 30, 2021, respectively.
The Mirion Business Combination
The Business Combination closed on October 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), and GSAH was renamed Mirion Technologies, Inc. Our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MIR.”
The Business Combination is being accounted for under ASC 805, Business Combinations. GSAH has been determined to be the accounting acquirer. Mirion constitutes a business in accordance with ASC 805 and the Business Combination constitutes a change in control. Accordingly, the Business Combination is being accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method of accounting, Mirion is treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes and our net assets are stated at fair value, with goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
On October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors determined to change Mirion TopCo's fiscal year end from June 30 of each year to December 31 of each year. The determination was made to align Mirion’s fiscal year end with GSAH’s fiscal year end. See the "Basis of Presentation" section below for further details regarding the impact of the Business Combination and the change in fiscal year-end on the presentation of our financial statements.
As a result of the Business Combination, Mirion’s financial statement presentation distinguishes Mirion TopCo as the “Predecessor” for periods prior to the closing of the Business Combination and Mirion Technologies, Inc. as the “Successor” for periods after the closing of the Business Combination. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the Successor Period, the financial statements for the Successor Period are presented on a full
step-up basis as a result of the Business Combination, and are therefore not comparable to the financial statements of the Predecessor Period that are not presented on the same full step-up basis due to the Business Combination.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
We believe that our business and results of operations and financial condition may be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:
•Global risk-Our business depends in part on operations and sales outside the United States. Risks related to those international operations and sales include new foreign investment laws, new export/import regulations, and additional trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes). New laws that favor local competitors could prevent our ability to compete outside the United States. Additional potential issues are associated with the impact of these same risks on our suppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are impacted by these risk factors, we may see the reduction or cancellation of customer orders, or interruptions in raw materials and components.
•Tariffs or Sanctions-The United States imposes tariffs on imports from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs and restrictions implemented by China and other countries. There are, at any given time, a multitude of ongoing or threatened armed conflicts around the world. As one example, United States and other countries sanctions against Russian entities or individuals related to developments in Ukraine, along with any Russian retaliatory measures could increase our costs, adversely affect our operations, or impact our ability to meet existing contractual obligations.
•Medical end market trends-Growth and operating results in our Medical segment are impacted by:
•Increased or changes to global regulatory standards;
•Increased focus on healthcare safety;
•Changes to healthcare reimbursement;
•Potential budget constraints in hospitals and other healthcare providers;
•Medical/lab dosimetry growth supported by growing and aging demographics, increased number of healthcare professionals, and penetration of radiation therapy/diagnostics; and
•Medical radiation therapy quality assurance (“RT QA”) growth driven by growing and aging population demographics, low penetration of RT QA technology in emerging markets, and increased adoption of advanced software and hardware solutions for improved outcomes and administrative and labor efficiencies.
•Business combinations-A large driver of our historical growth has been the acquisition and integration of related businesses. Our ability to integrate, restructure, and leverage synergies of these businesses will impact our operating results over time.
•Environmental objectives of governments-Growth and operating results in our Industrial segment are impacted by environmental policy decisions made by governments in the countries where we operate. Our nuclear power customers may benefit from decarbonization efforts given the relatively low carbon footprint of nuclear power to other existing energy sources. In addition, decisions by governments to build new power plants or decommission existing plants can positively and negatively impact our customer base.
•Government budgets-While we believe that we are poised for growth from governmental customers in both of our segments, our revenues and cash flows from government customers are influenced, particularly in the short-term, by budgetary cycles. This impact can be either positive or negative.
•Nuclear new build projects-A portion of our backlog is driven by contracts associated with the construction of new nuclear power plants. These contracts can be long-term in nature and provide us with a strong pipeline for the recognition of future revenues in our Industrial segment. We perform our services and provide our products at a fixed price for certain contracts. Fixed-price contracts carry inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, operational difficulties and other changes that may occur over the contract period. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, we may incur losses or the contract may not be as profitable as we expected. In addition, even though some of our longer-term contracts contain price escalation provisions, such provisions may not fully provide for cost increases, whether from inflation, the cost of goods and services to be delivered under such contracts or otherwise.
•Research and developments-A portion of our operating expenses is associated with research and development activities associated with the design of new products. Given the specific design and application of certain of these products, there is some risk that these costs will not result in successful products in the market. Further, the timing of these products can move and be challenging to predict.
•COVID-19-COVID-19 may affect revenue growth in certain of our businesses, primarily those serving our medical end markets, and it is uncertain how materially COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts were to persist or worsen over an extended period of time. The extent and duration of the impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity ramping up. The impact of COVID-19 on our customers has affected our sales operations in certain ways, including increased customer disputes regarding orders, delayed customer notices to proceed with production, delayed payment from customers and, on rare occasions, customers have refused to pay for their orders entirely. Further, access to customer sites for sales was limited in some cases.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. (“GAAP”). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and other users with additional meaningful information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, and planning decisions, and in evaluating our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
We use the non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted revenues,” “Adjusted net (loss) income,” "Adjusted EPS," “EBITDA,” “EBITA,” “Adjusted EBITDA, “Free Cash Flow,” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow.” See the “Quarterly Results of Operations” and “Cash flows” sections below for definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.
See the "Basis of Presentation" section below regarding the Successor and Predecessor periods. The following tables present a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures for the Successor Period from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and the Predecessor Periods from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021, and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2019.
(1)Pre-tax non-operating expenses of $7.0 million for the Successor Period from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 includes $1.9 million in costs to achieve integration and operational synergies, $2.2 million related to the Business Combination and costs to prepare for becoming a public company, $1.4 million of restructuring costs, and $1.0 million of costs to achieve information technology system integration and efficiency.
(2)Pre-tax non-operating expenses of $34.7 million for the Predecessor Stub Period from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021 includes $26.2 million related to the Business Combination and costs to prepare for becoming a public company, $4.1 million in costs to achieve integration and operational synergies, $1.5 million of restructuring costs, and $1.5 million of costs to achieve information technology system integration and efficiency.
(3)Pre-tax non-operating expenses of $43.1 million for the Predecessor Period fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 includes $14.2 million of legal and professional fees related to the Business Combination and costs to prepare for becoming a public company, $13.1 million in costs to achieve integration and operational synergies, $5.9 million of mergers and acquisition expenses, $5.5 million of restructuring costs, and $4.5 million of costs to achieve information technology system integration and efficiency.
(4)Pre-tax non-operating expenses of $20.1 million for the Predecessor Period fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 includes $10.8 million of mergers and acquisition expenses, $3.8 million of costs to achieve operational synergies, $3.4 million of costs to achieve information technology system integration and efficiency, and $1.6 million of expenses related to debt refinancing.
(5)Pre-tax non-operating expenses of $14.7 million for the Predecessor Period fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 includes $6.5 million of mergers and acquisition expenses, $2.8 million of costs to achieve information technology system integration and efficiency, $2.8 million of costs to achieve operational synergies, and $0.5 million of expenses related to debt refinancing.
The following tables present a reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the Successor and Predecessor Stub Period:

Recent Developments
Credit Agreement
On October 20, 2021, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) among Mirion Technologies (HoldingSub2), Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales, as Holdings, Mirion Technologies (US Holdings), Inc., as the Parent Borrower, Mirion Technologies (US), Inc., as the Subsidiary Borrower, the lending institutions party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies Finance LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Joint Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for an $830.0 million senior secured first lien term loan facility and a $90.0 million senior secured revolving facility (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”). For more information, see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt Profile.” The 2021 Credit Agreement refinanced and replaced that certain credit agreement from March 2019, by and between, among others, Mirion Technologies (HoldingRep), Ltd., its subsidiaries and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., as administrative agent, certain other revolving lenders and a syndicate of institutional lenders (the “2019 Credit Facility”). The 2021 Credit Agreement was amended by Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement on November 22, 2021 which permitted Holdings, Parent Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) to change their fiscal year from June 30 to December 31.
Profits Interests
In conjunction with the Business Combination Agreement, on June 17, 2021 the Sponsor issued membership interests to certain Mirion employees and the Chairman of the Board of Mirion (collectively, the "Profits Interests"). The Profits Interests are subject to service and performance vesting conditions and do not fully vest until all of the applicable conditions are satisfied. In addition, the Profits Interests are subject to certain forfeiture conditions. Accordingly, these awards have been treated as stock-based compensation under ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value of the profits interests is based upon a valuation model using Monte Carlo simulations. As the Profits Interests included the completion of the Business Combination as a vesting condition, the expense that accumulated prior to the Business Combination was recorded on the last day of the Predecessor Stub Period and the remainder is recorded over the future vesting period.
CIRS Acquisition
On December 1, 2021, the Company purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc. (“CIRS”) for an aggregate of $54 million, net of cash acquired of $1.0 million. CIRS is a leading provider of medical imaging and radiation therapy phantoms serving the medical industry located in the United States. The acquisition is included in our Medical segment and will advance the Company’s strategy to further expand into the medical treatment markets globally.
Other Acquisitions
During the periods presented we completed three acquisitions of U.S.-based providers of dosimetry services which we believe will increase the U.S. footprint of Mirion's industry-leading dosimetry product offering. On December 1, 2021 we acquired Safeline Monitors Systems LLC, for $1.5 million plus contingent consideration of $0.5 million. On November 1, 2021, we acquired CHP Dosimetry, for $2.5 million. On September 1, 2021 we acquired Dosimetry Badge for $1.8 million plus contingent consideration of $0.8 million.
SNC Acquisition
On December 18, 2020, we purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sun Nuclear Corporation (“SNC”) for an aggregate of $258.1 million, net of cash acquired of $18.8 million. SNC is a global leader in radiation therapy quality assurance, delivering patient safety solutions for diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy providers in multiple countries around the world. The acquisition is included in our Medical segment and will advance the Company’s strategy to further expand into the radiation therapy markets globally.
Biodex Acquisition
On September 1, 2020, the Company purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Biodex Medical Systems, Inc. (“Biodex”) for an aggregate of $26.9 million, net of cash acquired of $4.1 million. Biodex is a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices and related replacement parts for physical and nuclear medicine, as well as medical imaging applications located in the United States. The acquisition is included in our Medical segment and will advance the Company’s strategy to further expand into the medical treatment markets globally.
Public Company Costs
We expect to continue as an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company. We expect to hire additional staff and implement new processes and procedures to address public company requirements. We have incurred substantial additional expenses for, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, and additional internal and external costs for investor relations, accounting, audit, legal and other functions.
Basis of Presentation
Financial information presented was derived from our historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records, and they reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the business in conformity with U.S. GAAP for financial statements and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. For consolidated subsidiaries where our ownership is less than 100%, the portion of the net income or loss allocable to noncontrolling interests is reported as “Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the consolidated statements of operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. See the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
As a result of the Business Combination, the Company’s financial statement presentation distinguishes Mirion TopCo as the “Predecessor” through the Closing Date. The Company, which includes the combination of GSAH and Mirion subsequent to the Business Combination, is the “Successor” for periods after the Closing Date. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the Successor Period, the financial statements for the Successor Period are presented on a full step-up basis as a result of the Business Combination, and are therefore not comparable to the financial statements of the Predecessor Periods that are not presented on the same full step-up basis due to the Business Combination.
Certain Factors Affecting Comparability to Prior Period Financial Results
Prior to the Business Combination, GSAH operated as a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets. As a result, operations were minimal before the Business Combination and are not presented in the Predecessor Periods presented prior to the Business Combination. After the Business Combination our results of operations are not directly comparable to historical results of the operations for the periods presented, primarily because:
•Mirion TopCo's fiscal year-end was changed from June 30 to December 31 to align with GSAH's fiscal year end. As a result of this change, the consolidated financial statements presented include the Predecessor Stub Period from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021, and the Successor Period from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
•In connection with the Business Combination, certain assets and liabilities had fair value adjustments applied to the Predecessor’s consolidated financial statements on the Closing Date, most notably:
◦Inventory;
◦Property, plant, and equipment;
◦Goodwill;
◦Intangible assets; and
◦Taxes.
•The Successor Period ended December 31, 2021 only includes Mirion's operating activity since the consummation of the Business Combination on October 20, 2021.
As a result of the factors listed above, historical results of operations and other financial data, as well as period-to-period comparisons of these results, may not be comparable or indicative of future operating results or future financial condition.
Results of Operations
The following tables set forth the Company’s results of operations for the Successor Period and the Predecessor Stub Period compared to the unaudited 4six months ended December 31, 2020 (in millions).
Periods from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (Successor) and July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021 (Predecessor Stub Period) Compared to unaudited Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Overview
Revenues were $154.1 million for the Successor Period from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and $168.0 million for the Predecessor Stub Period from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021. The increase of $56.7 million from the six months ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by acquisitions in the Medical segment and organic growth in the Medical segment. Cost of revenues was $100.2 million for the Successor Period and $97.7 million in the Predecessor Stub Period which increased 27.0% compared to the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the increase in revenues. Gross profit increased by $14.6 million from the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. There was a net loss attributable to stockholders of $22.2 million for the Successor Period and $105.7 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Net loss for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020 was $59.7 million. There was a $68.2 million increase in net loss as a result of the increase in gross profit, more than offset by higher SG&A expenses of $87.7 million, primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions in the Medical segment, increased non-operational legal and professional fees incurred to prepare for being a public company, and stock-based compensation expense. Offsetting the increase in net loss period over period was decreased net interest expense of $17.4 million, the positive impact of foreign currency exchange of $15.3 million, a gain recognized on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1.2 million, offset by a net increase in income tax benefit of $5.0 million and a net increase in other expense (income), net of $2.3 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue for the SNC acquisition reduced revenue for the Successor and Predecessor Stub Periods by $6.8 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory increased cost of revenues by $15.8 million for the Successor Period and $0.5 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair values of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment for the Business Combination resulted in increased amortization and depreciation expense and increased net loss by $18.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
Revenues
Revenues were $154.1 million for the Successor Period and $168.0 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Revenues increased $56.7 million from the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. The majority of the increase was a result of the acquisitions in the Medical segment contributing $61.3 million (of which $53.9 million was generated by SNC, $5.1 million by Biodex, $1.5 million by CIRS, and $0.8 million by other acquisitions) and a $3.2 million increase due to organic growth. Industrial segment revenues decreased $0.7 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $2.5 million offset by a $1.8 million increase due to organic growth. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue for the SNC acquisition reduced Medical segment revenues for the Successor and Predecessor Stub Periods by $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
By segment, revenues for the Successor and Predecessor Period were $49.2 million and $60.3 million in the Medical segment, respectively, and $104.9 million and $107.7 million in the Industrial segment for the Successor and Predecessor Periods, respectively. Movements in revenues by segment are detailed in the “Business Segments” section below.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues was $100.2 million for the Successor Period and $97.7 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Cost of Revenues for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020 were $155.8 million. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 65.0% for the Successor Period, 58.2% for the Predecessor Stub Period, and 58.7% for the six months ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the Successor Period was driven by purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory from the Business Combination. In addition, cost of revenues increased over the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020 due to acquisitions in our Medical segment ($25.9 million combined from SNC, Biodex, CIRS, and other acquisitions) and an increase in our Industrial segment cost of revenues of $0.7 million offset by a decrease due to the impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $1.9 million. Cost of revenues for the Successor Period includes $15.8 million due to purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory from the Business Combination, $0.9 million of increased amortization expense resulting from increased intangible assets from the Business Combination, and $1.1 million of increased depreciation expense resulting from increased fair values of property, plant, and equipment from the Business Combination. Cost of revenues for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020 includes $0.5 million due to purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory from previous acquisitions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $70.1 million for the Successor Period and $101.6 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. SG&A expenses were $84.0 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an increase of $87.7 million. The primary drivers behind the increase in SG&A expenses were the impact of acquisitions in the Medical segment ($20.8 million combined from SNC, Biodex, and CIRS), a $28.4 million increase related to the Business Combination and costs to prepare for becoming a public company, and a $14.6 million increase in stock based compensation expense related to the Profits Interests (see Note 14, Stock-based compensation). SG&A for the Successor Period includes $17.8 million of increased amortization expense resulting from increased intangible assets from the Business Combination and $0.2 million of increased depreciation expense resulting from increased fair values of property, plant, and equipment from the Business Combination.
Research and development
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $6.7 million for the Successor Period and $10.3 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. R&D expenses were $10.3 million for the unaudited six months ended December 3, 2020, resulting in an increase of $6.7 million. The increase in R&D expense was primarily a result of the prior period acquisitions in our Medical segment ($9.7 million combined from SNC, Biodex, and CIRS), partially offset by a decrease in R&D activity expensed in our Industrial segment of $2.2 million.
Income (loss) from operations
Loss from operations was $22.9 million for the Successor Period and $41.6 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Income from operation was $15.3 million during the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in an increased loss of $79.8 million. On a segment basis, income (loss) from operations in the Medical segment for the Successor Period and Predecessor Stub Period was $(4.3) million and $0.7 million, respectively, which includes $16.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in purchase accounting impacts described in revenues, cost of revenues, and SG&A above. Income from operations in the Industrial segment for the Successor Period and Predecessor Stub Period was $1.1 million and $11.7 million, respectively, which includes $21.4 million in purchase accounting impacts described in cost of
revenues and SG&A above in the Successor Period. Corporate expenses were $19.7 million and $54.0 million for the Successor Period and Predecessor Stub Period, respectively. See “Business segments” and “Corporate and other” below for further details.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net, was $6.2 million for the Successor Period and $52.8 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Interest expense, net, was $76.4 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. The $17.4 million change is a non-cash decrease in interest related to the Shareholder Notes which were paid in full in connection with the closing of the Business Combination. See Note 8, Borrowings, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Loss on debt extinguishment
Loss on debt extinguishment in the Predecessor Stub Period of $15.9 million is the result of the write-off of previously deferred financing costs related to the 2019 Credit Facility that was extinguished in connection with the Business Combination. See Note 8, Borrowings, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign currency (gain) loss, net
The Company recorded a loss of $1.6 million for the Successor Period and a gain of $0.6 million for the Predecessor Stub Period from foreign currency exchange. The Company recorded a loss of $16.3 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020, from foreign currency exchange. The change in net foreign currency losses is due to appreciation in European and Canadian local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar and primarily related to our Euro debt in the prior year comparable period.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities
The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $1.2 million resulting from an increase in the fair value of the Public Warrant and Private Placement Warrant liabilities during the Successor Period. See Note 17, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Income taxes
Income tax benefit was $6.8 million for the Successor Period and $5.6 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Income tax benefit was $17.4 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. Income tax benefit in the Successor Period differed from income tax benefit in the Predecessor Stub Period and the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in valuation allowances.
Business segments
The following provides detail for business segment results for the Successor Period, the Predecessor Stub Period, and the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. Segment income from operations includes revenues of the segment less expenses that are directly related to those revenues but excludes certain charges to cost of revenues and SG&A expenses predominantly related to corporate costs, shared overhead and other costs related to restructuring activities and costs to achieve operational initiatives, which are included in Corporate and Other in the table below. Interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, foreign currency loss (gain), net, and other expense (income), net, are not allocated to segments.
For reconciliations of segment revenues and operating income to our consolidated results, see Note 16, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Medical
Medical segment revenues were $49.2 million for the Successor Period and $60.3 million for the Predecessor Stub Period, which is an increase of $57.4 million from Medical segment revenues of $52.1 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. Revenues increased primarily due to the impact of acquisitions contributing $61.3 million (of which $53.9 million was generated by SNC, $5.1 million by Biodex, $1.5 million by CIRS, and $0.8 million by other acquisitions) and an increase of $3.2 million in our legacy business due to organic growth. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted Medical revenues by approximately $0.3 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue for the SNC acquisition reduced Medical segment revenues for the Successor and Predecessor Stub Periods by $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
Loss from operations, which excludes non-operational costs, was $4.3 million for the Successor Period and income from operations was $0.7 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Income from operations, which excludes non-operational costs, was $8.7 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease in income from operations of $12.3 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately 20.0% largely due to the lower margins and higher operating expenses of acquisitions, driven in large part by amortization expense (reducing margins by $1.6 million and increasing operating expenses by $5.8 million). Additionally, income from operations as a percentage of revenues was impacted in the Successor Period by a $2.3 million reduction in revenue resulting from purchase accounting related to the SNC acquisition; increases in cost of revenues resulting from the purchase accounting impacts on inventory, amortization, and depreciation in connection with the Business Combination of $3.2 million, $2.0 million, and $0.8 million, respectively; and increases in SG&A expenses resulting from the purchase accounting impacts on amortization and depreciation in connection with the Business Combination of $8.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues was impacted in the Predecessor Stub Period by a $4.5 million reduction in revenue resulting from purchase accounting related to the SNC acquisition, and in the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020 by a $0.5 million due to purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory from previous acquisitions.
Industrial
Industrial segment revenues were $104.9 million for the Successor Period and $107.7 million for the Predecessor Stub Period, which was a slight decrease of $0.7 million from revenues of $213.3 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. The slight decrease is primarily driven by foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $2.5 million offset by a $1.8 million increase due to organic growth.
Income from operations, which excludes non-operational costs, was $1.1 million for the Successor Period and $11.7 million for the Predecessor Stub Period. Income from operations, which excludes non-operational costs, was $33.8 million for the period ending December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of $21.0 million driven primarily by higher cost of revenues including $12.6 million of inventory step-up and higher amortization of $8.4 million, both related to the Business Combination purchase accounting.
Corporate and other
Corporate and other costs include costs associated with our corporate headquarters located in Georgia, as well as centralized global functions including Executive, Finance, Legal and Compliance, Human Resources, Technology, Strategy, and Marketing and other costs related to company-wide initiatives (e.g., Business Combination transaction expenses, merger and acquisition activities, restructuring and other initiatives).
Corporate and other costs were $19.7 million for the Successor period and $54.0 million for the Predecessor Stub Period which is an increase of $46.7 million when compared to the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. The increase versus the comparable period was predominantly driven by $28.4 million of fees related to the Business Combination and costs to prepare for becoming a public company, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $14.6 million related to the Profits Interests (see Note 14, Stock based compensation), $2.0 million increase in other costs related to company-wide initiatives ($4.2 million in operations and information technology integrations, $1.6 million in restructuring costs, partially offset by $3.6 million in lower merger and acquisition costs), an increase of $1.8 million in compensation expense, $0.9 million increase in facility costs and $0.9 million increase in corporate insurance mostly due to becoming a public company. For reconciliations of segment operating income and corporate and other costs to our consolidated results, see Note 16, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Year ended June 30, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to year ended June 30, 2020 (Predecessor)
Overview
Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 (“FY 2021” or “fiscal 2021”) were $611.6 million, resulting in an increase of $133.4 million, or 27.9%, from the same period in the prior year primarily driven by acquisitions in the Medical segment and organic growth in the Industrial segment. Cost of revenues of $359.8 million also increased 28.0% compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting the increase in revenues, a $3.1 million increase in restructuring costs, and a $3.4 million increase in costs to achieve operational synergies. Gross profit increased by $54.8 million and as a percentage of revenue was consistent period over period for the Company, including a decrease in percentage of revenue in our Medical segment of 8.5%, offset by an increase in percentage of revenue in our Industrial segment of 1.4%. There was a net loss of $158.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a net loss of $119.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2020. The $39.3 million, or 33.0%, increase is the result of the increase in gross profit, offset by higher SG&A expenses of $53.1 million, primarily driven by acquisitions in the Medical segment and a $17.6 million increase in non-operational legal and professional fees incurred to prepare for being a public company and costs related to restructuring, mergers and acquisitions and costs to achieve synergies. Also contributing to the increase in net loss period over period was increased net interest expense of $14.0 million and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $14.0 million offset by a net increase in income tax benefit of $0.4 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value adjustment of
deferred revenue reduced revenue in the year ended June 30, 2021 by $8.0 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory increased cost of revenues by $5.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Revenues
Revenues were $611.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $133.4 million, or 27.9%, compared with $478.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The majority of the increase was a result of the acquisitions in the Medical segment contributing $91.7 million (of which $48.9 million was generated by SNC, $32.6 million by Biodex, $9.2 million from AWST and $1.0 million from Dosimetrics). The Industrial segment revenues also increased $39.7 million of which $11.4 million was driven by Reactor Safety and Control Systems products and $28.3 million was driven by Radiological Search, Measurement, and Analysis Systems products resulting from increased product orders and release of new products and the positive impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $18.4 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue reduced revenue in the year ended June 30, 2021 by $8.0 million.
By segment, revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $155.7 million in the Medical segment and $455.9 million in the Industrial segment. Movements in revenues by segment are detailed in the Business Segments section below.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues was $359.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $78.6 million, or 28.0% compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was flat year over year. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to acquisitions in our Medical segment ($53.6 million combined from SNC, Biodex, AWST, and Dosimetrics), an increase in our Industrial segment cost of revenues of $17.5 million related to the increase in revenues, including the impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $10.9 million, and $6.5 million of restructuring costs and costs to achieve operational synergies. Cost of revenues includes a $5.2 million increase from purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $211.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $53.1 million, or 33.6%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 34.5% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, a 1.5 percentage point increase compared with 33.1% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. The primary drivers behind the increase in SG&A expenses were the impact of acquisitions in the Medical Segment ($34.5 million combined from SNC, Biodex, AWST and Dosimetrics), $17.6 million increase in non-operational legal and professional fees incurred to prepare for being a public company and costs related to restructuring, mergers and acquisitions and costs to achieve synergies, $6.4 million increase in compensation-related expenses and the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $5.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of $3.7 million and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses of $3.7 million.
Research and development
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $29.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $13.5 million, or 84.9%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to business combinations ($10.4 million combined from SNC, Biodex, AWST, and Dosimetrics), increased R&D activity of $2.5 million to develop new products in the Industrial segment and the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $0.6 million.
Income from operations
Income from operations for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $11.2 million, a decrease of $11.8 million, or 51.3%, when compared to income from operations of $23.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. On a segment basis, income from operations was $6.0 million in the Medical segment, which includes $13.2 million in purchase accounting impacts described in revenues and cost of revenues above, and $81.5 million in Industrial segment. Corporate expenses were $76.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. See “Business segments” and “Corporate and other” below for further details.
Interest expense
Interest expense, net, was $163.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $149.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The $14.0 million, or 9.4%, change is a non-cash increase in interest related to the Stockholder Notes which are described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency (gain) loss, net
The Company recorded a loss of $13.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, from foreign currency exchange. The change in net foreign currency losses is due to appreciation in European and Canadian local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
Income taxes
Income tax benefit was $5.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 versus a benefit of $5.5 million in for the year ended June 30, 2020. The $0.4 million change is primarily due to the mix of earnings and jurisdictions during each respective period.
Business segments
The following provides detail for business segment results for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. Segment income from operations includes revenues of the segment less expenses that are directly related to those revenues but excludes certain charges to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses predominantly related to corporate costs, shared overhead and other costs related to restructuring activities and costs to achieve operational initiatives, which are included in Corporate and Other in the table below. Interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, foreign currency loss (gain), net, and other expense (income), net, are not allocated to segments. For reconciliations of segment revenues and operating income to our consolidated results, see Note 16, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Medical
Medical segment revenues were $155.7 million, for the year ended June 30, 2021, which is an increase of $93.1 million, or 148.7%, from the year ended June 30, 2020. Revenues increased primarily due to the impact of acquisitions contributing $91.7 million (of which $48.9 million was generated by SNC, $32.6 million by Biodex, $9.2 million from AWST and $1.0 million from Dosimetrics) and an increase of $1.2 million in our legacy business. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted Medical revenues by approximately $0.2 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue reduced revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 by $8.0 million.
Income from operations, which excludes non-operational costs, for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $7.9 million compared with the year ended June 30, 2020. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately 18.3% primarily due to the lower margins and higher operating expenses of the acquisitions in the year ended June 30, 2021, driven in large part by amortization expense (reducing margins by $3.3 million and increasing operating expenses by $12.3 million). Bad debt expense in our legacy business also increased (partially driven by COVID 19) by $1.3 million. Additionally, income from operations as a percentage of revenues was impacted by the $8.0 million reduction in revenue and $5.2 million increase in cost of revenues resulting from purchase accounting.
Industrial
Industrial segment revenues were $455.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $40.3 million, or 9.7% from the year ended June 30, 2020. Revenues increased in both product and service revenues, primarily due to new product offerings in the Radiological Search, Measurement and Analysis Systems product group such as the MBD-2 dosimeter and Aegis spectrometer. Foreign currency positively impacted revenues by approximately $18.4 million. Additionally, revenues increased due to the impact of the acquisition of Selmic in fiscal 2020, which contributed approximately $3.6 million of additional revenue in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020.
Income from operations, which excludes non-operational costs, was $81.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $21.9 million compared with the year ended June 30, 2020 driven primarily by higher revenues. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased 3.6% primarily due to operating expense savings driven primarily by COVID-19 restrictions on employee travel and fixed overhead absorption.
Corporate and other
Corporate and other costs include costs associated with our headquarters located in Georgia, as well as centralized global functions including Executive, Finance, Legal and Compliance, Human Resources, Technology, Strategy, and Marketing and other costs related to company-wide initiatives (e.g., merger and acquisition activities, restructuring and other initiatives). Corporate and other costs were $76.3 million and $50.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The $25.8 million increase in corporate and other expenses during the year ended June 30, 2021 versus the comparable period was predominantly driven by $14.2 million of legal and professional fees related to the Business Combination and costs to prepare for becoming a public company, an increase in compensation and related costs of $4.2 million, restructuring costs of $5.5 million, an increase in mergers and acquisition, integration and operational efficiency costs of $4.0 million, an increase in professional fees of $2.4 million, and an increase in costs to achieve information technology system integration and efficiency of $1.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in debt issuance costs of $1.6 million, a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses of $1.1 million, and a decrease in facilities costs of $1.0 million. For reconciliations of segment operating income and corporate and other costs to our consolidated results, see Note 16-Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Year ended June 30, 2020 (Predecessor) compared to year ended June 30, 2019 (Predecessor)
Overview
Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2020 (“FY 2020” or “fiscal 2020”) were $478.2 million, an increase of 8.7% from the year ended June 30, 2019 (“FY 2019” or “fiscal 2019”) primarily driven by acquisitions in FY 2020 in both the Medical and Industrial segment. Cost of revenues increased $29.3 million, or 11.6% primarily reflecting the increase in revenues. Gross profit increased by $8.8 million and as a percentage of revenue for the Company was consistent period over period. There was a net loss of $119.1 million in FY 2020 compared to net loss of $122.0 million in FY 2019. The 2.4% decrease in net loss in FY 2020 is primarily the result of an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase in SG&A of $12.7 million, including $7.6 million of acquisition costs and costs to achieve operational synergies, decreased loss on debt extinguishment of $12.8 million and increase in other income of $2.9 million, increase in interest expense of $5.7 million, and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $2.6 million. The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory increased our cost of revenues by $1.6 million for FY 2020.
Revenues
Revenues were $478.2 million for FY 2020, an increase of $38.1 million, or 8.7%, compared with $440.1 million for FY 2019. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the impact of FY 2020 acquisitions in both the Medical and Industrial segments ($31.7 million combined from Capintec, Selmic, Premium Analyse, and AWST) and higher volumes in legacy operations.
By segment, revenues were $62.6 million in the Medical segment and $415.6 million in the Industrial segment. Movements in revenues by segment are discussed in greater detail in the “Business segment” discussion below.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues was $281.2 million in FY 2020, an increase of $29.3 million, or 11.6% compared to FY 2019. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 58.8% for FY 2020, a 1.6% increase compared with 57.2% for FY 2019. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the impact of business combinations ($22.9 million combined from Capintec, Selmic, Premium Analyse, and AWST) and unfavorable product sales mix (i.e., higher sales of products with lower margin versus products with higher margin during the period). The impact of purchase accounting related to the fair value of inventory increased our cost of revenues by $1.6 million in FY 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
SG&A expenses were $158.1 million in FY 2020, an increase of $12.7 million, or 8.7%, compared to FY 2019. SG&A expenses as a percent of revenues was 33.1% in FY 2020, compared to 33.0% in FY 2019. The primary drivers behind the
increase in SG&A expenses were expenses associated with business combinations ($7.1 million combined from Capintec, Selmic, Premium Analyse, and AWST), an increase of $7.6 million in costs to achieve operational synergies and mergers and acquisitions, increase in professional fees of $2.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $4.3 million.
Research and development
R&D expenses were $15.9 million in FY 2020, an increase of $1.9 million, or 13.6%, compared to FY 2019. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to business combinations ($1.3 million combined from Capintec, Selmic, Premium Analyse, and AWST) and increased R&D activity in existing businesses to develop new products of $0.9 million.
Income (loss) from operations
Income from operations in FY 2020 was $23.0 million, a decrease of $5.8 million, or 20.1%, when compared to income from operations of $28.8 million in FY 2019. On a segment basis, income from operations was $13.9 million in the Medical segment and $59.6 million in the Industrial segment in FY 2020 compared to $10.2 million in Medical and $55.0 million in Industrial in FY 2019. Corporate expenses were $50.5 million in FY 2020 compared to $36.4 million in FY 2019. See “Business segments” and “Corporate and other” below for further details.
Interest expense
Interest expense, net was $149.2 million in FY 2020 and $143.5 million in FY 2019. The $5.7 million, or 4.0%, increase in interest expense in FY 2020 was due primarily to increased non-cash interest of $11.9 million on related-party Shareholder Notes, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to our third-party debt due to lower interest rates on third-party debt. See Note 8-Borrowings to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Loss on debt extinguishment
There was no loss on debt extinguishment in FY 2020, as compared to the FY 2019 loss on extinguishment of $12.8 million. In FY 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement, resulting in the extinguishment of previous debt. No similar debt extinguishment occurred in FY 2020.
Foreign currency (gain) loss, net
The Company recorded a gain of $0.6 million in FY 2020, compared to a gain of $3.2 million from foreign currency exchange in FY 2019. Foreign currency gain decreased $2.6 million, or 81.3%, primarily due to less favorable exchange rates in FY 2020 between the U.S. dollar and currencies used in our European operations.
Other (income) expenses, net
Other income was $1.0 million in FY 2020, compared to other expense of $1.9 million in FY 2019. The change in other (income) expenses, net from FY 2019 is primarily due to investment income received in FY 2020 compared to losses recorded on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment in FY 2019.
Income taxes
Income tax benefit was $5.5 million in FY 2020 as compared to income tax benefit of $4.2 million in FY 2019, which increased $1.3 million due to the impact of the release of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions offset by increases in valuation allowances and mix of income between U.S. and foreign operations.
Business segments
The following is an analysis of business segment results for FY 2020 as compared with FY 2019. Segment income from operations is defined as revenues less cost of revenues, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses. Costs not specifically allocated to segment operating include those discussed in further detail in the Corporate and other section below. Interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, foreign currency gain, and other income/expense are not allocated to segments. For reconciliations of segment revenues and earnings to our consolidated results, see Note 16-Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Form 10-K.
Medical
Medical revenues were $62.6 million in FY 2020, an increase of $19.7 million or 45.9% from FY 2019 primarily due to the impact of business combinations ($17.7 million from Capintec and AWST in FY 2020 and $0.9 million from the full fiscal year impact of the NRG Dosimetry Services Group (“NRG”) FY 2019 acquisition).
Income from operations was $13.9 million in FY 2020, representing an increase in earnings of $3.7 million, or 36.3%, from FY 2019 primarily due to the impact of business combinations ($1.3 million from Capintec and AWST), higher gross profit from legacy operations of $1.5 million due to product mix, and lower amortization expense related to legacy operations of $0.7 million. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues declined 1.6% primarily due to the product mix impact of business combinations, as certain products had lower margins than our legacy medical businesses.
Industrial
Industrial revenues were $415.6 million in FY 2020, an increase of $18.4 million, or 4.6% from FY 2019. Revenues increased primarily due to business combinations ($14.0 million from Selmic and Premium Analyse), new product offerings, and government year-end purchases driving increased revenues from certain customers.
Income from operations, which includes an inventory valuation impact of $1.3 million but excludes non-operational costs, was $59.6 million in FY 2020, an increase of $4.6 million, or 8.4%, compared with the prior year period, while income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased 0.5%. The $4.6 million increase in income from operations was primarily due to the impact of business combinations ($1.3 million from Selmic and Premium Analyse), lower amortization expense related to legacy operations of $3.4 million and reduced travel expenses of $1.3 million, offset by lower gross profit impact of approximately $1.4 million from legacy operations due to product mix.
Corporate and other
Corporate and other costs include costs associated with our headquarters, as well as centralized global functions including Executive, Finance, Legal and Compliance, Human Resources, Technology, Strategy, and Marketing. Corporate and other costs were $50.5 million and $36.4 million in the 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively. The $14.1 million increase in corporate and other expenses in FY 2020 versus the comparable prior year period was primarily the result of $8.8 million increase in costs to achieve synergies, acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives, an increase of $2.0 million in compensation and related costs and $1.8 million increase in professional fees. For reconciliations of segment operating income and corporate and other costs to our consolidated results, see Note 16-Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Quarterly Results of Operations
The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial data for our last seven completed fiscal quarters (Predecessor) and for the transition periods from July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021 (Predecessor Stub Period) and from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (Successor). The information for each of these periods reflects all adjustments that are of a normal, recurring nature and that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our operating results for such periods. The results of operations presented should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document and are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period. Revenues for certain quarters/periods are impacted by the capital spending patterns of government customers, which are influenced by budgetary considerations and driven by timing of fiscal year-ends.
(1)Adjusted revenues, Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted EPS, EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Adjusted revenues, Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted EPS, EBITA, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this document because they are key metrics used by management to assess our financial performance. We believe that these measures are useful because they provide investors with information regarding our operating performance that is used by our management in its reporting and planning processes. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures and disclosures reported by other companies.
Adjusted revenues are defined as U.S. GAAP revenues adjusted to remove the impact of purchase accounting on the recognition of deferred revenue. We have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded adjustments reducing deferred revenue under arrangements predating the business combination to fair value for all business combinations occurring prior. Therefore, our GAAP revenues after the date of acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. Therefore, Adjusted revenues reverses the impact of this deferred revenue write-down to provide another view of the revenue run-rate in a given period and providing meaningful information for comparative results in future periods.
Adjusted net (loss) income is defined as U.S. GAAP net income adjusted for foreign currency gains and losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, the impact of purchase accounting on the recognition of deferred revenue, changes in the fair value of warrants, certain non-operating expenses (certain purchase accounting impacts related to revenues and inventory, restructuring and costs to achieve operational synergies, merger and acquisition expenses and IT project implementation expenses), and income tax impacts of these adjustments. Adjusted EPS is defined as adjusted net (loss) income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted.
EBITA is defined as income before net interest expenses (including loss on debt extinguishment), income tax (benefit) provision, and amortization. EBITDA is defined as income before net interest expense (including loss on debt extinguishment), income tax (benefit) provision, and depreciation and amortization. EBITA and EBITDA are not terms defined under U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income as measures of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity. Additionally, EBITA and EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the items described in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a measure of operating performance. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our results of operations that management utilizes on an ongoing basis to assess our core operating performance.
EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. You should not consider our EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to operating income or net income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
(2)The following table reconciles Adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance measure, which is revenues:
(3)The following table reconciles Adjusted net income (loss) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance measure, which is net loss:
(4)The following table reconciles Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance measure, which is Net loss per common share attributable to Mirion Technologies, Inc. (Successor):
* Note that Predecessor quarters have not been presented as Adjusted EPS is not meaningful for periods prior to the Business Combination due to the change in the capital structure.
(5)The following table reconciles EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance measure, which is net loss:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview of Liquidity
Our primary future cash needs relate to working capital, operating activities, capital spending, strategic investments, and debt service.
Mirion management believes that net cash provided by operating activities, augmented by long-term debt arrangements, will provide adequate liquidity for the next 12 months of independent operations, as well as the resources necessary to invest for growth in existing businesses and manage its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis. Access to capital and availability of financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including our credit rating, economic conditions, and the overall liquidity of capital markets. There can be no assurance of continued access to capital markets on acceptable terms.
At December 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020, we had $84.0 million, $101.1 million and $118.4 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents, which include amounts held by entities outside of the United States of approximately $69.5 million, $67.3 million and $73.7 million, respectively, primarily in Europe and Canada. Non-U.S. cash is generally available for repatriation without legal restrictions, subject to certain taxes, mainly withholding taxes. We are asserting indefinite reinvestment of cash for non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company has alternative repatriation options
other than dividends should the need arise. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for up to $90.0 million of revolving borrowings.
There is a discussion in Note 8, Borrowings, of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of the long-term debt arrangements issued by Mirion.

Debt Profile
Third Party Debt Before the Business Combination
In March 2019, Mirion Technologies (HoldingRep), Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., as administrative agent, certain other revolving lenders and a syndicate of institutional lenders (the “2019 Credit Facility”). The 2019 Credit Facility originally provided for financing of a $450.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a €125.0 million senior secured term loan facility, as well as a $90.0 million revolving line of credit. The 2019 Credit Facility was amended to provide an additional $34.0 million, $66.0 million and $225.0 million of senior secured term loans in July 2019, December 2019 and December 2020, respectively.
The 2019 Credit Facility was repaid in full upon the consummation of the Business Combination and replaced with the Credit Facility (as defined below).
2021 Credit Agreement
On the Closing Date, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) among Mirion Technologies (HoldingSub2), Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales, as Holdings, Mirion Technologies (US Holdings), Inc., as the Parent Borrower, Mirion Technologies (US), Inc., as the Subsidiary Borrower, the lending institutions party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies Finance LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Joint Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners.
The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for an $830 million senior secured first lien term loan facility and a $90 million senior secured revolving facility (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”). The Credit Facilities are permitted to be used to effect the Transactions (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement), refinance the 2019 Credit Facility referred to above and for general corporate purposes. The term loan facility is scheduled to mature on October 20, 2028 and the revolving facility is scheduled to expire and mature on October 20, 2026. The agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum for unused revolving commitments, subject to stepdowns to 0.375% per annum and 0.25% per annum upon the achievement of specified leverage ratios. Any outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2021 Credit Agreement reduce the availability under the revolving line of credit.
The 2021 Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on the equity interests of the Parent Borrower owned by Holdings and substantially all of the assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the borrowers and the other guarantors thereunder. Interest with respect to the facilities is based on, at the option of the borrowers, (i) a customary base rate formula for borrowings in U.S. dollars or (ii) a floating rate formula based on LIBOR (with customary fallback provisions) for borrowings in U.S. dollars, a floating rate formula based on EURIBOR for borrowings in Euro or a floating rate formula based on SONIA for borrowings in Pounds Sterling, each as described in the 2021 Credit Agreement with respect to the applicable type of borrowing.
The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include, among others and in each case subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, limitations on incurrence of liens, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, limitations on making dividends and other distributions, limitations on engaging in asset sales, limitations on making investments, and a financial covenant that the “First Lien Net Leverage Ratio” (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter is not greater than 7.00 to 1.00 if on the last day of such fiscal quarter certain borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility exceed 40% of the total revolving credit commitments at such time. The covenants also contain limitations on the activities of Mirion Technologies (HoldingSub2), Ltd. as the “passive” holding company. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, the revolving credit commitments may be terminated and remedies against the collateral may be exercised.
Cash flows
Transition periods from October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (Successor) and July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021 (Predecessor Stub Period) Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Non-GAAP:
(1)Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. We believe that Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are important because they provide management with measurements of cash generated from operations that is available for payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as repaying debt and funding acquisitions.
Free cash flow is defined as U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities adjusted to include the impact of purchases of property, plant, and equipment and purchases of badges. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow adjusted to include the impact of cash used to fund non-operating expenses (as previously defined). We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to Free cash flow applied in presenting Adjusted free cash flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our cash flows that management utilizes on an ongoing basis to assess our ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities.
Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. You should not consider our Free cash flow or Adjusted free cash flow as alternatives to net cash provided by (used for) operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash (used in) or provided by operating activities was $(12.2) million for the Successor period and $13.1 million for the Predecessor Stub Period which was a decrease of $18.5 million over the net cash provided by operating activities of $19.4 million for the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease compared to the prior year unaudited comparable period is primarily due to a decrease in cash inflows of $15.9 million resulting from net loss adjusted for non-cash items, which was predominantly driven by Business Combination transaction fees recorded in the Predecessor Stub Period. Cash from working capital was flat, comparing the Successor and Predecessor Stub Period with the unaudited six months ended December 31, 2020. Within working capital, accounts receivable increased by $31.9 million as a result of higher billings, accrued expense decreased $1.9 million and net other assets and liabilities increased $2.9 million. These working capital cash outflows were mostly offset by an
increase in accounts payable of $14.0 million, a decrease in inventory of $1.2 million from higher sales and an increase in net, deferred contract revenue and associated deferred costs of $15.2 million.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion in the Successor period and $12.5 million in the Predecessor Stub Period. The periods reflected the Business Combination of $2.1 billion, acquisitions of $59.5 million, primarily related to CIRS of $54 million, and capital expenditures of $6.0 million and $11.6 million related to property, plant, and equipment and badges in the Successor Period and the Predecessor Stub Period, respectively.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion in the Successor period and was immaterial in the Predecessor Stub Period. Cash inflow in the Successor Period related to the Business Combination including $807.3 million of new borrowings, $753.7 million from issuance of stock, net of redemptions, $18.7 million of transaction fees reimbursed by the Sellers. These cash inflows were partially offset by $26.3 million in deferred underwriting fees and $13.3 million of stock issuance costs.
Fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2020
Non-GAAP:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $53.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2021, a $14.1 million, or 35.7%, increase compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to cash inflow resulting from a decrease in net loss adjusted for non-cash items of approximately $5.9 million and cash inflow of $8.2 million from improved working capital (cash inflows of $5.1 million in accounts payable and $23.9 million from other operating assets and liabilities, offset by cash outflows of $8.0 million in accounts receivable, $3.3 million in inventories, and $9.5 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities).
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $313.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $75.6 million in the year ended June 30, 2020. The $237.7 million, or 314.4%, increase is primarily the result of greater acquisition activity (an increase of $234.4 million) in addition to purchases of property, plant and equipment and badges. Capital expenditures were $23.2 million and $19.9 million in the year ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended June 30, 2020, respectively, related to property, plant, and equipment and badges.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $239.0 million in the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $118.9 million of cash provided in the year ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we borrowed a net $218.8 million of notes payable under the 2019 Credit Facility and a net $70.0 million of borrowings from related parties, offset by $35.0
million of repayments of borrowings on the revolver term loan and $14.8 million of repayments of principal ($8.8 million under the 2019 Credit Facility and $6.0 million of the NRG loan). During the year ended June 30, 2020, we borrowed a net $98.8 million of notes payable under the 2019 Credit Facility and $80.0 million of borrowings under the revolver, offset by $13.4 million principal repayments of notes payable, $45.0 million repayments of borrowings on the revolver term loan, $2.0 million of contingent consideration payments, and $0.4 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests.
Year ended June 30, 2020 compared to year ended June 30, 2019
Non-GAAP:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash from operating activities was $39.5 million in FY 2020, a $24.8 million, or 168.7%, increase compared to FY 2019 resulting from a decrease in net loss adjusted for non-cash items of approximately $3.2 million offset by cash inflow of $28.0 million from improved working capital (cash inflows of $12.1 million from inventories, $0.2 million from accounts payable, $20.4 million from accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $2.1 million of other operating assets and liabilities, offset by cash outflows of $6.8 million from accounts receivable).
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $75.6 million in FY 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $25.6 million in FY 2019. The $50.0 million, or 195.3%, increase is primarily the result of greater acquisition activity (an increase of $46.6 million) in addition to purchases of property, plant and equipment and badges. Capital expenditures were $19.9 million and $16.5 million in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively, related to property, plant, and equipment.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $118.9 million in FY 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $15.0 million in FY 2019. During FY 2020, we borrowed $98.8 million of notes payable (primarily under the 2019 Credit Facility) and $80.0 million of borrowings under the revolver, offset by $13.4 million principal repayments of notes payable, $45.0 million repayments of borrowings on the revolver term loan, $2.0 million of contingent consideration payments, and $0.4 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests. During FY 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was driven primarily by net borrowings due to the refinancing of debt and issuance of notes payable under the 2019 Credit Facility of $28.5 million offset by repayments of $13.0 million for the revolver.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Such estimates are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences
may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Business combinations
We account for business acquisitions in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, "Business Combinations". This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.
The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessments of factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the closing date of the acquisition. For non-observable market values, the Company determines fair value using acceptable valuation principles (e.g., multiple excess earnings, relief from royalty and cost methods).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually during the fiscal year fourth quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in ASC 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other". The Company tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The amount of goodwill acquired in a business combination that is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date is the excess of the purchase price of the acquired businesses (or portion thereof) included in the reporting unit, over the fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed from a market participant perspective. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit(s) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination even though other assets or liabilities of the acquired entity may not be assigned to that reporting unit.
ASC 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment as part of annual impairment testing, prior to a quantitative assessment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. If a qualitative assessment determines an impairment is more likely than not, the Company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. Otherwise, no further analysis is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales and margin for each reporting unit, as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests performed. Additionally, the Company assesses factors that may impact its business, including macroeconomic conditions and the related impact, market-related exposures, plans to market for sale all or a portion of the business, competitive changes, new or discontinued product lines, changes in key personnel, and any potential risks to projected financial results.
If performed, the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted by the applicable discount rate, and peer company multiples. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Based upon our review and analysis, no impairments were deemed to have occurred during any of the periods presented.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets relate to the value associated with our developed technology, customer relationships, backlog, trade names and non-compete agreements at the time of acquisition through business combinations. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 1 to 16 years.
Revenue Recognition
Prior to July 1, 2019, the Company recognized revenue based on ASC 605, "Revenue Recognition", when there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement, product delivery had occurred or services had been provided, the sales price was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured. Beginning July 1, 2019, the Company recognizes revenue based on ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of promised goods or service to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. See Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance below for a discussion of the change in revenue recognition accounting that became effective on July 1, 2019.
ASC 606
Performance Obligations
The Company identifies a performance obligation for each promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. As part of its assessment, the Company considers all goods and/or services promised in the contract, regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The Company’s contracts may contain either a single performance obligation, including the promise to transfer individual goods or services that are not separately distinct within the context of the respective contracts, or multiple performance obligations. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. Service revenues (warranty contracts, post contract support, and subscription-based services) are recognized over time as the customers receive and consume benefits of such services simultaneously.
The Company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the performance obligation. Typically, over-time revenue recognition is based on the utilization of an input measure used to measure progress, such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs. Changes in total estimated costs are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting which recognize the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods in the current period. Accordingly, the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results from operations, or cash flows. However, there were no significant changes in estimated contract costs for the Successor Period of October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and the Predecessor Stub Period of July 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021 and the Predecessor Period for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
If a performance obligation does not qualify for over-time revenue recognition, revenue is then recognized at the point-in-time in which control of the distinct good or service is transferred to the customer, typically based upon the terms of delivery.
Certain of the Company’s products are sold through distributors and third-party sales representatives under standard agreements whereby distributors purchase products from the Company and resell them to customers. These agreements give distributors the right to sell the Company’s products within certain territories and establish minimum order requirements. These arrangements do not provide stock rotation or price protection rights and do not contain extended payment terms. Rights of return are limited to repair or replacement of delivered products that are defective or fail to meet the Company’s published specifications. Provisions for these warranty costs are recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.
The remaining performance obligation for open contracts as of December 31, 2021 include assembly, delivery, installation and training. Payment terms for shipments to end-users are generally net 30 days. Payment terms for distributor shipments may range from 30 to 90 days. Service arrangements can call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g., extended warranty and service contracts), upon completion of contract milestones (e.g., custom development manufacturing), or a combination of each.
ASC 605
Prior to July 1, 2019, the Company recognized revenue from sales contracts when there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement, product delivery had occurred or services had been provided, the sales price was fixed or determinable and
collectability was reasonably assured. For sales contracts that contain customer-specific acceptance provisions, revenue and the related costs were deferred until the customer had indicated successful completion of site acceptance tests or the Company had otherwise determined that all customer-specific acceptance criteria had been met. Where the Company performed detailed factory acceptance testing on completed products, which, in some instances, was sufficiently extensive and reliable to demonstrate that its products meet the customer-specified objective acceptance criteria set forth in the related sales arrangements. In such instances, the Company recognized revenue based on delivery terms and prior to the receipt of notification of formal acceptance from the customer.
The Company combined a group of contracts as one project if they are closely related and were in substance, part of a single project with an overall project margin. The Company segmented a contract into several projects when they were of different business substance, for example, with different business negotiation, solutions, implementation plans, and margins.
The Company evaluated each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represented separate units of accounting. A deliverable constituted a separate unit of accounting when it had stand-alone value, and for an arrangement that included a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, when delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service was considered probable and is substantially controlled by the Company. The Company considers a deliverable to have stand-alone value if the product or service is sold separately by the Company or another vendor or could be resold by the customer on a stand-alone basis at an amount that would substantially recover the original purchase price. Further, the revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition.
When a sales arrangement contains multiple units of accounting, the Company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception based on each unit’s relative selling price, which is determined based on a selling price hierarchy. The relative selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. The Company is not typically able to determine VSOE or TPE and therefore uses estimated selling prices to allocate revenue between the elements of the arrangement. The Company establishes its best estimate of the selling price considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, costs and margin objectives, competitive pricing strategies and general market conditions.
The Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or future performance obligations or subject to customer-specific cancellation rights.
For all arrangements, amounts billed to a customer related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue while all costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are classified as cost of revenue. Provisions and allowances for discounts to customers, estimated sales returns, service cancellations, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.
Certain of the Company’s products are sold through distributors and third-party sales representatives under standard agreements whereby distributors purchase products from the Company and resell them to customers. These agreements give distributors the right to sell the Company’s products within certain territories and establish minimum order requirements. These arrangements do not provide stock rotation or price protection rights and do not contain extended payment terms. Rights of return are limited to repair or replacement of delivered products that are defective or fail to meet the Company’s published specifications. Provisions for these warranty costs are recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.
Revenue from certain fixed-price contracts that involve customization of equipment to customer specifications is recorded using a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis. Contract costs include all direct materials and labor costs, as well as indirect costs related to contract performance. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability result in revisions to costs and revenue and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are first determined. Revenue earned in excess of billings on contracts in progress is classified in the consolidated balance sheet as a current asset and included in costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Amounts billed in excess of revenue earned are classified as a current liability and included in deferred contract revenue.
Revenue derived from passive dosimetry and analytical services is of a subscription nature, with passive dosimetry and analytical services provided to customers on an agreed-upon recurring monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Services are provided to the customer through passive dosimeter badges that the Company supplies to customer personnel. Depending on the type of badge utilized, either customers return the used badges to the Company for analysis, or they obtain the analysis directly through a self-service web portal. The Company believes that badge production, badge wearing, badge analysis and report preparation are all integral to the benefit that the Company provides to its customers and, therefore, the service period is defined as the period over which all of these services are provided. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period as the service is continuous, and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident. Many customers pay for these measuring and monitoring services in advance. The amounts are recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and represent customer deposits invoiced in advance for services to be rendered over the service period, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations.
Pertinent to ASC 606 and 605
The Company sells its products and services mainly to large, private, and governmental organizations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific regions. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary. The Company generally does not require its customers to provide collateral or other security to support accounts receivable.
Accounting for Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company classifies all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current in the balance sheet, to the extent that the Company anticipates payment or receipt of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Derivative Warrant Liabilities
We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. In accordance with ASC Topic 825-10 “Financial Instruments”, offering costs attributable to the issuance of the derivative warrant liabilities have been allocated based on their relative fair value of total proceeds and are recognized in the statement of operations as incurred.
The Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants as of December 31, 2021 is based on observable listed prices for such warrants. As the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, we determined that the fair value of each Private Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.
