Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Overview
We are a patient-centric gene therapy company focused on developing and commercializing AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of monogenic diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS, in both rare and large patient populations. We were founded in partnership with The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, or UT Southwestern, to develop and commercialize transformative gene therapy treatments. Together with UT Southwestern, we are advancing a deep and sustainable product portfolio of gene therapy product candidates, with exclusive options to acquire several additional development programs at no cost. By combining our management team’s proven experience in gene therapy drug development and commercialization with UT Southwestern’s world-class gene therapy research capabilities, we believe we have created a powerful engine to develop transformative therapies to dramatically improve patients’ lives. In March 2022, we announced strategic pipeline prioritization initiatives focused on GAN and Rett syndrome. We will conduct small proof-of-concept studies in CLN1 disease and SLC13A5 deficiency. Development of the CLN7 program will continue in collaboration with existing partners with future clinical development to focus on the first-generation construct. All other research and development activities will be paused to increase operational efficiency.
In April 2021, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to TSHA-120, a clinical-stage, intrathecally dosed AAV9 gene therapy program for the treatment of giant axonal neuropathy, or GAN. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TSHA-120 is being conducted by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, under an accepted investigational new drug application, or IND. We reported clinical safety and functional MFM32 data from this trial for the highest dose cohort of 3.5x1014 total vg in January 2022, where we saw continued clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression similar to that achieved with the lower dose cohorts, which we considered confirmatory of disease modification. For Rett syndrome, we submitted a CTA filing in November 2021 and announced initiation of clinical development of TSHA-102 under a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) approved by Health Canada in March 2022. We expect to report preliminary clinical data for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome by year-end 2022. We recently executed an exclusive option from UT Southwestern to license worldwide rights to a clinical-stage CLN7 program. The CLN7 program is currently in a Phase 1 clinical proof-of-concept trial run by UT Southwestern, and we reported preliminary clinical safety data for the first patient in history to be intrathecally dosed at 1.0x1015 total vg with the first-generation construct in December 2021. Development of the CLN7 program will continue in collaboration with existing partners with future clinical development to focus on the first-generation construct. We will conduct small proof-of-concept studies in CLN1 disease and SLC13A5 deficiency that we believe can further validate our platform. We plan to initiate clinical development on TSHA-105 for the treatment of SLC13A5 in 2022.
We have a limited operating history. Since our inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and entering into collaboration agreements for conducting preclinical research and development activities for our product candidates. All our lead product candidates are still in the clinical or preclinical development stage. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity, raising an aggregate of $307.0 million of gross proceeds from our initial public offering and private placements of our convertible preferred stock. In addition, we drew $30.0 million and $10.0 million in term loans on August 12, 2021 and December 29, 2021, respectively.
On August 12, 2021, or the Closing Date, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the Lenders and Silicon Valley Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders, or the Agent. The Term Loan Agreement provides for (i) on the Closing Date, $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans available through December 31, 2021, (ii) from January 1, 2022 until September 30, 2022, an additional $20.0 million term loan facility available at the Company’s option upon having three distinct and active clinical stage programs, determined at the discretion of the Agent, at the time of draw, (iii) from October 1, 2022 until March 31, 2023, an additional $20.0 million term loan facility available at our option upon having three distinct and active clinical stage programs, determined at the discretion of the Agent, at the time of draw and (iv) from April 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023, an additional $20.0 million term loan facility available upon approval by the Agent and the Lenders, or, collectively, the Term Loans. We drew $30.0 million in term loans on the Closing Date and drew an additional $10.0 million term loan on December 29, 2021. The loan repayment schedule provides for interest only payments until August 31, 2024, followed by consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each term loan is due and payable in full on August 1, 2026.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $174.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of
$235.6 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•
continue to advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and preclinical and discovery programs;
•
conduct our ongoing clinical trials of TSHA-101, TSHA-102, TSHA-118, TSHA-120 and TSHA-121, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials of TSHA-105 and any other current and future product candidates that we advance;
•
seek regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
continue to develop our gene therapy product candidate pipeline and next-generation platforms;
•
scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;
•
manufacture current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP material for clinical trials or potential commercial sales;
•
establish and validate a commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility;
•
establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up internal and external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional clinical, manufacturing quality control, regulatory, manufacturing and scientific and administrative personnel;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and
•
incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.
License Agreements
Research, Collaboration and License Agreement with The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
In November 2019, we entered into the UT Southwestern Agreement with The Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of UT Southwestern, as amended in April 2020.
In connection with the UT Southwestern Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under certain patent rights of UT Southwestern and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under certain know-how of UT Southwestern, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import licensed products for use in certain specified indications. Additionally, we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under certain patents and know-how of UT Southwestern for use in all human uses, with a right of first refusal to obtain an exclusive license under certain of such patent rights and an option to negotiate an exclusive license under other of such patent rights. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize at least one licensed product.
In connection with the entry into the UT Southwestern Agreement, we issued to UT Southwestern 2,179,000 shares of our common stock. We are aware that UTSW has sold all such shares as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not have any future milestone or royalty obligations to UT Southwestern under the UT Southwestern Agreement, other than costs related to the maintenance of patents.
License Agreement with Queen’s University
In February 2020, we entered into the Queen’s University Agreement with Queen’s University. In connection with the Queen’s University Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patent rights and know-how of Queen’s University, including certain improvements to the foregoing, to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import licensed products and otherwise exploit such patents and know-how for use in certain specified indications. We also obtained an exclusive right of first negotiation to license certain next generation technology and improvements of Queen’s University that do not constitute an already-licensed improvement to the licensed technology.
In connection with the Queen’s University Agreement, we paid Queen’s University a one-time fee of $3.0 million as an upfront fee and approximately $0.2 million to reimburse Queen’s University for certain plasmid production costs. We are obligated to pay Queen’s University up to $10.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones and up to $10.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain commercial milestones, a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain
customary reductions, and a percentage of non-royalty sublicensing revenue ranging in the low double digits. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis and country-by-country basis until expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country and the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such country. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Queen’s University a low double-digit portion of any amounts received by us in connection with the sale of a PRV related to a licensed product, not to exceed a low eight-figure amount.
In connection with a separate research grant agreement with Queen’s University, we reimbursed Queen’s University for certain manufacturing production costs totaling $3.8 million.
License Agreement with Abeona (CLN1 Disease)
In August 2020, we entered into the Abeona CLN1 Agreement with Abeona. In connection with the Abeona CLN1 Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses under certain patents, know-how and materials originally developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Abeona to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, and commercialize licensed products for gene therapy for the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of CLN1 Disease (one of the forms of Batten disease) in humans.
In connection with the license grant, we paid Abeona a one-time upfront license fee of $3.0 million. We are obligated to pay Abeona up to $26.0 million in regulatory-related milestones and up to $30.0 million in sales-related milestones per licensed product and high single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration or revocation or complete rejection of the last licensed patent covering such licensed product in the country where the licensed product is sold, the loss of market exclusivity in such country where the product is sold, or, if no licensed product exists in such country and no market exclusivity exists in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In addition, concurrent with the Abeona CLN1 Agreement we entered into a purchase and reimbursement agreement with Abeona, pursuant to which we purchased specified inventory from Abeona and reimbursed Abeona for certain research and development costs previously incurred for total consideration of $4.0 million. In December 2021 a regulatory milestone was triggered in connection with this agreement and therefore we recorded $3.0 million within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. The milestone fee was paid in January 2022.
The Abeona CLN1 Agreement expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the expiration of the last royalty term of a licensed product. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of the agreement or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon specified prior written notice to Abeona.
License Agreement with Abeona (Rett Syndrome)
In October 2020, we entered into the Abeona Rett Agreement with Abeona pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses under certain patents, know-how and materials originally developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Edinburgh and Abeona to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, and commercialize licensed products for gene therapy and the use of related transgenes for Rett syndrome.
Subject to certain obligations of Abeona, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one licensed product and commercialize at least one licensed product in the United States.
In connection with the Abeona Rett Agreement, we paid Abeona a one-time upfront license fee of $3.0 million. We are obligated to pay Abeona up to $26.5 million in regulatory-related milestones and up to $30.0 million in sales-related milestones per licensed product and high single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration or revocation or complete rejection of the last licensed patent covering such licensed product in the country where the licensed product is sold, the loss of market exclusivity in such country where the product is sold, or, if no licensed product exists in such country and no market exclusivity exists in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
The Abeona Rett Agreement expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the expiration of the last royalty term of a licensed product. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of the agreement or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon specified prior written notice to Abeona.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
We have been actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation and its impact globally. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 were not impacted by COVID-19, and we currently do not expect any material impact on our financial results in 2022. We believe the remote working arrangements and travel restrictions imposed by various governmental jurisdictions have had limited impact on our ability to maintain internal operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business and operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat COVID-19 and the availability, timing and effectiveness of a vaccine, both domestically and globally. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, including to our planned clinical trials and preclinical studies. Any such shutdowns or other business interruptions could result in material and negative effects to our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not recognized any revenue from any sources, including from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products, if approved, in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses primarily consist of preclinical development of our product candidates and discovery efforts, including conducting preclinical studies, manufacturing development efforts, preparing for clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses through asset acquisitions are charged to research and development expense if the licensed technology has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. Research and development expenses include or could include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation, other related costs for those employees involved in research and development efforts;
•
license maintenance fees and milestone fees incurred in connection with various license agreements;
•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with consultants, contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites and consultants to conduct our preclinical studies;
•
costs related to manufacturing material for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•
laboratory supplies and research materials;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, insurance and equipment.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and manufacturing processes and conduct discovery and research activities for our preclinical programs. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate’s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. Our clinical development costs are expected to increase significantly as we commence clinical trials. Our future expenses may vary significantly each period based on factors such as:
•
expenses incurred to conduct preclinical studies required to advance our product candidates into clinical development;
•
per patient trial costs, including based on the number of doses that patients received;
•
the number of patients who enroll in each trial;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate;
•
third-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;
•
the ability to manufacture of our product candidates;
•
regulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist or will consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and audit and tax-related services and insurance costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our expanded infrastructure, as well as the initiation and continuation of our preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. We also anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of payments for accounting, audit, legal, consulting services, as well as costs associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, director and officer liability insurance, investor and public relations activities and other expenses associated with operating as a public company.
Results of Operations
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $100.0 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $38.3 million of expenses
incurred in research and development manufacturing and other raw material purchases, which included cGMP batches produced by Catalent and UT Southwestern. We also incurred an increase in employee compensation and expenses of $32.7 million, which included $7.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, due to an increase in the employee headcount in the research and development function. We also incurred an increase of $29.0 million of third-party research and development consulting fees, primarily related to GLP toxicology studies, clinical study CRO activities, and consulting for regulatory and clinical studies.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of approximately $30.2 million was primarily attributable to $16.3 million of incremental compensation expense, which included $7.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, due to increases in employee headcount. We also incurred an increase of $13.9 million in professional fees related to legal, insurance, investor relations/communications, accounting, personnel recruiting, market research and patient advocacy activities.
Other Expense
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of interest expense incurred under the Term Loan Agreement.
Interest Income
Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of interest earned on our savings account.
Change in Fair Value of Preferred Stock Tranche Liability
We determined that our obligation to issue, and the investors’ right to purchase, additional shares of Series A convertible preferred stock pursuant to the milestone closings represented a freestanding financial instrument, or the tranche liability. The tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value. We concluded that the tranche liability met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as it was legally detachable and separately exercisable from the initial closing of the Series A convertible preferred stock.
On June 30, 2020, ahead of the anticipated closing of the Series B preferred stock financing at a purchase price of $17.00 per share on July 2, 2020, certain investors elected to exercise in full their options to purchase their pro-rata portion of the milestone shares prior to our achievement of the clinical milestones and purchased 200,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock. We remeasured the fair value of the entire tranche liability at June 30, 2020, and recognized a non-cash expense of approximately $17.0 million. The tranche liability was extinguished upon the issuance of the Series A milestone shares on July 1, 2020 and July 2, 2020, and no additional changes in fair value were recorded.
Sources of Liquidity
Overview
Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $149.1 million. We have funded our operations primarily through equity financings, raising an aggregate of $307.0 million in gross proceeds from our initial public offering and private placements of convertible preferred stock. Specifically, between March and July 2020, we closed on the sale of an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of $30.0 million. In July and August 2020, we closed on the sale of an aggregate of 5,647,048 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of $96.0 million. In September 2020, we raised gross proceeds of $181.0 million in our initial public offering.
On August 12, 2021, or the Closing Date, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the Lenders and Silicon Valley Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders, or the Agent. The Term Loan Agreement provides for (i) on the Closing Date, $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans available through December 31, 2021, (ii) from January 1, 2022 until September 30, 2022, an additional $20.0 million term loan facility available at the Company’s option upon having three distinct and active clinical stage programs, determined at the discretion of the Agent, at the time of draw, (iii) from October 1, 2022 until March 31, 2023, an additional $20.0 million term loan facility available at our option upon having three distinct and active clinical stage programs, determined at the discretion of the Agent, at the time of draw and (iv) from April 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023, an additional $20.0 million term loan facility available upon approval by the Agent and the Lenders, or, collectively, the Term Loans. We drew $30.0 million in term loans on the Closing Date and an additional $10.0 million in term loans on December 29, 2021. The loan repayment schedule provides for interest only payments until August 31, 2024, followed by
consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each term loan is due and payable in full on August 1, 2026.
On October 5, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units or any combination thereof up to a total aggregate offering price of $350.0 million. We also simultaneously entered into a Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, or the Sales Agents, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time at our discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million through the Sales Agents. In March 2022, we amended the Sales Agreement to, among other things, include Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as an additional Sales Agent. As of December 31, 2021, no shares of common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement.
Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved drug products, and we do not expect to generate substantial revenue for at least the next few years. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenue will be compromised. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, initiate clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, as well as build out of our cGMP manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina. In addition, if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements consisted of $29.2 million in total lease payments under our noncancelable leases for equipment, laboratory space and office space entered into in 2021 and $22.9 million in total lease payments under our noncancelable lease for manufacturing space entered into in 2020. These leases are described in further detail in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements located in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most significant purchase commitments consist of approximately $12.0 million related to the build-out of our cGMP manufacturing facility and $8.1 million in cancellable purchase obligations to our CROs.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with full access to the term loan facility, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into the fourth quarter of 2023. This estimate reflects that our strategic prioritization efforts to improve operating efficiency, including pausing development of TSHA-101 and the reduction of our headcount by approximately 35% in March 2022. We will require additional capital to fund the research and development of our product candidates, to fund our manufacturing activities, to fund precommercial activities of our programs and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biological products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the scope, progress, costs and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for TSHA-101, TSHA-102, TSHA-105, TSHA-118, TSHA-120, TSHA-121 and any current and future product candidates that we advance;
•
our ability to access sufficient additional capital on a timely basis and on favorable terms, including with respect to our term loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank;
•
the extent to which we develop, in-license or acquire other product candidates and technologies in our gene therapy product candidate pipeline;
•
the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as we advance them through preclinical and clinical development;
•
the number and development requirements of product candidates that we may pursue;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development capabilities and establish a commercial infrastructure;
•
the costs of establishing and maintaining our own commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing, including the remaining tranches of our Term Loan Facility, to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the terms of these equity securities or this debt may restrict our ability to operate. The Term Loan Agreement contains negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions. Any future additional debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting and restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into profit-sharing or other arrangements or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
We are continuing to assess the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and operations. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business and operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the duration and effect of business disruptions and the short-term effects and ultimate effectiveness of the travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing requirements and business closures in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, the efficacy, availability and adoption of vaccines, both domestically and globally, and the impact of new variants or mutations of the coronavirus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, a continued and growing pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net cash used in operating activities of $117.0 million primarily consisted of a net loss of $174.5 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development expenses. The net loss of $174.5 million was partially offset by $28.8 million in adjustments for non-cash items, primarily due to stock-based compensation expense of $18.2 million, and the add back of the up-front license fee of $5.5 million paid to HHF related to the acquisition of TSHA-120 which is treated as an investing outflow, and the regulatory milestone fee of $3.0 million due to Abeona in connection with the CLN1 Agreement, as well as other license fees of $1.3 million. The $174.5 million net loss was also partially offset by a source of cash of $28.7 million from the change in our operating assets and liabilities, primarily resulting from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash used in operating activities of $30.7 million primarily consisted of a net loss of $60.0 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development expenses. The net loss of $60.0 million was partially offset by $29.4 million in adjustments for non-cash items, primarily due to the change in the fair value of the preferred stock tranche liability of $17.0 million and stock-based compensation expense of $3.4 million, as well as the upfront payment to acquire the license rights
pursuant to the Queen’s University Agreement for $3.0 million, and the upfront payments related to the Abeona CLN1 and Rett Agreements for $3.0 million each, all of which were recorded as a component of research and development expenses and were reported as investing cash outflows.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, investing activities used $21.6 million of cash primarily attributable to the up-front license fee payment of $5.5 million to acquire exclusive worldwide rights to TSHA-120, for the treatment of GAN, and capital expenditures related to our in-house manufacturing facility and office space. During the year ended December 31, 2020, investing activities used $9.1 million of cash primarily attributable to the upfront fees paid pursuant to the Queen’s University Agreement, the Abeona CLN1 Agreement and the Abeona Rett Agreement.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided $39.1 million of cash, which was attributable to the receipt of $40.0 million net proceeds from our Term Loan with Silicon Valley Bank, partially offset by $0.4 million of cash paid for costs related to our filing of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and $0.5 million in other financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities provided $291.1 million of cash, which was primarily attributable to the receipt of $165.9 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering, $95.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Series B convertible preferred stock and $29.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Series A convertible preferred stock.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to research and development expenses, the preferred stock tranche liability and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements located in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.
Research and Development Costs
We have entered into research and development contracts with research institutions and other companies. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected on the balance sheet as prepaid or accrued expenses. We record accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs.
Research and development costs primarily consist of payroll, stock-based compensation, clinical trial expense, certain manufacturing costs, laboratory costs and other supplies, and the cost to acquire third-party licenses.
Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses through asset acquisitions are charged to research and development expense if the licensed technology has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use.
To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of accrued research and development liabilities after a reporting period. However, due to the nature of estimates, there is no assurance that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical studies and other research activities.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for all stock-based payments to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock awards, or “RSAs” and restricted stock units or, “RSUs” based on their respective grant date fair values. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is affected principally by the estimated fair value of shares of our common stock and requires management to make a number of other assumptions, including the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the historical share volatility of a set of comparable publicly traded companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the options. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of our stock options is determined using the “simplified” method. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Prior to September 23, 2020, the fair value of common stock underlying our stock options, RSAs and RSUs was estimated by our board of directors considering, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of our common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms. After the IPO, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as reported on the date of the grant.
The RSAs and RSUs are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The Company expenses stock-based compensation related to stock options, RSAs and RSUs over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. Stock-based compensation costs are generally recorded in research and development expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the respective employee’s roles within our Company, however a portion of stock-based compensation related to employees who are directly involved in the manufacturing facility buildout, is capitalized into the cost basis of the manufacturing plant. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur.
Preferred Stock Tranche liability
We determined that our obligation to issue, and the investors’ right to purchase, additional shares of Series A convertible preferred stock pursuant to the milestone closings represent a freestanding financial instrument, or the tranche liability. The tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value. The proceeds from the sale of the convertible preferred stock are first allocated to the fair value of the tranche liability, with the remaining proceeds from the sale of the convertible preferred stock allocated to the Series A convertible preferred stock. The tranche liability is remeasured at each reporting period and upon the exercise or expiration of the obligation, with gains and losses arising from subsequent changes in its fair value recognized as a component of other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. At the time of the exercise or expiration of the tranche liability, any remaining value of the tranche liability is reclassified to convertible preferred stock on the consolidated balance sheet. Between June 30, 2020 and July 2, 2020, all of the 4,000,000 Milestone Shares were issued and the related tranche liability was extinguished in its entirety, and we reclassified the entire tranche liability of $18.1 million to convertible preferred stock on the consolidated balance sheets.
We estimated the fair value of the tranche liability using a Monte Carlo simulation at the initial issuance date. As of March 4, 2020, the simulations occurred based on our implied aggregate equity value derived from the Series A convertible preferred stock offering price of $3.00 per share, along with, in part, the following subjective assumptions: risk-free rate of 0.59%, an expected volatility of 80%, the expected term to a liquidity event of one year and a 60% probability of achieving the clinical milestones and timing thereof. Subsequently, we estimated the fair value of the tranche liability using a backsolve approach at June 30, 2020, which was calculated based on our aggregate equity value derived from the Series B convertible preferred stock offering price of $17.00 per share. The subsequent remeasurement also considered, in part, a risk-free rate of 0.17%, an expected volatility of 80% and the expected term to a liquidity event of 0.5 years.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements located in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
•
an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
•
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements;
•
exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
•
an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on financial statements. We may take advantage of these provisions until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to qualify as an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of: (i) December 31, 2025, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in total annual gross revenues, (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over the prior three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. We have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
