ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly those under “Risk Factors.”
Overview
We have developed the Pure-Vu System, a medical device that has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) to help facilitate the cleansing of a poorly prepared gastrointestinal tract during colonoscopy and to help facilitate upper gastrointestinal (“GI”) endoscopy procedures. The Pure-Vu System is also CE marked in the European Economic Area (EEA) for use in colonoscopy. The Pure-Vu System integrates with standard and slim colonoscopes, as well as gastroscopes, to improve visualization during colonoscopy and upper GI procedures while preserving established procedural workflow and techniques. Through irrigation and evacuation of debris, the Pure-Vu System is designed to provide better-quality exams. Challenges exist for inpatient colonoscopy and endoscopy, particularly for patients who are elderly, with comorbidities, or active bleeds, where the ability to visualize, diagnose and treat is often compromised due to debris, including fecal matter, blood, or blood clots. We believe this is especially true in high acuity patients, like GI bleeding where the existence of blood and blood clots can impair a physician’s view and removing them can be critical in allowing a physician the ability to identify and treat the source of bleeding on a timely basis. We believe use of the Pure-Vu System may lead to positive outcomes and lower costs for hospitals by safely and quickly improving visualization of the colon and upper GI tract, potentially enabling effective diagnosis and treatment without delay. In multiple clinical studies to date, involving the treatment of challenging inpatient and outpatient cases, the Pure-Vu System has consistently helped achieve adequate bowel cleanliness rates greater than 95% following a reduced prep regimen. We also believe that the technology may be useful in the future as a tool to help reduce user dependency on conventional pre-procedural bowel prep regimens. Based on our review and analysis of 2019 market data and 2021 projections for the U.S. and Europe, as obtained from iData Research Inc., we believe that during 2021 approximately 1.5 million inpatient colonoscopy procedures were performed in the U.S. and approximately 4.8 million worldwide. Upper GI bleeds occurred in the U.S. at a rate of approximately 400,000 cases per year in 2019, according to iData Research Inc. The Pure-Vu System has been assigned an ICD-10 code in the US. The system does not currently have unique codes with any private or governmental third-party payors in any other country or for any other use; however, we intend to pursue reimbursement activities in the future, particularly in the outpatient colonoscopy market. We recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our Pure-Vu EVS System and expect to commence commercialization by the end of Q1 2022. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales until the COVID-19 pandemic has fully subsided and we further expand our commercialization efforts, which is subject to significant uncertainty.
Financial Operations Overview
We have generated limited revenues to date from the sale of products. We have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses each year since our inception, including a loss of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and we expect to continue to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2021, we had $22.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of $122.8 million. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities to commercialize and market the Pure-Vu System, including additional expenditures in sales and marketing personnel, clinical affairs and manufacturing. Accordingly, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. The source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our product and clinical development programs as well as commercial activities. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so. Furthermore, the extent of the impact and effects of the recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19 on the operation and financial performance of our business will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, related travel advisories and restrictions, production delays, or the uncertainty with respect to the accessibility of additional liquidity or capital markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the demand for our Pure-Vu system is impacted by this outbreak for an extended period, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
● continue to expand commercialization;
● scale manufacturing with our contracted partners for both the workstation and disposable portions of the Pure-Vu System;
● develop future generations of the Pure-Vu System to improve user interface, optimize handling and reduce the cost structure;
● raise sufficient funds to effectuate our business plan, including commercialization activities and reimbursement efforts related to our Pure-Vu System and our research and development activities, including clinical and regulatory development, and the continued development and enhancement of our Pure-Vu System; and
● operate as a public company.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgement and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue recognition
We generate revenue from the sale or lease of our Pure-Vu System Workstation (“Workstation”) and from the sale of our single-use disposable sleeves (“Disposables”), and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our Workstations. See Note 3 for further discussion of revenue recognition.
Sales of our Workstation and Disposables are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to. Revenue from the sale of a Workstation is recognized after a customer commits to purchase the Workstation and the Workstation is delivered, which is when title is transferred. Disposables are identified as a separate performance obligation, and therefore, revenue from the sale of Disposables is recognized when the Disposables are delivered to the customer and title is transferred.
For contracts outside the scope of ASC 606, we determine income for proposed supply arrangements with an embedded lease in accordance with ASC 842 and certain components of sales within the proposed supply arrangement in accordance with ASC 606. We allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations within the proposed supply arrangements using the total estimated purchases method for both (i) arrangements that contain minimum purchase commitments and (ii) those arrangements that do not contain a minimum purchase commitment, but instead offer a volume discount for purchases that exceed a specified tier.
Inventory
Inventory is accounted for at lower of cost and net realizable value using the weighted average cost method and is evaluated at least annually for impairment. Write-downs for potentially obsolete or excess inventory are made based on management’s analysis of inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts.
Share-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation programs grant awards that have included stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units. Grants are awarded to employees and non-employees, including directors.
We account for our share-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss based on their fair values.
We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant and revising those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards for which performance or service conditions are expected to be satisfied.
Our share-based awards are subject to service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, directors and non-employees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term.
We expense restricted stock unit awards to employees based on the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the associated service period of the award.
We estimate the fair value of our option awards to employees, directors and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the calculation of expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate and (iv) expected dividends. Due to the lack of complete company-specific historical and implied volatility data for the full expected term of the stock-based awards, we base our estimate of expected volatility on a representative group of publicly traded companies in addition to our own volatility data. For these analyses, we selected companies with comparable characteristics to our own, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby, the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to its lack of sufficient historical data. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. We have never paid, and do not expect to pay, dividends in the foreseeable future.
Contingent Royalty Obligation
We estimate and record a contingent royalty obligation at fair value in relation to our royalty obligation, which is payable over the life of certain patents after certain conditions are met. Forecasted revenue over an expected life of the product is the largest driver of the estimated obligation at fair value, with other factors being growth rate, patent expiration assessments, and the discount rate. All these drivers are subject to a high degree of uncertainty which we determine at present based on a very limited-commercialized product.
Emerging Growth Company Status
Under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Results of Operations
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue
As of December 31, 2021, as part of our initial launch, we have generated a small amount of revenue from the sales of products. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales until we expand our commercialization efforts for the Pure-Vu EVS System, which is subject to significant uncertainty.
Revenue totaled $391.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $98.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $293.0 thousand was largely driven by the limited improvement in in-hospital commercial activity in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales growth in 2021 continued to be hampered, though, by the impact of COVID-19 in U.S. hospitals.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $624.0 thousand, compared to $496.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $128.0 thousand was primarily attributable to the net increase of inventory impairment of $42.0 thousand, due to the lengthening of sales cycles and lower than anticipated sales volume in light of COVID-19 and the anticipated launch of the Pure-Vu EVS System in 2022, and an increase in the volume sold of our evaluation and commercial units of $86.0 thousand.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of costs relating to the advancement of our development and clinical programs for the Pure-Vu System. We have research and development capabilities in electrical and mechanical engineering with laboratories in our facility in Israel for development and prototyping, and electronics design and testing. We also use consultants and third-party design houses to complement our internal capabilities.
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $5.3 million, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $0.3 million was primarily attributable to decreases of $0.5 million in salaries and other personnel related costs, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in material costs and other research and development costs.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs primarily related to our sales and marketing personnel and infrastructure supporting the commercialization of the second generation Pure-Vu System.
Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $3.1 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $0.4 million was primarily attributable to decreases of $0.6 million in salaries and other personnel related cost and promotional items of $0.2 million, partially offset by increases in professional services of $0.2 million and other sales and marketing costs of $0.1 million.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our overall operations and being a public company. These costs include personnel, legal and financial professional services, insurance, investor relations, compliance related fees, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $9.3 million, compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $0.3 million was primarily attributed to decreases of $0.9 million in salaries and other personnel related cost, $0.2 million in professional services, $0.1 million in lease cancellation costs, partially offset by increases of $0.1 million in investor and public relation costs, insurance premiums of $0.2 million and share-based compensation of $0.6 million.
Other Income and Expenses
Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $1.1 million compared to other expense, net of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $0.9 million in other expenses, net was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.3 million in finance expense, an increase of $0.4 million from the loss on the change in estimated fair value of contingent royalty obligation and a loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the Silicon Valley Bank loan of $0.2 million in 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have generated minimal revenues, experienced negative operating cash flows and have incurred substantial operating losses from our activities. We expect operating costs will increase significantly as we incur costs associated with commercialization activities related to the Pure-Vu System. We expect to continue to fund our operations primarily through utilization of our current financial resources, future product sales, and through the issuance of debt or equity.
On August 28, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) under which we sold and issued to an institutional investor (the “Holder”), in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 3,200,000 shares of our Common Stock par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,533,625 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”). The offering price was $1.145 for each share of Common Stock and $1.144 for each Pre-Funded Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $0.001 per share of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, in a concurrent private placement, we also agreed to issue to the Holder warrants to purchase up to 8,733,625 shares of Common Stock (the “Private Placement Warrants”). These warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $1.30 per share and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. In connection with the closing of the offering, we received gross proceeds of $10.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses of $0.8 million from the issuance of the Common Stock, the Pre-Funded Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants.
On January 27, 2021, we entered into a Warrant Exercise Agreement (the “Exercise Agreement”) with the Holder, at which time 8,000,000 of the Private Placement Warrants remained outstanding, due to the prior exercise of 733,625 of the Private Placement Warrants on January 22, 2021. Pursuant to the Exercise Agreement, in order to induce the Holder to exercise all of its remaining outstanding 8,000,000 Private Placement Warrants for cash, we agreed to sell to the Holder, new warrants (the “New Warrants”) to purchase 0.75 shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock issued upon such exercise of the remaining 8,000,000 Private Placement Warrants pursuant to the Exercise Agreement, or an aggregate of 6,000,000 New Warrants. The terms of the New Warrants are substantially similar to those of the Private Placement Warrants, except that the New Warrants will have an exercise price of $2.12, will be immediately exercisable and will expire five years from the date of the Exercise Agreement. In addition, the Holder paid a cash payment of $0.10 for each New Warrant issued to the Holder, for an aggregate of $600,000 to the Company. We received aggregate gross proceeds before expenses of approximately $11.0 million from the exercise of all of the remaining 8,000,000 outstanding Private Placement Warrants held by the Holder and the payment of the purchase price for the New Warrants.
In connection with the Exercise Agreement, we entered into a financial advisory agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“A.G.P.”), pursuant to which A.G.P. acted as exclusive financial advisor to us in this transaction and received a cash fee of $300,000 upon full cash exercise of the Private Placement Warrants. As additional compensation, A.G.P. will receive a cash fee equal to $200,000 upon the cash exercise in full of the New Warrants.
In March 2021, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Oppenheimer, under which it may offer and sell from time to time common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we sold approximately 1.3 million shares of Common Stock pursuant to the above-described Equity Distribution Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds of $1.8 million, after deducting issuance costs of $0.1 million. Upon the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333- 254343), including the accompanying prospectus and related prospectus supplements related to the “at the market offering” pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement is subject to the provisions of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which provides that we may not sell securities in a public primary offering with a value exceeding one-third of our public float in any twelve-month period unless our public float is at least $75 million. As of March 25, 2022, the Company’s public float (i.e., the aggregate market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates) was approximately $23.4 million, which was calculated based on 51,946,084 shares of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates at a price of $0.45 per share, the closing price of our common shares on February 10, 2022. As a result of the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6, and in accordance with the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we are now restricted to the offer and sale of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to approximately $7.8 million from time to time through Oppenheimer. If our public float meets or exceeds $75.0 million at any time, we will no longer be subject to the restrictions set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, at least until the filing of our next Section 10(a)(3) update as required under the Securities Act.
On July 16, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a loan facility (the “Kreos Loan Agreement”) with Kreos Capital VI (Expert Fund) LP (the “Lender”). Under the Kreos Loan Agreement, Lender will provide us with access to term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $12.0 million. We drew $9.0 million of term loans pursuant to the Kreos Loan Agreement on the Effective Date, and applied $8.2 million of the proceeds, inclusive of a negotiated prepayment premium of approximately $0.2 million, to repay in full all amounts outstanding under, and discharge all obligations in respect of our prior Loan and Security Agreement, entered into in December 2019, as was amended from time to time, (the “SVB Loan Agreement”) with Silicon Valley Bank. As a result, the SVB Loan Agreement, together with all documents and agreements executed in connection therewith, including certain liquidity covenants, have terminated and all liens associated therewith have been released as of the Effective Date. We intend to use the remaining proceeds of the Kreos Loan Agreement to enhance our product development and commercial growth plans, and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2021, we drew down the full $3.0 million aggregate principal amount of Tranche C.
We have been continuously evaluating the actual and potential business impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the full impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, the financial markets have been subject to significant volatility that adversely impacts our ability to enter into, modify, and negotiate favorable terms and conditions relative to equity and debt financing initiatives. The uncertain financial markets, potential disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities could also affect our ability to enter into key agreements. The outbreak and government measures taken in response to the pandemic have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, have spiked, while demand for other goods and services have fallen. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain. We and our third-party contract manufacturers, contract research organizations, and clinical sites may also face disruptions in procuring items that are essential to our research and development activities, including, for example, medical and laboratory supplies, in each case, that are sourced from abroad or for which there are shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak.
Our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of our Annual Report on Form 10K, depends on our ability to execute our business plan, increase revenue and reduce expenditures. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.6 million and an accumulated deficit of $122.8 million. Based on our current business plan, we believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into Q1 2023. We will need to raise significant additional capital to continue to fund operations. We may seek to sell common or preferred equity, convertible debt securities or seek other debt financing. In addition, we may seek to raise cash through collaborative agreements or from government grants. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. The source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our product and clinical development programs as well as commercial activities. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us, among other things, to delay, scale back or eliminate expenses including those associated with our planned product development, clinical trial and commercial efforts.
These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For more information, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Shelf Registration Statement
On March 26, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2019 Shelf Registration Statement”), which was declared effective on April 24, 2019, that allows us to offer, issue and sell up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $75.0 million of any combination of our Common Stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, subscription rights and/or units from time to time, together or separately, in one or more offerings. Each issuance under the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued. As of December 31, 2021, we have sold approximately $31.9 million of securities under our shelf registration statement. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings.
On March 16, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement (File No. 333-254343) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2021 Shelf Registration Statement”), which was declared effective on March 26, 2021, that allows us to offer, issue and sell up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $100.0 million of any combination of our Common Stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, subscription rights and/or units from time to time, together or separately, in one or more offerings. As of December 31, 2021, we have not sold any securities under the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, except as described below.
The 2021 Shelf Registration Statement includes a prospectus registering the at-the-market offering program pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement with Oppenheimer, under which we may offer and sell from time to time common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold approximately 1.3 million shares of Common Stock pursuant to the above-described Equity Distribution Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds of $1.8 million, after deducting issuance costs of $0.1 million.
Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings. Each issuance under the shelf registration statements will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued.
