Overview
We are a cell and gene therapy company focused on the research, development, and commercialization of transformative treatments for cancer. We were incorporated in April 2021 and are led by an accomplished team with significant expertise and experience in this field, from discovery through clinical development to regulatory approval of idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, marketed as ABECMA®). Our approach combines our expertise in T cell engineering technology and lentiviral vector gene delivery approaches, experience in research, development, and manufacturing of cell therapies and a suite of technologies that can be selectively deployed to develop highly innovative, targeted cellular therapies for patients with cancer. We are advancing multiple preclinical and clinical programs in oncology and, together with our partner, delivering ide-cel to multiple myeloma patients in the United States following approval by the FDA of ide-cel in March 2021 for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.
We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses since inception. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $292.2 million, $120.1 million and $320.6 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years as we:
•advance our next-generation programs in B-NHL, AML, and multiple myeloma through the clinic;
•manufacture clinical study drug product and materials and establish the infrastructure necessary to support and develop manufacturing capabilities;
•seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development;
•increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates and technologies in oncology; and
•incur costs related to our separation from bluebird bio into an independent publicly traded company.
We plan to build a facility at our existing headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts to manufacture drug product for our future Phase 1 clinical trials, but currently, all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties, including Resilience. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to carry out our clinical development activities. As we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin commercialization following marketing approval, if obtained, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution at such time. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales, we will continue to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other
sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $362.2 million. Based on our current operating plans, including with respect to the ongoing commercialization of ABECMA, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although we intend to pursue additional cash resources through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties.
In March 2022, we entered into stock purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a private placement, an aggregate of 13,934,427 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of $12.20. This resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $170 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us.
Separation from bluebird bio, Inc.
2seventy bio is a Delaware corporation. We did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity prior to our separation from bluebird bio on November 4, 2021. Our historical financial statements for periods prior to the separation have been prepared on a carve-out basis and are derived from bluebird bio’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records. Our financial statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. See Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation, in the notes to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on the preparation and basis of presentation of the financial statements. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows historically operated as part of bluebird bio’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows prior to and until the distribution of our common stock to bluebird bio’s stockholders. The historical consolidated and combined financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented.
On November 4, 2021, bluebird bio completed the separation and spin-off of its oncology portfolio and programs into 2seventy bio, retaining its severe genetic disease portfolio and programs. In connection with the separation, certain assets and liabilities, including certain accounts receivables and accounts payables, included on the consolidated and combined balance sheets prior to the separation have been retained by bluebird bio post-separation and, therefore, were adjusted through net parent investment in our consolidated and combined financial statements. In addition, in connection with the separation, certain equity awards were converted in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, as further described in Note 13, Stock-based compensation. As a result of the separation, our net parent investment balance was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
Our revenues have been derived from collaboration arrangements and out-licensing arrangements, primarily related to our collaboration arrangement with BMS as part of which we are jointly commercializing ABECMA in the United States. To date, we have not recognized any revenue from the sale of products.
Revenue recognized under collaborative arrangements has been generated primarily from a collaboration arrangement between bluebird bio and BMS, which was assigned to and assumed by us in connection with the separation. The terms of the BMS collaboration arrangement with respect to ide-cel contain multiple promised goods or services, which included at inception: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to ide-cel, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into ide-cel under the license. As of September 2017, the BMS collaboration also included the following promised goods or services with respect to bb21217: (i)
research and development services, (ii) a license to bb21217, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into bb21217 under the license. An agreement was entered into with BMS to co-develop and co-promote ide-cel in March 2018, which was subsequently amended in May 2020, as part of which both parties will share equally in U.S. costs and profits. Revenue from our collaborative arrangements is recognized as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.
We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, which includes determining whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606 or ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, we apply the five-step model prescribed in Topic 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. In arrangements where we do not deem our collaborator to be our customer, payments to and from our collaborator are presented in the consolidated and combined statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the nature of the payments, as summarized in the table and further described below.
Where the collaborator is the principal in the product sales, we recognize our share of any profits or losses, representing net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercial and other expenses, in the period in which such underlying sales occur and costs are incurred by the collaborator. We also recognize our share of costs arising from research and development activities performed by collaborators in the period our collaborators incur such expenses.
Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606, or ASU 2018-18, on a retrospective basis. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the new standard. As we recognize revenue under our collaborative arrangements both within and outside the scope of Topic 606, we present revenue on our consolidated and combined statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows: service revenue includes revenue from collaborative partners recognized within the scope of Topic 606 and collaborative arrangement revenue includes only revenue from collaborative partners recognized outside the scope of Topic 606.
Nonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license provided there are no unsatisfied performance obligations in the arrangement. License revenue has historically been generated from out-license agreements, under which we may also recognize revenue from potential future milestone payments and royalties.
For arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;
•expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;
•reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities, including to BMS for ABECMA and bb21217;
•facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;
•costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;
•milestones and upfront license payments;
•costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and
•amortization of certain intangible assets.
Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:
•CRB-401 study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
•KarMMA study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 study to examine the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
•KarMMa-2 study - a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 2 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in high-risk multiple myeloma.
•KarMMa-3 study - a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of ide-cel versus standard triplet regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
•KarMMa-4 study - a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1 study intended to determine the optimal target dose and safety of ide-cel in subjects with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma.
•CRB-402 study - an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of the bb21217 product candidate in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We are winding down the study in 2022.
•CRC-403 study - an open-label, multi-site Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study to examine the safety and efficacy of bbT369 in relapsed and/or refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).
•PLAT-08 study - an open-label Phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of DARIC33 in pediatric and young adult relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing
of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates including:
•the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;
•future clinical study results;
•uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;
•new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our lentiviral vector or drug product;
•regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and
•the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.
We expect our ongoing research and development expenses to be driven mainly by our advancement of DARIC33 and bbT369 clinical programs through phase 1 studies, funding our share of the costs of development of ABECMA, including clinical expansion to earlier lines of therapy, through our collaboration with BMS and manufacture clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.
Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below:
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, insurance, IT costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors’ fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
Share of Collaboration Loss
Share of collaboration loss represents our share of net loss arising from product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercial costs and other expenses related to the commercialization of a product where the collaborator is the principal in the product sales.
Cost of Royalty and Other Revenue
Cost of royalty and other revenue represents expenses associated with amounts owed to third-party licensors as a result of revenue recognized under our out-license arrangements.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
On June 30, 2014, bluebird bio acquired Pregenen. All assets, liabilities and future obligations related to the Pregenen acquisition, including the resulting intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration, were assumed by us in connection with the separation. The agreement provided for up to $135.0 million in future contingent cash payments upon the achievement of certain preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones related to the Pregenen technology.
As of December 31, 2021, there were $99.9 million in future contingent cash payments related to commercial milestones. We estimate future contingent cash payments have a fair value of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2021, which are classified within other non-current liabilities on our consolidated and combined balance sheet.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net consists primarily of income resulting from the allocation of facility-related, depreciation and amortization expense to bluebird bio for its proportional use of assets that were assumed by us, as well as expense resulting from the allocation of facility-related, depreciation and amortization expense to us for our proportional use of assets that were not assumed by us. Other income, net also includes immaterial rental income and gains and losses on disposal of assets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Estimates and judgments are used in the following areas, among others: allocations of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities from bluebird bio's historical consolidated financial statements to us for periods prior to the separation, future undiscounted cash flows and subsequent fair value estimates used to assess potential and measure any impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, contingent consideration, stock-based compensation expense, accrued expenses, income taxes, and the assessment of our ability to fund operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognition
Under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer’s discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.
We assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the license terms, the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.
The transaction price is determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their stand-alone selling prices, or SSP. on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.
If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. The amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is resolved. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust
our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.
If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.
For arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.
In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.
We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.
We recognize revenue within the following financial statement captions:
Service Revenue
To date, our service revenue has primarily been generated from the elements of the collaboration arrangement with BMS that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, using the five-step model described above. As discussed further in Collaborative arrangement revenue below, we analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808 or Topic 606. For the elements of the arrangement which are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606, we record the related revenue as service revenue on the consolidated and combined statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Refer to Collaborative Arrangement Revenue below for additional discussion around our policy for recognizing collaborative arrangement revenue and the determination of whether elements of a collaboration arrangement are within the scope of ASC 808 or Topic 606.
Collaborative Arrangement Revenue
To date, collaborative arrangement revenue has been primarily generated from the collaboration arrangements with BMS and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, as further described in Note 10, Collaborative arrangements, in the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements. Refer to -Financial Operations Overview-Revenue above.
The recognition of service revenue and collaborative arrangement revenue (expense) require management judgment due to the fact that the terms of our collaboration arrangements are complicated and the nature of the collaborative activities change over time. This process includes the identification of costs that we incur that relate to each particular collaboration arrangement, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgment.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
We recognize expenses related to clinical studies based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.
Other examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•collaboration partners for research performed in connection with ongoing collaboration arrangements;
•investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;
•vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and
•vendors related to the development, manufacturing, and distribution of clinical trial materials.
Stock-based compensation
Our share-based compensation expense relates to stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. Grants are awarded to employees and non-employees, including our board of directors.
We account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated and combined statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values.
Our stock-based awards are subject to either service, performance-based, or market-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.
We estimate the fair value of our option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the calculation of expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. Due to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we based our estimate of expected volatility on the estimate and expected volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded companies. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. For awards granted subsequent to the separation from bluebird bio, we have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby, the expected term equals the
arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to its lack of sufficient historical data. For stock options that were converted in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, as discussed above and as further described in Note 13, Stock-based compensation, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have estimated the expected term to be the remaining contractual term of the awards as of the date of the separation. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. We have never paid, and do not expect to pay, dividends in the foreseeable future.
For performance-based restricted stock units that vest based on a total shareholder return metric, the vesting condition is considered a market condition as it vests based on the movement in share price of a company. The impact of the market condition is reflected in the award’s fair value on the grant date, and the expense is recognized irrespective of whether the market condition is achieved as long as the required service is provided.
We account for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards for which performance or service conditions are expected to be satisfied.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation, in the notes to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.
Results of Operations
Historically, for periods prior to the separation from bluebird bio, our operations were managed in the normal course of business as part of bluebird bio. Accordingly, for periods prior to the separation from bluebird bio certain shared costs have been allocated to us and reflected as expenses in the stand-alone consolidated and combined financial statements, as described in greater detail in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements. We considered the allocation methodologies used to be a reasonable and appropriate reflection of the historical bluebird bio expenses attributable to us for purposes of the stand-alone financial statements. The expenses reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements may not be indicative of expenses that will be incurred by us in the future. The following discussion summarizes the key factors we believe are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated and combined financial statements.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue. Total revenue was $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $248.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021, revenue amounts consisted of our share of commercial profits from ABECMA sales, ide-cel related service revenue and collaboration revenue with our collaboration partners whereas in 2020, revenue amounts primarily consisted of a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue in connection with the May 2020 BMS contract modification.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $261.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $296.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall decrease of $34.5 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•$49.6 million of decreased manufacturing-related expenditures. This decrease was primarily driven by the approval of ABECMA in 2021, resulting in recognition of adherent lentiviral vector expense as part of our share of commercial profit instead of within research and development expenses, and an overall decrease in drug product manufacturing for the CRB-402 study as the study is winding down;
•$4.0 million of decreased clinical trial costs, partially driven by the wind down of the CRB-402 study; and
•$3.6 million of decreased license and milestone fees.
These decreased costs were partially offset by:
•$17.3 million of increased costs related to employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses;
•$4.7 million of increased IT and other facility-related costs; and
•$3.1 million of increased collaboration research funding.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $2.6 million was primarily due to the following:
•$2.1 million of increased IT and other facility-related costs; and
•$1.1 million of increased costs associated with ABECMA commercial activities, a portion of which is being reimbursed to the Company under our collaboration agreement with BMS.
Share of Collaboration Loss. Share of collaboration loss represents our share of net loss in the second quarter of 2021 arising from the commercialization of ABECMA under the BMS collaboration. In the third and fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an aggregate of $19.4 million of collaboration revenue from the commercialization of ABECMA, which is included as a component of collaborative arrangement revenue. Refer to - Financial Operations Overview - Revenue above and Note 10, Collaborative arrangements, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our revenue recognition and presentation policies with respect to ABECMA commercial activities. Our full-year collaboration profit for ABECMA commercial activities was $9.4 million.
Cost of Royalty and Other Revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease aligns with the decrease in royalty and other revenue in the same periods.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.
Other Income, Net. The $3.6 million increase in other income, net was primarily due to a refund of license fees.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Revenue. Total revenue was $248.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $203.8 million was primarily attributable to a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue in connection with the May 2020 BMS contract modification, as well as an increase in royalty and other revenue primarily attributable to revenue recognized under an out-license agreement.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $296.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $297.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $1.2 million was primarily attributable to $26.5 million of decreased material production and other platform costs, primarily due to BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification.
These decreased costs were partially offset by the following increases:
•$14.0 million of increased collaboration research funding costs, primarily due to an increase in collaboration costs incurred by BMS, of which we pay a portion, as a result of BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;
•$7.3 million of increased license and milestone fees;
•$3.2 million of increased consulting fees; and
•$1.5 million of increased research and development related IT and facility-related costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $9.3 million was primarily due to the following:
•$7.5 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense;
•$2.6 million of increased IT and facility-related costs; and
•$1.8 million of increased costs related to commercial activities.
These increased costs were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in consulting costs.
Cost of Royalty and Other Revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.
Other Income, Net. The decrease in other income, net was primarily related to a decrease of $2.3 million in other income resulting from the allocation of facility-related and depreciation expense to bluebird bio for its proportional use of assets that will be attributed to us.
Note on the COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. As a result, we continue to experience disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. We continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, for periods prior to the separation from bluebird bio, the primary source of liquidity for our business was cash flow allocated to us from bluebird bio. Prior to separation, transfers of cash to and from bluebird bio have been reflected in net parent investment in the historical consolidated and combined balance sheets, statements of cash flows and statements of equity (deficit). Accordingly, for periods prior to the separation we have not reported cash or cash equivalents. bluebird bio continued to fund our cash needs through the date of the separation. Upon separation, bluebird bio funded us with approximately $441.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, of which $140.8 million was cash and cash equivalents, $267.7 million was marketable securities and $33.0 million was restricted cash.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $362.2 million. In March 2022, we entered into stock purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a private placement, an aggregate of 13,934,427 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of $12.20. This resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $170 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us. Based on our current operating plans, including with respect to the ongoing commercialization of ABECMA, we expect our cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We intend to pursue additional cash resources through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all, and some could be dilutive to existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be forced to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our planned research or development programs or be unable to expand our operations. We previously concluded that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in prior periods due to our need to obtain additional funding, which we received from bluebird bio upon separation.
We have incurred losses and have experienced negative operating cash flows for all periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a loss of $292.2 million and used $207.0 million of cash in operations. We will continue to incur research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses and we expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the next few years.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $207.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and primarily consisted of a net loss of $292.2 million adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation of $54.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $16.4 million, and the change in fair value of the contingent consideration of $0.4 million, as well as the change in our net working capital.
Net cash used in operating activities was $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and primarily consisted of a net loss of $120.1 million adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation of $61.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $13.2 million, and the change in fair value of the contingent consideration of $6.5 million, as well as the change in our net working capital.
Net cash used in operating activities was $208.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of a net loss of $320.6 million adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation of $62.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $12.6 million, and the change in fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.7 million, as well as the change in our net working capital.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by $35.0 million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, which was offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment of $11.6 million and purchases of intangible assets of $8.0 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $22.3 million and relates to purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $59.8 million and relates to purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Prior to the separation, bluebird bio managed our cash and financing arrangements. Accordingly, all excess cash generated through earnings was deemed remitted to bluebird bio and all sources of cash were deemed funded by bluebird bio.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $354.9 million. The amount includes net cash transferred to us from bluebird bio based on changes in our cash used for operating and investing activities prior to the separation and the cash distributed to us upon separation.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $90.1 million and was due to cash transferred to us from bluebird bio based on changes in our cash used for operating and investing activities.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $267.7 million and was primarily due to cash transferred to us from bluebird bio based on changes in our cash used for operating and investing activities.
Funding Requirements
Following the separation, we intend to incur costs in support of the following activities:
•development of DARIC33 and bbT369, including conduct of PLAT-08, the Phase 1 study of DARIC33 in pediatric and young adult relapsed or refractory AML and CRC-403, the Phase 1/2 Study of bbT369 in relapsed and/or refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL);
•advancement of the KarMMA trials for ABECMA in additional indications, pursuant to our cost sharing arrangements with BMS;
•development of our pipeline of early research programs;
•the planned build-out of our drug product manufacturing capabilities at our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters, which will enable rapid translational research in our clinical trials and the manufacture of drug product for preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development activities; and
•additional research discovery efforts, other capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other general corporate activities.
We also expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
In March 2022, we entered into stock purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue, in a private placement, an aggregate of 13,934,427 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of $12.20. This resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $170 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us.
Based on our current operating plans, including with respect to the ongoing commercialization of ABECMA, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities following the separation will be sufficient to fund current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. The scope of
our future funding requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•the costs of future activities, including medical affairs, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;
•the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any products for which we may receive regulatory approval;
•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; and
•the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, this could result in dilution and could adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, debt financing would result in increased fixed payment obligations.
If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Lease Commitments
60 Binney Street Lease
In September 2015, bluebird bio entered into a lease agreement, which was assigned to us in connection with the separation, for office and laboratory space located at 60 Binney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the lease, starting on October 1, 2016, we leased approximately 253,108 square feet of office and laboratory space at $72.50 per square foot per year, or $18.4 million per year in base rent, which is subject to scheduled annual rent increases of 1.75% plus certain operating expenses and taxes. bluebird bio historically maintained a $13.8 million collateralized letter of credit which, subject to the terms of the lease and certain reduction requirements specified therein, including market capitalization requirements, could decrease to $9.2 million over time. The lease would continue until March 31, 2027. Pursuant to a work letter entered into in connection with the lease, the
landlord contributed an aggregate of $42.4 million toward the cost of construction and tenant improvements for the building.
In October 2021, bluebird bio entered into a consent to assignment and amendment to its lease agreement for its 60 Binney Street lease, pursuant to which bluebird bio's interest in the lease was assigned to us. In November 2021, we executed a $25.0 million letter of credit related to this lease. Under the assigned and amended lease agreement, the lease term was extended through March 31, 2034 with the 2022 base rent being $90.00 per square foot per year, or $22.8 million per year in base rent, subject to scheduled annual rent increases of 3.0% plus certain operating expenses and taxes. Starting April 1, 2026, the base rent will reset to $118.41 per square foot per year, or $30.0 million per year in base rent, subject to scheduled annual rent increases of 3.0% plus certain operating expenses and taxes.
Seattle, Washington Leases
In July 2018, bluebird bio entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space located in a portion of a building in Seattle, Washington. This lease was assigned to us in connection with the separation. The lease was amended in October 2018 to increase the total rentable space to approximately 36,126 square feet at $54.00 per square foot in base rent per year, which is subject to scheduled annual rent increases of 2.5% plus certain operating expenses and taxes. The lease commenced on January 1, 2019 and the lease term will continue through January 31, 2027. We moved into the facility in June 2019. The lease allowed for a tenant improvement allowance of up to $215.00 per square foot, or approximately $8.0 million. We utilized the $8.0 million tenant improvement allowance and it has been fully reimbursed by the landlord.
In September 2019, bluebird bio entered into a second amendment to the lease, or the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment added approximately 22,188 square feet to the existing space and extended the lease term of the entire premises by 16 months, or until April 2028. Fixed monthly rent for the expanded space will be incurred at a rate of $62.80 per square foot per year beginning in January 2021, subject to annual increases of 2.5%. The Second Amendment includes a five-year option to extend the term. In September 2020, bluebird bio entered into a sublease agreement for the 22,188 square feet added under the Second Amendment at a fixed monthly rent of $62.80 per square foot per year beginning in January 2021, subject to annual increases of 2.5%. The sublease term will continue through April 2028.
In October 2021, bluebird bio entered into a consent to assignment and amendment to its lease agreement for office and laboratory space in Seattle, Washington and the related sublease that was executed in September 2020 for a portion of the space. The agreement reassigns bluebird bio’s interest in the lease and the sublease to us. As part of the assignment, the sublease agreement associated with the expanded space was also assigned to us. In November 2021, we executed a $5.0 million letter of credit related to this lease.
Contingent Consideration Related to Business Combinations
In connection with the Pregenen acquisition, bluebird bio agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former equityholders of Pregenen. All assets and liabilities related to the Pregenen acquisition, including the resulting goodwill and contingent consideration, was attributed to us in connection with the separation. In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, these contingent cash payments are recorded as a component of other non-current liabilities on our consolidated and combined balance sheets at fair value. During the second quarter of 2017, a $5.0 million preclinical milestone was achieved, which resulted in a $5.0 million payment to the former equityholders of Pregenen during the third quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate remaining undiscounted amount of contingent consideration potentially payable is $99.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, is reflected as a non-current liability in the consolidated and combined balance sheets, which represents the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations as of that date.
Contingent Milestone and Royalty Payments
We also have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing
of a BLA, approval by the FDA or product launch). We do not recognize these commitments in our financial statements until they become payable or have been paid.
Based on our development plans as of December 31, 2021, we may be obligated to make future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments on future sales of specified products associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of such milestones or sales. Because the achievement of these milestones or sales had not occurred as of December 31, 2021, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments and sales-based royalties are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent upon success.
•Under a license agreement with Biogen Inc., which was attributed to us in the separation, pursuant to which we license certain patents and patent applications related to ide-cel, we are required to make payments related to certain development milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $23.0 million in the aggregate for each licensed product upon the achievement of remaining milestones. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid fees of $18.0 million to Biogen upon the achievement of milestones for products covered by in-licensed intellectual property. These milestone payments were subject to the cost-sharing provisions of the BMS collaboration arrangement. Upon commercialization of ABECMA, which is covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we are obligated to pay a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits.
•Under a license agreement with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, which was attributed to us in the separation, pursuant to which we license certain patent applications related to ide-cel, we have agreed to certain development and regulatory milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $9.7 million in the aggregate for a licensed product upon the achievement of these milestones. Upon commercialization of ABECMA, which is covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we are obligated to pay NIH a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. The royalties payable under this license agreement are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid fees of $6.5 million to NIH upon milestones reached for products covered by in-licensed intellectual property. These milestone payments were subject to the cost-sharing provisions of the BMS collaboration arrangement.
•Under a license and collaboration agreement with Gritstone Oncology Inc., or Gritstone, which was attributed to us in the separation, we may utilize Gritstone’s proprietary technology platform to identify and validate tumor-specific targets, among other activities under our research plan. We may be obligated to pay up to $129.0 million in the aggregate per therapy product and $27.5 million in the aggregate per target product for development, regulatory, and commercial milestones as well as low single-digit tiered royalty payments based on annual net sales.
•Under a license and collaboration agreement with Inhibrx, Inc., or Inhibrx, which was attributed to us in the separation, we will research, develop and commercialize chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies using Inhibrx’s proprietary single domain antibody (sdAb) platform to multiple cancer targets. We may be obligated to pay up to $51.5 million in the aggregate per target for development, regulatory, and commercial milestones as well as mid-single-digit tiered royalty payments based on annual net sales.
•In connection with the separation, bluebird bio granted us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up license (or, as the case may be, including with respect to patents licensed to bluebird bio by Pasteur Institute, Research Development Foundation, or RDF, and SIRION Biotech GmbH, or SIRION, sublicense) to certain intellectual property to allow us to use such intellectual property in connection with our ongoing and future research and development activities and product candidates. For already commercialized products and upon commercialization of our future products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we are and will be obligated to pay a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid fees of $1.0 million to RDF upon
milestones reached for products covered by in-licensed intellectual property. These milestone payments were subject to the cost-sharing provisions of the BMS collaboration arrangement.
Other Funding Commitments
Concurrent with the sale of the manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina, bluebird bio also entered into a commercial supply agreement and a development manufacturing supply agreement with Resilience. Certain rights and obligations under the asset purchase agreement and certain of the ancillary agreements, including two manufacturing agreements, among others, were assigned by bluebird bio to us on November 4, 2021 upon our separation from bluebird bio. The assignments under the asset purchase agreement and the development manufacturing supply agreement commit us to reimburse Resilience for an amount equal to 50% of the net operating losses of and relating to the manufacturing facility incurred during the twelve-month period ending on the first anniversary of the closing of the transaction, as calculated in accordance with the asset purchase agreement, subject to a cap of $15.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has accrued $2.6 million related to the net operating losses of the manufacturing facility. In exchange, under the terms of the development manufacturing supply agreement, we will receive up to eight batches of lentiviral vector during the twelve-month period ending on the first anniversary of the closing of the transaction. We have therefore committed to a minimum purchase equal to at least our 50% share of the net operating losses during the twelve-month period ending on the first anniversary of the closing of the transaction.
Additionally, we are party to various contracts with contract research organizations and contract manufacturers that generally provide for termination on notice, with the exact amounts in the event of termination to be based on the timing of the termination and the terms of the agreement.
We have various manufacturing development and license agreements to support clinical and commercial product needs. The following table presents non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from these arrangements:
In January 2022, we entered into an agreement with a contract manufacturer which includes non-cancelable contractual obligations of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Separation From bluebird bio and Costs to Operate as an Independent Company
For historical periods prior to the separation from bluebird bio, the combined financial statements reflect our operating results and financial position as it was operated by bluebird bio, rather than as an independent company. We will incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company. These costs will include the cost of various corporate headquarters functions, incremental information technology-related costs and incremental costs to operate stand-alone accounting, legal and other administrative functions. We will also incur non-recurring expenses and non-recurring capital expenditures.
As an independent company, our information technology operating costs may be higher than the costs allocated in the historical consolidated and combined financial statements for periods prior to the separation. In addition, we will incur non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures to establish independent information technology systems.
We are currently building our accounting and other administrative infrastructure. We have entered into a transition services agreement with bluebird bio which provides us with certain services and resources related to corporate functions for an initial term of two years. This transition services agreement allows us to operate our business independently prior to establishing stand-alone infrastructure. During the transition from bluebird bio, we will incur non-recurring expenses to expand our infrastructure.
It is not practicable to estimate the costs that would have been incurred in each of the periods presented in the historical financial statements for the functions described above. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we
operated as a stand-alone company during these periods would have depended on various factors, including organizational design, outsourcing and other strategic decisions related to corporate functions, information technology and back-office infrastructure.
Transactions with Related and Certain Other Parties
On November 3, 2021, in connection with the separation and distribution, we entered into certain agreements with bluebird bio relating and giving effect to the separation, including a separation agreement, two transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an intellectual property license agreement and an employee matters agreement. The terms of these agreements, including information on the business purpose of such agreements, transaction prices, related ongoing contractual commitments and any related special risks or contingencies are discussed in greater detail in Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies.
