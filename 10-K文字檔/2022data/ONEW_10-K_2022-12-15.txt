Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to OneWater Marine Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described in this Form 10-K under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” In light of these risk, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
Overview
We believe that we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States with 96 dealerships, 12 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces as of September 30, 2022. Our dealer groups are located within highly attractive markets throughout the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, many of which are in the top twenty states for marine retail expenditures. We believe that we are a market leader by volume in sales of premium boats in 13 of the markets in which we operate. In addition to boat sales, we also generate sales from related products including finance & insurance and service, parts and other sales. The recent acquisitions of T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem will significantly expand our sales of marine parts and accessories. The combination of our significant scale, diverse inventory, access to premium boat brands, access to a broad array of parts and accessories and meaningful group brand equity enables us to provide a consistently professional experience as reflected in the number of our repeat customers and Dealership same-store sales growth.
We were formed in 2014 as OneWater LLC through the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine, which created a marine retail platform that collectively owned and operated 19 dealerships. Since the combination in 2014, we have acquired a total of 75 additional dealerships, 12 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces through 30 acquisitions. Our current portfolio as of September 30, 2022 consists of multiple brands which are recognized on a local, regional or national basis. Because of this, we believe we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States based on number of dealerships and total boats sold. While we have opportunistically opened new dealerships in select markets, we believe that it is generally more effective economically and operationally to acquire existing dealerships with experienced staff and established reputations.
Effective August 9, 2022, our reportable segments changed as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Ocean Bio-Chem, which changed management’s reporting structure and operating activities. We now report our operations through two new reportable segments: Dealerships and Distribution.
As of September 30, 2022, the Dealerships reporting segment includes operations of 96 dealerships in 15 states including Florida, Texas, Alabama and Georgia, among others, and represents approximately 92% of revenues. The Dealership segment engages in the sale of new and pre-owned boats, arranges financing and insurance products, performs repairs and maintenance services, offers marine related parts and accessories and offers slip and storage accommodations in certain locations.
As of September 30, 2022, the Distribution reporting segment includes the activity of PartsVu, Ocean Bio Chem and T-H Marine and its subsidiaries which together operate 12 distribution centers/warehouses in Alabama, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Tennessee and Illinois and represents approximately 8% of revenues. The Distribution segment engages in the manufacturing, assembly and distribution of marine related products (and adjacent industries).
The boat dealership market is highly fragmented and is comprised of approximately 4,200 dealerships nationwide. Most competing boat retailers are operated by local business owners who own three or fewer stores; however we do have other large competitors including MarineMax and Bass Pro Shops. We believe we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States. Despite our size, we comprise less than 3% of total industry sales. Our scale and business model allow us to leverage our extensive inventory to provide consumers with the ability to find a boat that matches their preferences (e.g., make, model, color, configuration and other options) and to deliver the boat within days while providing a personalized sales experience. In addition to boat sales, we also generate sales from related products including finance & insurance and service, parts and other sales. The recent acquisitions of T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem have significantly expanded our sales of marine parts and accessories. Our strategic growth in this area is also expected to materially expand our addressable market in the parts and accessories business. We are able to operate with a comparatively higher degree of profitability than other independent retailers because we allocate support resources across our broader base, focus on high-margin service parts and accessories, utilize floor plan financing and provide core back-office functions on a scale that many independent retailers are unable to match. We seek to be the leading marine retailer by total market share within each boating market and within the product segments in which we participate. To the extent that we are not, we will evaluate acquiring other local retailers in order to increase our sales, to add additional brands or to provide us with additional high-quality personnel.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects, including restraints on U.S. economic and leisure activities, has and may continue to have a significant impact on our operations and financial condition. National, state and local governments in affected regions previously implemented and in the future may reimplement safety precautions, including shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings, including boat shows, and other measures. At times, these measures have affected our ability to sell and service boats, required us to temporarily close or partially close certain locations and may require additional closures in the future.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects have, to date, positively impacted our sales as more customers desire to engage in outdoor recreational activities that can be enjoyed close to first or second homes, in a socially distanced manner. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant supply chain challenges as suppliers were, and continue to be, faced with business closures and shipping delays. This has led to an industry wide inventory shortage of boats, engines and certain marine parts. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects may continue to interfere with the ability of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations with respect to the operation of our business.
While we continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2022 suggest that spending in all our regions and across product lines has proven resilient despite the challenges posed by the pandemic as customers have continued to focus on socially distanced outdoor recreations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and dependent on various factors including consumer demand, a possible resurgence of COVID-19, including variants of the virus in certain geographic areas, our ability to safely operate locations and the existence and extent of a prolonged economic downturn.
Trends and Other Factors Impacting Our Performance
Acquisitions
We are a highly acquisitive company. Since the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine in 2014, we have acquired 75 additional dealerships through 25 dealer group acquisitions. Our team remains focused on expanding our dealership growth in regions with strong boating cultures, enhancing the customer experience and generating value for our shareholders. In addition to dealership acquisitions, the Company has strategically acquired parts and accessories companies as part of our growth and diversification strategy. We have acquired 12 distribution centers and warehouses through the acquisition of 5 parts and accessories companies. We plan to continue to strategically evaluate and complete acquisitions moving forward. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we completed 8 and 5 acquisitions, respectively.
Since September 30, 2022 we have completed the acquisitions of Taylor Marine Centers and Harbor View Marine as of October 1, 2022 and December 1, 2022, respectively.
We have an extensive acquisition track record within the retail marine industry and believe we have developed a reputation for treating sellers and their staff in an honest and fair manner. We typically retain the management team and name of the acquired group. We believe this practice preserves customer relationships and goodwill in the local marketplace. We believe our reputation and scale have positioned us as a buyer of choice for marine retailers who want to sell their businesses. Our strategy is to acquire dealerships at attractive EBITDA multiples and then grow same-store sales while benefitting from cost-reducing synergies. Historically, we have typically acquired dealerships for less than 4.0x EBITDA on a trailing twelve month basis and believe that we will be able to continue to make attractive acquisitions within this range. With the expansion of our Distribution segment, we look to acquire parts and accessories manufacturing and distribution companies within a range of 5.0x - 10.0x EBITDA on a trailing twelve month basis, depending on the size of the business.
General Economic Conditions
General economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results. Unfavorable local, regional, national, or global economic developments or uncertainties, including the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain constraints, or a prolonged economic downturn, could reduce consumer spending and adversely affect our business. Consumer spending on discretionary goods may also decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels, higher interest rates or higher fuel costs, even if prevailing economic conditions are otherwise favorable. Economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships, particularly in the Southeast, can have a major impact on our overall results of operations. Local influences, such as corporate downsizing and inclement weather such as hurricanes and other storms, environmental conditions, global public health concerns and events could adversely affect our operations in certain markets and in certain periods. Any extended period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence is likely to have a negative effect on our business.
Our business was significantly impacted during the recessionary period that began in 2007. This period of weakness in consumer spending and depressed economic conditions had a substantial negative effect on our operating results. In response to these conditions we reduced our inventory purchases, closed certain dealerships and reduced headcount. Additionally, in an effort to counteract the downturn, we increased our focus on pre-owned sales, parts and repair services, and finance & insurance services. As a result, we surpassed our pre-recession sales levels in less than 24 months. While we believe the measures we took significantly reduced the impact of the downturn on the business, we cannot guarantee similar results in the event of a future downturn. Additionally, we cannot predict the timing or length of unfavorable economic or industry conditions, including a downturn as a result of pandemics, rising interest rates, inflation, or the extent to which they could adversely affect our operating results.
Although past economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results, we believe we are capable of responding in a manner that allows us to substantially outperform the industry and gain market share. We believe our ability to capture such market share enables us to align our retail strategies with the desires of customers. We expect our core strengths, including retail and acquisition strategies, will allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities as they occur, despite market conditions.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of new and pre-owned boat inventory is determined using the specific identification method. New and pre-owned boat sales histories indicated that the overwhelming majority of such boats are sold for, or in excess of, the cost to purchase those boats. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value, we consider the aging of the boats, historical sales of a particular product and current market conditions. There are inherent uncertainties in assessing net realizable value as management must make assumptions and apply judgment to changes in the market, brands and other factors that drive consumer preferences and spending. The cost of acquired, manufactured and assembled parts and accessories is determined using methods which vary by subsidiary and include both the average cost method and first-in, first-out. Inventory is reported net of write downs for obsolete and slow moving items of approximately $3.0 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million at September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Others (“ASC 350”), we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference would represent the amount of required goodwill impairment in accordance with ASC 350. To the extent the reporting unit’s earnings decline significantly or there are changes in one or more of these inputs that would result in a lower valuation, it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value and thus require the Company to record goodwill impairment.
Identifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions we have completed consist of trade names, developed technologies, including design libraries, and customer relationships. We have determined that trade names have an indefinite life, as there is no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate value as long as the trade name is utilized by the marine retailer, and therefore, are not subject to amortization. Developed technologies and customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of ten years and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Impairment testing requires the assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to whether there has been a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset and/or significant or adverse changes in cash flow projections or earnings forecasts. These assessments require management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates regarding the macroeconomic and industry conditions, our financial performance, and other factors. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was greater than its carrying amount, and as a result, no impairment for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was required for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the judgements and assumptions used in our qualitative assessment that would result in a material effect on our operating results.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. Determination of the estimated fair value assigned to each asset acquired or liability assumed can materially impact the net income in subsequent periods through depreciation and amortization and potential impairment charges.
The most critical areas of judgment in applying the acquisition method include selecting the appropriate valuation techniques and assumptions that are used to measure the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value, particularly for inventory, contingent consideration, trade names, developed technologies, including design libraries, and customer relationships. The fair value of acquired inventory is based on manufacturer invoice cost, curtailments, and market data. The significant estimates used to value contingent consideration are future earnings and discount rates. Management estimated the fair value of the trade names and developed technologies using the relief from royalty method and customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value determination of the trade names and design libraries required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future revenues and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate. The fair value determination of the customer relationships require management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future revenues attributable to existing customers, future EBITDA margins and the selection of the customer attrition rate and discount rate. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value.
In selecting the techniques and assumptions noted above, we generally engage third-party, independent valuation professionals to assist us in developing the assumptions and applying the valuation techniques to a particular business combination transaction. In particular, the discount rates selected are compared to and evaluated with (i) the industry weighted-average cost of capital, (ii) the inherent risks associated with each type of asset and (iii) the level and timing of future cash flows appropriately reflecting market participant assumptions.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Revenue
We have a diversified revenue profile that is comprised of new boat sales, pre-owned boat sales, finance & insurance products, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories. During different phases of the economic cycle, consumer behavior may shift away from new boats; however, we are well-positioned to benefit from revenue from pre-owned boats, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories, which have all historically increased during periods of economic uncertainty. We generate pre-owned sales from boats traded-in for new and pre-owned boats, boats purchased from customers, brokerage transactions, consignment sales and wholesale sales. We continue to focus on all aspects of our business including non-boat sales of finance & insurance products, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories. Although non-boat sales contributed approximately 17.8%, 11.3% and 9.8% to revenue in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the higher gross margin on these product and service lines, non-boat sales contributed 30.1%, 25.8% and 28.3% to gross profit in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have also diversified our business across geographies, dealership types (e.g., fresh water and salt water), and product offerings (e.g., focus on parts and accessories businesses through PartsVu, T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem) in order to reduce the effects of seasonality and cyclicality of our business. In addition to seasonality, revenue and operating results may be significantly affected by quarter-to-quarter changes in economic conditions, manufacturer incentive programs, adverse weather conditions and other developments outside of our control.
Gross Profit
We calculate gross profit as revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of actual amounts paid for products, costs of services (primarily labor), transportation costs from manufacturers to our dealerships and vendor consideration. Gross profit excludes the majority of our depreciation and amortization, which is presented separately in our consolidated statements of operations.
Gross Profit Margin
Our overall gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Sales of new and pre-owned boats, which have comparable margins, generally result in a lower gross profit margin than our non-boat sales. As a result, when revenue from non-boat sales increases as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions and incentive compensation), or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long term. We typically evaluate our variable expenses, selling expenses and all other selling, general, and administrative expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total revenue.
Dealership Same-Store Sales
We assess the organic growth of our Dealership segment revenue on a same-store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same-store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial results and provides relevant information to assess our performance. New and acquired dealerships become eligible for inclusion in the comparable dealership base at the end of the dealership’s thirteenth month of operations under our ownership and revenues are only included for identical months in the same-store base periods. Dealerships relocated within an existing market remain in the comparable dealership base for all periods. Additionally, amounts related to closed dealerships are excluded from each comparative base period. Because Dealership same-store sales may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense - other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and other (income) expense, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as the change in the fair value of warrant liability, change in fair value of contingent consideration, loss on extinguishment of debt and transaction costs. See “-Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for more information and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Summary of Acquisitions
The comparability of our results of operations between the periods discussed below is naturally affected by the acquisitions we have completed during such periods. We are also continuously evaluating and pursuing acquisitions on an ongoing basis, and such acquisitions, if completed, will continue to impact the comparability of our financial results. While we expect continued growth and strategic acquisitions in the future, our acquisitions may have materially different characteristics than our historical results, and such differences in economics may impact the comparability of our future results of operations to our historical results.

Fiscal Year 2020 Acquisitions
We did not complete any acquisitions in fiscal year 2020.
Other Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations
Our historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the reasons described below.
•
OneWater Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as a corporation. Our accounting predecessor, OneWater LLC, was and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, was and is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income is passed through to its members. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality. OneWater Inc.’s effective tax rates were 22.1%, 18.1% and 11.5% for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•
As we further implement controls, processes and infrastructure applicable to companies with publicly traded equity securities, it is likely that we will incur additional selling, general, and administrative expenses relative to historical periods. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our combined operations and execute our business strategy.
Results of Operations
Year Ended September 30, 2022, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021
Revenue
Overall, revenue increased by $516.6 million, or 42.1%, to $1,744.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $1,228.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Revenue generated from Dealership same-store sales increased 11.9% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of new boats, the number of pre-owned boats sold, the model mix of boats sold, an increase in finance & insurance sales and an increase in service, parts and other sales. We believe that COVID-19 has had a positive overall impact on the retail marine industry as people continue to seek recreational activities that could be done in a safe, socially distanced way. Overall revenue increased by $147.0 million as a result of our increase in Dealership same-store sales and $369.6 million from revenue from our Distribution segment as well as revenue not eligible for inclusion in the Dealership same-store sales base. New and acquired dealerships become eligible for inclusion in the comparable dealership base at the end of the dealership’s thirteenth month of operations under our ownership, and revenues are only included for identical months in the same-store base periods. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we completed 8 and 5 acquisitions, respectively.
New Boat Sales
New boat sales increased by $266.7 million, or 30.6%, to $1,139.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $872.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was the result of our Dealership same-store sales growth during the twelve-month period, our acquisitions and an increase in our average selling price. We believe the increase in sales was primarily due to continued execution of operational improvements on previously acquired dealers, the mix on boat brands and models sold, and product improvements in the functionality of technology which drove average unit prices higher.
Pre-owned Boat Sales
Pre-owned boat sales increased by $78.4 million, or 36.2%, to $294.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $216.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consigned and wholesale), which causes periodic and seasonal fluctuations in the average sales price. The increase in pre-owned boat sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of units sold which was driven by Dealership same-store sales growth and acquisition growth.
Finance & Insurance Income
We generate revenue from arranging finance & insurance products, including financing, insurance and extended warranty contracts, to customers through various third-party financial institutions and insurance companies. Finance & insurance income increased by $13.3 million, or 31.2%, to $56.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $42.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the additional new and pre-owned boat revenues. We remain very focused on improving sales of finance & insurance products throughout our dealer network and implementing best practices at acquired dealer groups and existing dealerships. Finance & insurance products decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue to 3.2% in the year ended September 30, 2022 from 3.5% for the year ended September 30, 2021. Finance & insurance income is recorded net of related fees, including fees charged back due to any early cancellation of loan or insurance contracts by a customer. Since finance & insurance income is fee-based, we do not incur any related cost of sale.
Service, Parts & Other Sales
Service, parts & other sales increased by $158.2 million, or 164.1%, to $254.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $96.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase in service, parts & other sales is primarily due to the contributions from our recently acquired parts and accessories businesses, including T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem, as well as increases across the board in labor, parts, fuel and storage sales, driven by ancillary sales generated from our increase in new and pre-owned boat sales at our dealerships.
Gross Profit
Overall, gross profit increased by $196.2 million, or 54.9%, to $553.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $357.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to our overall increase in Dealership same-store sales which was driven by increases in all revenue streams, the impact of the 2022 Acquisitions and the Company’s focus on dynamic pricing. Overall gross margins increased 260 basis points to 31.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022 from 29.1% for the year ended September 30, 2021 due to the factors noted below.
New Boat Gross Profit
New boat gross profit increased by $94.4 million, or 44.8%, to $305.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $210.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was due to our overall increase in Dealership same-store sales and acquired dealerships during fiscal year 2022. New boat gross profit as a percentage of new boat revenue was 26.8% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to 24.2% in the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in new boat gross profit and gross profit margin is due primarily to a shift in the mix and size of boat models sold, the margin profile of recently acquired locations, our emphasis on expanding new boat gross profit margins and the impact of industry wide inventory and supply chain constraints.
Pre-owned Boat Gross Profit
Pre-owned boat gross profit increased by $27.5 million, or 50.8%, to $81.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $54.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in pre-owned revenue as a result of our Dealership same-store sales and acquired dealerships during fiscal year 2022. Pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of pre-owned boat revenue was 27.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to 25.0% for the year ended September 30, 2021. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consignment and wholesale), which may cause periodic and seasonal fluctuations in pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, we experienced a strong increase in our gross profit on pre-owned sales for trade-ins, brokerage and consignment which all have a higher margin percentage than wholesale which saw a slight decrease in gross profit.
Finance & Insurance Gross Profit
Finance & insurance gross profit increased by $13.3 million, or 31.2%, to $56.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $42.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Finance & insurance income is fee-based revenue for which we do not recognize incremental cost of sales.
Service, Parts & Other Gross Profit
Service, parts & other gross profit increased by $61.0 million, or 122.6%, to $110.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $49.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of our acquisitions of parts and accessories businesses, including T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem, but was also further enhanced by our Dealership same-store sales growth. Service,
parts & other gross profit as a percentage of service, parts & other revenue was 43.5% and 51.6% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to a shift in the mix of revenue towards parts & accessories which has a lower gross profit percentage than service and other sales. Although the service, parts and other mix shifted and led to a year over year decrease in margin percentage, our parts and accessories gross profit percentage was still accretive to the overall company gross profit percentage of 31.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
Selling, general & administrative expenses increased by $103.1 million, or 51.8%, to $302.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $199.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to expenses incurred to support the overall increase in revenues and gross profit. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.3% from 16.2% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher variable personnel costs driven by the increased level of profitability for the year ended September 30, 2022 as well as increased costs given the current personnel environment.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $10.2 million, or 188.4%, to $15.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a $7.6 million increase in amortization of identifiable intangible assets, primarily attributable to the 2022 Acquisitions, as well as an increase in our property, plant and equipment.
Transaction Costs
The increase in transaction costs of $6.9 million, or 788.8%, to $7.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to expenses related to the 2022 Acquisitions.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
During the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred expenses of $10.4 million related to updated forecasts and accretion of contingent consideration liabilities related to fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions.
Income from Operations
Income from operations increased $69.0 million, or 46.3%, to $217.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $148.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the $196.2 million increase in gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, partially offset by a $103.1 million increase in selling, general & administrative expenses, a $10.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $6.9 million increase in transaction costs and a $7.1 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the same periods.
Interest Expense - Floor Plan
Interest expense - floor plan increased $2.1 million, or 81.1%, to $4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in floor plan interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in the average inventory for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 as well as an increase in interest rates.
Interest Expense - Other
Interest expense - other increased $8.9 million, or 203.9%, to $13.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our long term debt which was primarily used to fund certain 2022 Acquisitions.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred $0.4 million in debt extinguishment expenses related to the August 9, 2022 amendment of our term debt.
Other Expense (Income), Net
Other expense (income), net changed by $4.0 million to $3.8 million of expense for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $0.2 million of income for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the unrealized loss on our Forza X1, Inc. equity investment and expenses associated with Hurricane Ian.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense increased $17.4 million, or 67.5%, to $43.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $25.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the 37.7% increase in income before tax expense as well as the increased proportion of consolidated income before income tax expense that is allocated to OneWater Marine Inc. and therefore taxable due to the exchanges of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income increased by $36.2 million to $152.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $116.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the same periods.
Results of Operations
Year Ended September 30, 2021, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2020
Revenue
Overall, revenue increased by $205.2 million, or 20.1%, to $1,228.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $1,023.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Revenue generated from Dealership same-store sales increased 9.7% for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of new and pre-owned boats, the model mix of boats sold, an increase in finance & insurance sales and an increase in service, parts and other sales. We believe that COVID-19 has had a positive overall impact on the retail marine industry as people continue to seek recreational activities that could be done in a safe socially distanced way. Overall revenue increased by $99.3 million as a result of our increase in Dealership same-store sales and $105.9 million from dealerships not eligible for inclusion in the same-store sales base. New and acquired dealerships become eligible for inclusion in the comparable dealership base at the end of the dealership’s thirteenth month of operations under our ownership, and revenues are only included for identical months in the same-store base periods. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we completed 5 acquisitions. We did not make any acquisitions in the year ended September 30, 2020.
New Boat Sales
New boat sales increased by $155.6 million, or 21.7%, to $872.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $717.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was the result of our Dealership same-store sales growth during the twelve-month period, the increased unit sales attributable to the 2021 Acquisitions and an increase in our average unit price. We believe the increase in sales was primarily due to the shift towards outdoor leisure activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as, the continued execution of operational improvements on previously acquired dealers. The increase in average sales price was due to consumer demand, the mix of boat brands and models sold, and product improvements in the functionality and technology of boats.
Pre-owned Boat Sales
Pre-owned boat sales increased by $10.8 million, or 5.2%, to $216.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $205.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consigned and wholesale), which causes periodic and seasonal fluctuations in the average sales price. Pre-owned boat sales for the year ended September 30, 2021 experienced a decrease in the number of units sold due to industry-wide supply constraints. The average sales price per pre-owned unit in the year ended September 30, 2021 increased largely due to the mix of pre-owned products and the composition of the brands and models sold during the period as well as the industry-wide supply restrictions and higher prices.
Finance & Insurance Income
We generate revenue from arranging finance & insurance products, including financing, insurance and extended warranty contracts, to customers through various third-party financial institutions and insurance companies. Finance & insurance income increased by $5.9 million, or 16.0%, to $42.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $36.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily a result of the increase in Dealership same-store sales, process improvements and additional revenue attributable to the 2021 Acquisitions. We remain very focused on improving sales of finance & insurance products throughout our dealer network and implementing best practices at acquired dealer groups and existing dealerships. Finance & insurance products decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue to 3.5% in the year ended September 30, 2021 from 3.6% for the year ended September 30, 2020. Finance & insurance income is recorded net of related fees, including fees charged back due to any early cancellation of loan or insurance contracts by a customer. Since finance & insurance income is fee-based, we do not incur any related cost of sale.
Service, Parts & Other Sales
Service, parts & other sales increased by $33.0 million, or 52.0%, to $96.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $63.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase in service, parts & other sales is primarily due to increases across the board in labor, parts, fuel and storage sales, driven by ancillary sales generated from our increase in new and pre-owned boat sales and the impact of our 2021 Acquisitions.
Gross Profit
Overall, gross profit increased by $121.9 million, or 51.8%, to $357.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $235.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to our overall increase in Dealership same-store sales, primarily driven by an increase in new boat sales, as well as higher pre-owned boat sales, finance & insurance income and service, parts and other sales. The increase in gross profit was also a result of an increase in the number of locations due to the 2021 Acquisitions. Overall gross margins increased 610 basis points to 29.1% for the year ended September 30, 2021 from 23.0% for the year ended September 30, 2020 due to the factors noted below.
New Boat Gross Profit
New boat gross profit increased by $79.5 million, or 60.5%, to $210.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $131.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase was due to our overall increase in Dealership same-store sales and acquired dealerships during fiscal year 2021. New boat gross profit as a percentage of new boat revenue was 24.2% for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to 18.3% in the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in new boat gross profit and gross profit margin is due primarily to a shift in the mix and size of boat models sold, the margin profile of recently acquired locations and our emphasis on expanding new boat gross profit margins.
Pre-owned Boat Gross Profit
Pre-owned boat gross profit increased by $16.7 million, or 44.8%, to $54.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $37.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in our Dealership same-store sales and acquired dealerships during fiscal year 2021. Pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of pre-owned boat revenue was 25.0% for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to 18.2% in the year ended September 30, 2020. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consignment and wholesale), which may cause periodic and seasonal fluctuations in pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of revenue. In the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, we experienced an increase in our gross profit on pre-owned sales for each of the different sales arrangements.
Finance & Insurance Gross Profit
Finance & insurance gross profit increased by $5.9 million, or 16.0%, to $42.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $36.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Finance & insurance income is fee-based revenue for which we do not recognize incremental expense.
Service, Parts & Other Gross Profit
Service, parts & other gross profit increased by $19.8 million, or 65.9%, to $49.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $30.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Service, parts & other gross profit as a percentage of service, parts & other revenue was 51.6% and 47.2% for the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase was the result of the mix of products sold, which shifted towards service work, which has a higher margin. Additionally, due to the increased demand, we experienced an increase in the overall productivity of our service technicians, which also drove margins higher.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
Selling, general & administrative expenses increased by $55.5 million, or 38.6%, to $199.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $143.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 This increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and expenses incurred to support the overall increase in Dealership same-store sales. The increase in selling, general & administrative expenses primarily consisted of a $45.0 million increase in personnel expenses, a $5.9 million increase in administrative expenses and a $5.1 million increase in fixed expenses. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 16.2% from 14.0% for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher variable-based compensation expense as a result of the Company’s increased net profit margin.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million, or 66.5%, to $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $3.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in property and equipment from our 2021 Acquisitions.
Transaction Costs
The decrease in transaction costs of $2.8 million, or 76.2%, to $0.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $3.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to expenses recognized in conjunction with the IPO and the public offering on September 22, 2020 (the “September Offering”) that were not able to be capitalized for the year ended September 30, 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we increased our contingent consideration related to a fiscal 2021 acquisition in the amount of $3.2 million. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we increased our contingent consideration related to a fiscal 2019 acquisition in the amount of $6.8 million.
Income from Operations
Income from operations increased $70.6 million, or 90.2%, to $148.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $78.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the $121.9 million increase in gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, partially offset by a $55.5 million increase in selling, general & administrative expenses during the same period.
Interest Expense - Floor Plan
Interest expense - floor plan decreased $6.3 million, or 71.0%, to $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $8.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average outstanding borrowings on our Inventory Financing Facility for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, falling interest rates, and interest assistance received from our manufacturers and banks.
Interest Expense - Other
The decrease in interest expense - other of $4.5 million, or 50.8%, to $4.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to the payoff of our Term and Revolver Credit Facility with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (the “Term and Revolver Credit Facility”) and entry into the Credit Facility (as defined below), which offers a more favorable interest rate.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
The change in fair value of warrant liability of $0.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 was attributable to an overall change in the enterprise value of the Company. No charge was recorded for the year ended September 30, 2021 as the warrants were exercised in conjunction with the IPO.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended September 30, 2020, we incurred $6.6 million in debt extinguishment expenses. On July 22, 2020 in connection with the refinancing of our term debt, we repaid in full the Term and Revolver Credit Facility. As part of the pre-payment of the Term and Revolver Credit Facility, we were required to pay an early termination fee of $4.2 million. Additionally, in connection with the debt extinguishment, we recognized $2.4 million of expense for unamortized debt issuance costs.
Other (Income) Expense, Net
Other income, net was approximately $248,000 and $24,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended September 30, 2020, respectively.
Income Tax Expense
The $19.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily the result of the $87.4 million increase in income before income tax expense and the IPO and the taxability of OneWater Inc. as a corporation for the full year ended September 30, 2021 versus only the period subsequent to the IPO for the year ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, as Class B common stock was exchanged for Class A common stock (in accordance with the terms of the OneWater LLC Agreement), the proportion of consolidated income before income tax expense allocated to OneWater Inc. increased, yielding higher income tax expense.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income increased by $67.9 million to $116.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $48.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the $121.9 million increase in gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to September 30, 2020. The increase was partially offset by a $55.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, as well as a $19.5 million increase in income tax expense for the same period.
Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure
We view Adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense - other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and other (income) expense, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as the change in the fair value of warrant liability, change in fair value of contingent consideration, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and transaction costs.
Our board of directors, management team and lenders use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and other items (such as the fair value adjustment of the warrants, change in fair value of contingent consideration, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and transaction costs) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented.
Year Ended September 30, 2022, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA was $247.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $155.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA resulted from our 11.9% increase in Dealership same-store sales growth for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, combined with the results of the 2022 Acquisitions and our ability to increase gross profit margins and control selling, general and administrative expenses.
Year Ended September 30, 2021, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $155.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $83.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA resulted from our 9.7% increase in Dealership same-store sales growth for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, combined with the results of the 2021 Acquisitions and our ability to increase gross profit margins and the impact of the adjusting items noted above.
Seasonality
Our business, along with the entire boating industry, is highly seasonal, and such seasonality varies by geographic market. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories, and related floor plan borrowings, in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. Revenue generated from our dealerships in Florida serves to offset generally lower winter revenue in our other states and enables us to maintain a more consistent revenue stream. The onset of the public boat and recreation shows in January stimulates boat sales and typically allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related floor plan borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. The impact of seasonality on our results of operations could be materially impacted based on the location of our acquisitions. For example, our operations could be substantially more seasonal if we acquire dealer groups that operate in colder regions of the United States. Our business is also subject to weather patterns, which may adversely affect our results of operations. For example, prolonged winter conditions, reduced rainfall levels or excessive rain, may limit access to boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products and services. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations. Hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities, as has been the case when Florida and other markets were affected by hurricanes. We believe our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area. Additionally, due to a global pandemic, our seasonal trends may also change as a result of, among other things, location closures, disruptions to the supply chain and inventory availability, manufacturer delays, and cancellation of boat shows. For more information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Industry and Competition-Our business, as well as the entire retail marine industry, is highly seasonal, with seasonality varying in different geographic markets” and “Business-Seasonality.”
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
OneWater Inc. is a holding company with no operations and is the sole managing member of OneWater LLC. OneWater Inc’s principal asset consists of common units of OneWater LLC. Our earnings and cash flows and ability to meet our obligations under the A&R Credit Facility, and any other debt obligations will depend on the cash flows resulting from the operations of our operating subsidiaries, and the payment of distributions by such subsidiaries. Our A&R Credit Facility and Inventory Financing Facility (described below) contain certain restrictions on distributions or transfers from our operating subsidiaries to their members or unitholders, as applicable, as described in the summaries below under “-Debt Agreements-A&R Credit Facility” and “-Inventory Financing Facility.” Accordingly, the operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. As a result, our ability to make payments under the A&R Credit Facility and any other debt obligations or to declare dividends could be limited.
Our cash needs are primarily for growth through acquisitions and working capital to support our operations, including new and pre-owned boat and related parts inventories and off-season liquidity. We routinely monitor our cash flow to determine the amount of cash available to complete acquisitions. We monitor our inventories, inventory aging and current market trends to determine our current and future inventory and related floorplan financing needs. Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe we will have adequate cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and proceeds from any future public or private issuances of debt or equity to fund our current operations, to make share repurchases and to fund essential capital expenditures and acquisitions for the next twelve months and beyond.
Cash needs for acquisitions have historically been financed with our Credit Facilities and cash generated from operations. Our ability to utilize the A&R Credit Facility to fund acquisitions depend upon Adjusted EBITDA and compliance with covenants of the A&R Credit Facility. Cash needs for inventory have historically been financed with our Inventory Financing Facility. Our ability to fund inventory purchases and operations depends on the collateral levels and our compliance with the covenants of the Inventory Financing Facility. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the A&R Credit Facility and the Inventory Financing Facility.

On March 30, 2022, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $50 million of outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made at any time or from time to time, without prior notice, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices, or such other means as will comply with applicable state and federal securities laws and regulations, including the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including Rule 10b5-1 and, to the extent practicable or advisable, Rule 10b-18 thereunder, and consistent with the Company’s contractual limitations and other requirements. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company repurchased 10,134 shares at an average price of $34.89 per share. The Company has $49.6 million remaining under the share repurchase program.
The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August 2022, imposes a 1%, non-deductible excise tax on certain repurchases of common stock that occur after December 31, 2022. We expect the excise tax to apply to our share repurchase program, but do not expect the tax to have a material effect on our business.
Debt Agreements
Credit Facility
Effective July 22, 2020, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Credit Agreement (as amended by the First Incremental Amendment and the Second Incremental Amendment and as further amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with Truist Bank and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Facility provided for (i) a $50.0 million revolving credit facility that was used for revolving credit loans (including up to $5.0 million in swingline loans and up to $5.0 million in letters of credit from time to time), and (ii) a term loan facility (which includes incremental term loans as provided in the First Incremental Amendment (as defined below) and Second Incremental Amendment (as defined below)). Subject to certain conditions, the available amount under the revolving credit facility and the term loans may be increased. The revolving credit facility was scheduled to mature on July 22, 2025. The term loan was repayable in installments beginning on March 31, 2021, with the remainder due on the earlier of (i) July 22, 2025 or (ii) the date on which the principal amount of all outstanding term loans have been declared or automatically have become due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility.
On February 2, 2021, we entered into the Incremental Amendment No. 1 (the “First Incremental Amendment”) to the Credit Facility to provide for, among other things, an incremental term loan to OWAO in an aggregate principal amount equal to $30.0 million, which was added to, and constituted a part of, the existing $80.0 million term loan.
On November 30, 2021, we entered into the Incremental Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Incremental Amendment”) to the Credit Facility to provide for, among other things, an incremental term loan to OWAO in an aggregate principal amount equal to $200.0 million, which was added to, and constituted a part of, the existing $110.0 million term loan. The Second Incremental Amendment further provided for a $20.0 million increase in the existing revolving commitment, which was added to, and constituted a part of, the existing $30.0 million revolving commitment.
A&R Credit Facility
On August 9, 2022 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “A&R Credit Facility”), with certain of our subsidiaries, Truist Bank and the other lenders party thereto. The A&R Credit Facility amends and restates and replaces in its entirety the Credit Facility. The A&R Credit Facility provides for, among other things, (i) a $65.0 million revolving credit facility (including up to $5.0 million in swingline loans and up to $5.0 million in letters of credit from time to time) and (ii) a $445.0 million term loan facility. Subject to certain conditions, the available amount under the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility may be increased by $125.0 million plus additional amounts subject to additional conditions (including satisfaction of a consolidated leverage ratio requirement) in the aggregate (with up to $50.0 million allocable to the Revolving Facility). The Revolving Facility matures on August 9, 2027. The Term Facility is repayable in installments beginning on December 31, 2022, with the remainder due on the earlier of (i) August 9, 2027 or (ii) the date on which the principal amount of all outstanding term loans have been declared or automatically have become due and payable pursuant to the terms of the A&R Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the A&R Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) a base rate (the “Base Rate”) equal to the highest of (i) the prime rate (as announced by Truist Bank from time to time), (ii) the Federal Funds Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus 0.50%, (iii) Term SOFR (as defined in the A&R Credit Facility) for a one-month Interest Period (calculated on a daily basis after taking into account a floor equal to 0.00%) plus 1.00%, and (iv) 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75%, or (b) Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75%. Interest on swingline loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%. All applicable interest margins are based on certain consolidated leverage ratio measures.
The A&R Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants including the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The A&R Credit Facility also contains non-financial covenants and restrictive provisions that, among other things, limit the ability of the Loan Parties (as defined in the A&R Credit Facility) to incur additional debt, transfer or dispose of all of their respective assets, make certain investments, loans or restricted payments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The A&R Credit Facility also includes events of default, borrowing conditions, representations and warranties and provisions regarding indemnification and expense reimbursement. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2022.
Inventory Financing Facility
On December 29, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Seventh Amended and Restated Inventory Financing Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Inventory Financing Facility”) to, among other things, increase the maximum borrowing amount available to $500.0 million. Loans under the Inventory Financing Facility may be extended from time to time to enable the Company to purchase inventory from certain manufacturers. The Inventory Financing Facility Expires on December 1, 2023.
On February 24, 2022, April 1, 2022 and August 9, 2022, the Company entered into the First, Second and Third Amendments to the Inventory Financing Facility, respectively, to join various subsidiaries of the Company to the Inventory Financing Facility in connection with certain acquisitions made by the Company, in each case, as permitted by and under the Inventory Financing Facility. Additionally, the Third Amendment to the Inventory Financing Facility increased the Funded Debt to EBIDTA Ratio (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility). No other terms of the Inventory Financing Facility were changed with the amendments.
Interest on new boats and for rental units is calculated using the Adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 5.00% depending on the age of the inventory. Interest on pre-owned boats is calculated at the new boat rate plus 0.25%. Loans are extended from time to time to enable us to purchase inventory from certain manufacturers and to lease certain boats and related parts to customers. The applicable financial terms, curtailment schedule and maturity for each loan are set forth in separate program terms letters that were entered into from time to time. The collateral for the Inventory Financing Facility consisted primarily of our inventory that was financed through the Inventory Financing Facility and related assets, including accounts receivable, bank accounts, and proceeds of the foregoing, and excludes the collateral that secures the A&R Credit Facility.
We are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Inventory Financing Facility, including certain provisions related to the Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio, and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility). We are also subject to additional restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to (i) use, sell, rent or otherwise dispose of any collateral securing the Inventory Financing Facility except for the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business, (ii) incur certain liens, (iii) engage in any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business, (iv) change our business in any material manner or our organizational structure, other than as otherwise provided for in the Inventory Financing Facility, (v) engage in certain mergers or consolidations, (vi) acquire certain assets or ownership interests of any other person or entities, except for certain permitted acquisitions, (vii) guarantee or indemnify or otherwise become in any way liable with respect to certain obligations of any other person or entity, except as provided by the Inventory Financing Facility, (viii) redeem, retire, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the equity of our acquired marine retailers (ix) make any change in any of our marine retailers’ capital structure or in any of their business objectives or operations which might in any way adversely affect the ability of such marine retailer to repay its obligations under the Inventory Financing Facility, (x) incur, create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become or remain liable with respect to certain indebtedness, and (xi) make certain payments of subordinated debt. OneWater LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted from, among other things, making cash dividends or distributions without the prior written consent of Wells Fargo. Under the Inventory Financing Facility, among other exceptions, OneWater LLC may make distributions to its members for certain permitted tax payments subject to certain financial ratios, may make scheduled payments on certain subordinated debt and is permitted to make pro rata distributions to the OneWater Unit Holders, including OneWater Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow OneWater Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. OneWater LLC’s subsidiaries are generally restricted from making loans or advances to OneWater LLC. Our Chief Executive Officer, Philip Austin Singleton, Jr., and our Chief Operating Officer, Anthony Aisquith, provide certain personal guarantees of the Inventory Financing Facility.
On June 16, 2021, OneWater Inc. and OneWater LLC obtained a written consent from the Agent (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility) to permit the payment of the one-time special cash dividend of $1.80 per share on June 17, 2021.
As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, our indebtedness associated with financing our inventory under the Inventory Financing Facility totaled $267.1 million and $114.2 million, respectively. Certain of our manufacturers enter into independent agreements with the lenders to the Inventory Financing Facility, which results in a lower effective interest rate charged to us for borrowings related to the products by such manufacturer. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the effective interest rate on the outstanding short-term borrowings under the Inventory Financing Facility was 2.2% and 2.0%, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, our additional available borrowings under our Inventory Financing Facility were $232.9 million and $278.3 million, respectively, based upon the outstanding borrowings and the maximum facility amount. The aging of our inventory limits our borrowing capacity as defined curtailments reduce the allowable advance rate as our inventory ages. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Inventory Financing Facility.
Notes Payable
Acquisition Notes Payable. In connection with certain of our acquisitions of dealer groups, we have entered into notes payable agreements with the acquired entities to finance these acquisitions. As of September 30, 2022, our indebtedness associated with our 2 acquisition notes payable totaled an aggregate of $3.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.0% per annum. As of September 30, 2022, the principal amount outstanding under these acquisition notes payable ranged from $1.1 million to $2.1 million, and the maturity dates ranged from December 1, 2023 to December 1, 2024.
Commercial Vehicles Notes Payable. Since 2015, we have entered into multiple notes payable with various commercial lenders in connection with our acquisition of certain vehicles utilized in our retail operations. Such notes bear interest ranging from 0.0% to 8.9% per annum, require monthly payments of approximately $145,000, and mature on dates between November 2022 to October 2028. As of September 30, 2022, we had $4.2 million outstanding under the commercial vehicles notes payable.
Contractual Obligations
The table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are contractually obligated to make based on agreements in place at September 30, 2022.
(1)
Payments are generally made as required pursuant to the A&R Credit Facility discussed above under “-Debt Agreements-A&R Credit Facility.”
(2)
Payments are generally made as required pursuant to the Inventory Financing Facility discussed above under “-Debt Agreements-Inventory Financing Facility.” Amounts do not include estimated interest payments.
(3)
Includes notes payable entered into in connection with certain of our acquisitions of dealer groups and notes payable entered into with various commercial lenders in connection with our acquisition of certain vehicles. Payments are generally made as required pursuant to the terms of the relevant notes payable and as discussed above under “-Debt Agreements-Notes Payable.”
(4)
Estimated interest payments based on the outstanding principal and stated interest rates on the A&R Credit Facility and Notes Payable.
(5)
Includes certain physical facilities and equipment that we lease under noncancelable operating leases.
Tax Receivable Agreement
The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by OneWater Inc. to certain of the OneWater Unit Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using the estimated impact of state and local taxes) that OneWater Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the IPO as a result of certain tax basis increases and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. OneWater Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings. To the extent OneWater LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt or other agreements, the OneWater LLC Agreement will require OneWater LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to OneWater Unit Holders, including OneWater Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow OneWater Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We generally expect OneWater LLC to fund such distributions out of available cash. However, except in cases where OneWater Inc. elects to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control or OneWater Inc. has available cash but fails to make payments when due, generally OneWater Inc. may elect to defer payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement if it does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if its contractual obligations limit its ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will accrue interest. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, OneWater Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In the case of such an acceleration, where applicable, we generally expect the accelerated payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement to be funded out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration. OneWater Inc. intends to account for any amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases and purchase commitments under supply agreements entered into in the normal course of business.
