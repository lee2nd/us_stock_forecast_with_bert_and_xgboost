Overview
Landec Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Landec”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) design, develop, manufacture, and sell differentiated products for food and biomaterials markets, and license technology applications to partners. Landec has three reportable business segments - Lifecore, Curation Foods, and Other which are described below. Landec’s biomedical company, Lifecore Biomedical®, is a fully integrated contract development and manufacturing organization ("CDMO") that offers highly differentiated capabilities in the development, fill and finish of sterile, injectable pharmaceutical products in syringes and vials. As a leading manufacturer of premium, injectable grade Hyaluronic Acid, Lifecore brings 37 years of expertise as a partner for global and emerging biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across multiple therapeutic categories to bring their innovations to market.
Landec’s natural food company, Curation Foods, Inc. (“Curation Foods”) is focused on innovating and distributing plant-based foods with 100% clean ingredients to retail, club and foodservice channels throughout North America.
Included in the Other segment is Corporate, which includes corporate general and administrative expenses, non-Lifecore and non-Curation Food interest income, interest expense, and income tax expenses.
Strategy
The Company’s strategy is to maximize the value of our business portfolio by investing in growth to drive momentum at Lifecore while driving profitable growth across the organization with consumer insights driven innovation. Each of our business segments are in different life stages and have clear strategic priorities.
On August 10, 2022, Landec formally announced that we will become a CDMO-focused life sciences company with a planned corporate rebranding including renaming the Company to Lifecore Biomedical and exploring potential sales opportunities of the Company’s remaining Curation Foods assets.
Lifecore
Lifecore is the Company’s FDA-approved CDMO business, which is focused on driving profitable growth with product development and manufacturing of sterile injectable products. Lifecore seeks to expand its presence in the CDMO marketplace by partnering with biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to bring their unique therapies to market. Lifecore’s goal of continuing success will be to execute on its three strategic priorities:
1) Managing Business Development Pipeline: Accelerate product development activities for small and large biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in various stages of the product lifecycle, spanning clinical development stage to commercialization, which aligns with the business’ overall product development strategy.
2) Maximizing Capacity: Meet customer demand by maximizing capacity in the syringe and vial multi-purpose filler production line to significantly increase the number of products produced.
3) Advancing Product Commercialization: Continue to seek out opportunities to advance customers’ late-stage product development activities by supporting their clinical programs and commercial process scale-up activities.
Curation Foods
Curation Foods, the Company’s natural food business, is focused on transforming its business to improve operational performance. The Company launched Project SWIFT which aims to strengthen Curation Foods by simplifying the business. The Company believes that the decisive actions of Project SWIFT will help improve the Company’s operating cost structure, enhance profitability, and strengthen its balance sheet with an overall aim to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Curation Foods intends to continue to deliver high levels of product quality and safety, while successfully executing on its customer and partner commitments. Project SWIFT will continue to be implemented throughout fiscal 2023, with three strategic priorities designed to improve Curation Foods’ overall financial performance and profitability:
1) Network & Operational Optimization: Streamline the organization to maximize efficiency and productivity by continuous improvement in plant operations with lean manufacturing practices. This included the consolidation and centralization of Curation Foods various offices into its Innovation Center headquarters in Santa Maria, California in fiscal 2020.
2) Focus on Strategic Assets: Simplify the business by divesting non-core assets. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company sold its interest in the Ontario, California salad dressing manufacturing facility for net proceeds of $4.9 million. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company sold the underutilized Hanover manufacturing facility building and assets related thereto for net proceeds of $8.0 million. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company sold Curation Foods’ Eat Smart business, including its salad and cut vegetable businesses for a purchase price of $73.5 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments based upon net working capital at the Closing Date. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2020, on June 2, 2022, the Company and Curation Foods entered into and closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Hazel Technologies, Inc. (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which Curation Foods sold all of its assets related to BreatheWay packaging technology business to the Purchasers in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $3.2 million.
3) Organizational Redesign: Redesigning the organization so that it is the appropriate size for the Company’s future direction. In fiscal 2021 through 2022, the Company focused on redesigning strategic initiatives, developed and elevated internal talent and reduced overall headcount to improve efficiencies.
The COVID-19 Pandemic
There are many uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the scope of scientific and health issues, the anticipated duration of the pandemic, and the extent of local and worldwide social, political, and economic disruption it may cause. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and we believe will continue to have significant adverse impacts on many aspects of the Company’s operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to sales, customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, the Company’s employees, and the market generally, and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and intends to continue to make adjustments to its responses accordingly.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting estimates that require management’s most significant and subjective judgments include revenue recognition; loss contingencies, sales returns and credit losses; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and inventory; the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation.
These estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments. The analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. The actual results may differ from management’s estimates. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 - Organization, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with our Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows the five step, principles-based model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue, net of estimated allowances and returns, is recognized when or as the Company satisfies its performance obligations under a contract and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Lifecore
Lifecore generates revenue from two integrated activities: CDMO and Fermentation. CDMO is comprised of aseptic and development services. Lifecore’s standard terms of sale are generally included in its contracts and purchase orders. Shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are recorded in both revenue and cost of goods sold. Lifecore has elected to account for shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, and not as a separate performance obligation. Lifecore’s standard payment terms with its customers generally range from 30 days to 60 days.
Aseptic
Lifecore provides aseptic formulation and filling of syringes and vials with precisely formulated medical grade HA and non-HA materials for injectable products used for medical purposes. In instances where our customers contract with us to aseptically fill syringes or vials with our HA, the goods are not distinct in the context of the contract. Lifecore recognizes revenue for these products at the point in time when legal title to the product is transferred to the customer, which is at the time that shipment is made or upon delivery of the product.
Development Services
Lifecore provides product development services to assist its customers in obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of their drug product. These services include activities such as technology development, material component changes, analytical method development, formulation development, pilot studies, stability studies, process validation and production of materials for use within clinical studies. The Company’s customers benefit from the expertise of its scientists who have extensive experience performing such tasks.
Each of the promised goods and services are not distinct in the context of the contract as the goods and services are highly interdependent and interrelated. The services described above are significantly affected by each other because Lifecore would not be able to fulfill its promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently.
Revenues generated from development services arrangements are recognized over time as Lifecore is creating an asset without an alternate use as it is unique to the customer. Furthermore, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date for its costs incurred in satisfying the performance obligation plus a reasonable profit margin. For each of the development activities performed by Lifecore as described above, labor is the primary input (i.e., labor costs represent the majority of the costs incurred in the completion of the services). The Company determined that labor hours are the best measure of progress as it most accurately depicts the effort extended to satisfy the performance obligation over time.
Fermentation
Lifecore manufactures and sells pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate (“HA”) in bulk form to its customers. The HA produced is distinct as customers are able to utilize the product provided under HA supply contracts when they obtain control. Lifecore recognizes revenue for these products at the point in time when legal title to the product is transferred to the customer, which is at the time that shipment is made or upon delivery of the product to our customer.
Curation Foods
Curation Foods’ standard terms of sale, both prior to and following the Eat Smart Disposition, are generally included in its contracts and purchase orders. Revenue is recognized at the time shipment is made or upon delivery as control of the product is transferred to the customer. Shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are recorded in both revenue and cost of goods sold. Curation Foods has elected to account for shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, and not as a separate performance obligation. Curation Foods’ standard payment terms with its customers generally range from 30 days to 90 days. Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives (including: volume rebates, discounts, and promotions), which are accounted for as variable consideration to Curation Foods’ performance obligations. Curation Foods estimates these sales incentives based on the expected amount to be provided to its customers and reduces revenues recognized towards its performance obligations. The Company has not historically had and does not anticipate significant changes in its estimates for variable consideration.
Impairment Review of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset
The Company tests its goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives annually for impairment in the fiscal fourth quarter or earlier if there are indications during a different interim period that these assets may have become impaired.
On a quarterly basis, the Company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, based on management’s assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation. Such changes, if significant or material, could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets during the current period. The results of these tests could lead to write-downs of the carrying values of these assets in the current period.
With respect to goodwill, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market environment, cost factors, overall financial performance of the Company, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization, litigation, and stock price. If the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment of a reporting unit, a quantitative test is performed. The quantitative test compares the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill to its fair value. The Company determines the fair value using an income approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the Company and the rate of return an outside investor could expect to earn. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
To determine the fair value of a reporting unit as part of its quantitative test, the Company uses a discounted cash flow ("DCF") method under the income approach, as it believes that this approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair value of its businesses and the fair value of their future earnings and cash flows. Under this approach, which requires significant judgments, the Company estimates the future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects their relative risk. The cash flows used in the DCF method are consistent with those the Company uses in its internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced, and the broader business strategy for the long term. The other key estimates and factors used in the DCF method include, but are not limited to, future volumes, net sales and expense growth
rates, gross margin and gross margin growth rates, and the discount rate applied. Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce different results.
For trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market environment, cost factors, overall financial performance of the Company, litigation, and changes in the business in its annual, qualitative analysis to test for impairment. If the results of a qualitative test indicate a potential for impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite life, a quantitative test is performed. The quantitative test compares the estimated fair value of an asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of such asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. The Company uses the income approach to estimate the fair value of its trademarks. This approach requires significant judgments in determining the royalty rates and the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. Changes in such estimates or the use of alternative assumptions could produce different results.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million and $3.5 million related to its O and Yucatan Foods trademarks, respectively. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $5.2 million and $2.7 million related to its O and Yucatan Foods goodwill, respectively. The O impairment charges were primarily a result of the recently updated (lowered) financial outlook for the O reporting unit, related to a recent shift in strategic focus within the Curation Foods business segment. The Yucatan Foods impairment charges were primarily a result of an increase in the Yucatan Foods carrying value and an increase in the discount rate, as a result of uncertainty in forecasting the effects of COVID-19 and general economic uncertainties. These impairment charges are included in the line item “impairment of goodwill and intangible assets” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and both are in the Curation Foods business segment.
During fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges of $32.1 million and $20.0 million related to its Eat Smart business and Yucatan Foods goodwill, respectively. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $8.7 million related to its Yucatan Foods trademarks. These impairment charges were primarily a result of an indication of a decrease in the fair market values of our Eat Smart and Yucatan Foods businesses driven by lower market valuations and a decrease in projected cash flows. The goodwill impairment charge related to the Eat Smart business goodwill is included in “loss from discontinued operations” within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Yucatan Foods related impairment charges are included in the line item “impairment of goodwill and intangible assets” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are in the Curation Foods business segment.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company’s income tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
In addition to valuation allowances, the Company establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions. The tax-contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company’s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax-contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management.
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has accrued, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes its tax-contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. The Company’s tax-contingency accruals are recorded in Other accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Results of Operations
Revenues:
Lifecore generates revenues from the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate (“HA”) products and providing contract development and aseptic manufacturing services to customers. Lifecore generates revenues from two integrated activities: (1) CDMO and (2) fermentation.
Curation Foods revenues for the periods presented consist of revenues generated from sales of (1) Yucatan, Cabo Fresh, and private label branded guacamole and avocado products, (2) O olive oils and wine vinegars, and (3) BreatheWay packaging to license partners. As a result of the Eat Smart Disposition, the Company met the requirements of ASC 205-20, to report the results of the Eat Smart business as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the operating results for the Eat Smart business have therefore been reclassified as a discontinued operations for the periods presented.
Lifecore
The increase in Lifecore’s revenues for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an $11.0 million increase in CDMO revenues from an increase in development services activities resulting in higher sales to new and existing customers and an increase in aseptic commercial shipments, resulting from increased demand from existing customers, as well as a $0.2 million increase in fermentation sales due to higher sales to existing customers.
The increase in Lifecore’s revenues for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a $10.5 million increase in CDMO revenues resulting from increased demand from existing customers that drove an increase in aseptic filling commercial shipments, and a $1.7 million increase in fermentation sales due to higher sales to existing customers.
Curation Foods
The increase in Curation Foods’ revenues for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased volume of sales of our guacamole and avocado products and olive oil and wine vinegars.
The decrease in Curation Foods’ revenues for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in our technology revenue primarily due to a $1.6 million nonrecurring royalty transaction in fiscal year 2020, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our Avocado Products driven by an increase in volume of sales of our guacamole and avocado products.
Gross Profit:
There are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sales discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few. Many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors. The Company includes in cost of sales all of the following costs: raw materials (including packaging, syringes, fermentation and purification supplies), direct labor, overhead (including indirect labor, depreciation, and facility-related costs), and shipping and shipping-related costs.
Lifecore
The increase in Lifecore’s gross profit for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an 11% increase in revenues, as well as a favorable product mix change in fiscal year 2022. As a result, Lifecore’s gross margin increased to 40.0% in fiscal year 2022 from 39.0% in fiscal year 2021.
The increase in Lifecore’s gross profit for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a 14% increase in revenues, as well as a favorable product mix change in fiscal year 2021. As a result, Lifecore’s gross margin increased to 39.0% in fiscal year 2021 from 38.3% in fiscal year 2020.
Curation Foods
The decrease in gross profit for the Curation Foods business for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased freight costs combined with increased raw product sourcing costs.
The increase in gross profit for the Curation Foods business for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to an increase in gross profits from avocado products driven by the sale of products in fiscal 2021 produced with lower cost avocados than those used for products sold in fiscal 2020.
Operating Expenses:
Research and Development (R&D)
R&D expenses consist primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives. R&D expenses in our Lifecore business are focused on new products and applications for HA-based and non-HA biomaterials. In the Curation Foods business R&D expenses are primarily focused on innovating our current product lines and on the Company’s proprietary BreatheWay membranes used for packaging produce, with a focus on extending the shelf-life of sensitive vegetables and fruit. For Other, the R&D expenses are primarily focused on creating and developing new innovative lines of products.
The increase in R&D expenses for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due an increase in Lifecore’s R&D expenses primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses, including increased headcount, partially offset but a decrease in Curation Foods R&D expenses due to a decrease in R&D activities.
The decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due a decrease in Curation Foods and Other R&D expenses due to a decrease in R&D activities in these segments, partially offset by an increase in Lifecore’s R&D expenses primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses, including increased headcount.
Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A")
SG&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec’s product sales and services, business development expenses, and staff and administrative expenses.
The increase in SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $8.8 million increase in the Curation Foods segment driven by costs incurred related to the transition services agreement for the Eat Smart Disposition, and a $1.7 million increase at Lifecore due to increased salary and benefit expenses, including increased headcount. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in the Other segment driven by a decrease in legal costs.
The decrease in SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to cost cutting and restructuring efforts in our Curation Foods segment associated with Project SWIFT. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million increase at Lifecore due to increased salary and benefit expenses, including increased headcount.
Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible assets, Legal Settlement Charge, and Restructuring Costs
During fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $20.0 million related to its Yucatan Foods goodwill. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $8.7 million related to its Yucatan Foods trademarks. These impairment charges were primarily a result of an indication of a decrease in the fair market values of our Yucatan Foods businesses driven by lower market valuations and a decrease in projected cash flows. The Yucatan Foods related impairment charges are included in the line item “impairment of goodwill and intangible assets” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are in the Curation Foods business segment. Refer to Note 1 - Impairment Review of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million and $3.5 million related to its O and Yucatan Foods trademarks, respectively. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $5.2 million and $2.7 million related to its O and Yucatan Foods goodwill, respectively. The O impairment charges were primarily a result of the recently updated (lowered) financial outlook for the O reporting unit, related to a recent shift in strategic focus within the Curation Foods business segment. The Yucatan Foods impairment charges were primarily a result of an increase in the Yucatan Foods carrying value and an increase in the discount rate, as a result of uncertainty in forecasting the effects of COVID-19 and general economic uncertainties. These impairment charges are included in the line item “impairment of goodwill and intangible assets” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and both are in the Curation Foods business segment.
In fiscal year 2021 the Company executed a settlement agreement related to a legal matter with Pacific Harvest, Inc. and Rancho Harvest, Inc., In connection with the settlement agreement, the Company recorded a $1.8 million charge after considering the total settlement amount and insurance recoveries, and this amount is included in legal settlement charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2021. Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company announced a restructuring plan to drive enhanced profitability, focus the business on its strategic assets and redesign the organization to be the appropriate size to compete and thrive. This includes a reduction-in-force, a reduction in leased office spaces and the sale of non-strategic assets. The Company recorded $9.0 million, $3.8 million, and $4.1 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, related to the restructuring plan. Restructuring costs for fiscal year 2022 increased $5.2 million compared to fiscal year 2021 due to increased restructuring activity in our Curation Foods Segment as part of our Project SWIFT initiatives to sell Curation Foods assets and prepare the Company for the transition to Lifecore. Restructuring costs for fiscal year 2021 decreased $0.3 million compared to fiscal year 2020 due to a decrease in restructuring activity related to continuing operations in our Curation Foods Segment as part of our Project SWIFT initiatives. Refer to Note 13 - Restructuring Costs in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
Other:
Interest Income
The decrease in interest income in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, and 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was not significant.
Interest Expense
The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, was primarily a result of prepaid interest and prepayment penalties incurred related to payments made on our term debt resulting from the sales of our investment in Windset and the Eat Smart Disposition, combined with higher interest rates and an increase in deferred financing costs incurred as a result of our debt refinancing in December 2020.
The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of (i) an increased interest rate, due to the Company's increased Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), combined with our debt refinancing in December 2020 at higher interest rates, (ii) an increase in deferred financing costs from those incurred in connection with the Company's amendments to the Credit Agreement since May 31, 2020 combined with our debt refinancing in December 2020, and (iii) an increase in total outstanding debt from $190.3 million as of May 31, 2020 to $193.9 million as of May 30, 2021.
Transition Services Income
In fiscal year 2022 the Company earned $5.8 million of transition services income related to transition services provided to Taylor Farms related to the Eat Smart Disposition which is meant to defray costs incurred to provide the transition services which are reported within Selling, general and administrative costs.
Loss on Debt Refinancing
The loss on debt refinancing was due to a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the Company refinancing its debt in December 2020.
Other Income (Expense), net
The increase in other income (expense), net for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 compared to the respective prior periods was primarily the result of the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap liability.
Income Tax Benefit
The change in income tax benefit for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the Company’s increase in net loss before income taxes from continuing operations and the Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 changed from a tax provision benefit of 16.59% to a tax provision benefit of 11.20% in comparison to fiscal year 2021 after adjustment for discontinued operations. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a significant valuation allowance increase and the impairment of Yucatan Foods goodwill.
The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 changed from a tax provision benefit of 28.63% to a tax provision benefit of 16.59% in comparison to fiscal year 2020 after adjustment for discontinued operations. The decrease in the income tax benefit for fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a significant decrease in the Company's loss before tax from continuing operations, and the increase in change in valuation allowance which offsets federal and state research and development credits, and $2.8 million of NOL carryback benefit applied only for fiscal year 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of May 29, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 million, a net increase of $0.3 million from $1.3 million at May 30, 2021.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2022 was $24.4 million compared to $15.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2021. The primary uses of net cash in operating activities during fiscal year 2022 were (1) a $97.4 million net loss, (2) an $6.6 million net increase in working capital, and (3) a $6.9 million reduction in deferred taxes. These uses of cash were partially offset by (1) $60.8 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (2) $20.5 million of depreciation/amortization and stock based compensation expense, and (3) $5.5 million Loss on sale of Eat Smart and loss on disposal of property and equipment related to restructuring, net.
The primary factors for the increase in working capital during the fiscal year ended 2022, was a $6.0 million increase in inventory driven by production in our Avocado Products division and to support the sales growth at Lifecore, a $6.1 million increase in accounts receivable driven by sales increases and timing of customer payments, and a $3.2 million net increase in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities driven by severance accruals, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $9.3 million related to the increase in inventory and timing of payments.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2022 was $81.8 million, compared to $10.9 million of net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the receipt of $73.5 million related to the Eat Smart Disposition (partially offset by a $9.8 million working capital adjustment and cash expenses related to the Eat Smart Disposition), $45.1 million related to the sale of the Company's investment in Windset, partially offset by the purchase of $28.1 million of equipment to support the growth of the Company’s Lifecore and Curation Foods businesses.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was $57.0 million compared to $3.4 million for the same period last year. The net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to $86.4 million of debt pay downs under the Company's term loan, partially offset by a $20.0 million draw on the term loan multi draw accordion feature to fund Lifecore capital expenditures, and an $11.0 million net draw down on the Company’s line of credit.
Capital Expenditures
Landec incurred $28.1 million of capital expenditures during fiscal year 2022, which were primarily represented by continued facility modifications and expansions and equipment purchases intended to increase production capacity to support the growth and increased production efficiency of the Lifecore and Curation Foods businesses. Capital expenditures incurred during fiscal year 2021 were $23.8 million. During the fiscal year ended 2022, capital expenditures for Lifecore and Curation Foods were $23.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and capital expenditures for discontinued operations were $1.8 million.
Debt
On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan, BMO, and City National Bank, as lenders (collectively, the “Lenders”), and JPMorgan as administrative agent, pursuant to which the Lenders provided the Company with a $100.0 million revolving line of credit (the “Revolver”) and a $50.0 million term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), guaranteed by each of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets, with the exception of the Company’s investment in Windset.
On November 30, 2018, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which increased the Term Loan to $100.0 million and the Revolver to $105.0 million.
On October 25, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which increased the Term Loan to $120.0 million and decreased the revolver to $100.0 million. Both the Revolver and the Term Loan mature on October 25, 2022, with the Term Loan requiring quarterly principal payments of $3.0 million and the remainder continuing to be due at maturity.
On March 19, 2020, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Seventh Amendment”), which among other changes, retroactively increased the maximum Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of the Company’s total indebtedness on such date to the Company’s consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on or most recently prior to such date) to 5.75 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended February 23, 2020, which decreases back to 5.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2020. The maximum Total Leverage Ratio thereafter decreases by 25 basis points each subsequent fiscal quarter thereafter, until it reaches 3.50 for the fiscal quarter ending November 28, 2021, and then remains fixed through maturity. The Seventh Amendment also introduced additional financial covenants that remain in effect through May 31, 2020, including minimum cumulative monthly Unadjusted EBITDA thresholds and maximum capital expenditures, as well as additional reporting requirements and frequencies. Interest on both the Revolver and the Term Loan continues to be based upon the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio, at a per annum rate of either (i) the prime rate plus a spread of between 0.25% and 3.00% or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a spread of between 1.25% and 4.00%.
On July 15, 2020, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Eighth Amendment”), which among other things, (i) modified the definition of EBITDA to increase the limit on permitted exclusions for certain unusual, extraordinary or one-time cash items for each fiscal quarter ending on or after February 28, 2021, to a maximum of 20% of EBITDA, and (ii) restricted the Company from making Capital Expenditures over certain thresholds. Interest continues to be based on the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio, at a revised per annum Applicable Rate of either (i) the prime rate plus a spread of between 0.75% and 3.50% or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a spread of between 1.75% and 4.50%, plus, in each case, a commitment fee, as applicable, of between 0.15% and 0.55%, as further described in the Eighth Amendment.
On December 31, 2020, the Company refinanced its existing Term Loan and Revolver by entering into two separate Credit Agreements (the "New Credit Agreements") with BMO and Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (“Goldman”) and Guggenheim Credit Services, LLC ("Guggenheim"), as lenders (collectively, the “Refinance Lenders”). Pursuant to the credit agreement related to the revolving credit facility, BMO has provided the Company, Curation Foods and Lifecore, as co-borrowers, with an up to $75.0 million revolving line of credit (the “Refinance Revolver”) and serves as administrative agent of the Refinance Revolver. Pursuant to the credit agreement related to the term loan, Goldman and Guggenheim have provided the Company, Curation Foods and Lifecore, as co-borrowers, with an up to $170.0 million term loan facility (split equally between Goldman and Guggenheim) (the “Refinance Term Loan”) and Goldman serves as administrative agent of the Refinance Term Loan. The Refinance Revolver and Refinance Term Loan are guaranteed, and secured by, substantially all of the Company’s and the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries' assets.
The Refinance Term Loan matures on December 31, 2025. The Refinance Revolver matures on December 31, 2025 or, if the Refinance Term Loan remains outstanding on such date, ninety (90) days prior to the maturity date of the Refinance Term Loan (on October 2, 2025).
The Refinance Term Loan provides for principal payments by the Company of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears in equal installments, commencing on March 30, 2023, with the remainder due at maturity.
Interest on the Refinance Revolver is based upon the Company’s average availability, at a per annum rate of either (i) LIBOR rate plus a spread of between 2.00% and 2.50% or (ii) base rate plus a spread of between 1.00% and 1.50%, plus a commitment fee, as applicable, of 0.375%. Interest on the Refinance Term Loan is at a per annum rate based on either (i) the base rate plus a spread of 7.50% or (ii) the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 8.50%. The Refinance Term Loan Credit Agreement also provides that in the event of a prepayment of any amount other than the scheduled installments within twelve months after the
closing date, a penalty will be assessed equal to the aggregate amount of interest that would have otherwise been payable from date of prepayment event until twelve months after the closing date plus 3% of the amount prepaid.
The New Credit Agreements provide the Company the right to increase the revolver commitments under the Refinance Revolver, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (including consent from BMO), by obtaining additional commitments from either BMO or another lending institution at an amount of up to $15.0 million.
The New Credit Agreements contain customary financial covenants and events of default under which the obligations thereunder could be accelerated and/or the interest rate increased in specified circumstances.
In connection with the New Credit Agreements, the Company incurred debt issuance costs from the lender and third-parties of $10.3 million.
Concurrent with the close of the New Credit Agreements, the Company repaid all outstanding borrowings under the current Credit Agreement, and terminated the Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the Company recognized a loss in fiscal year 2021 of $1.1 million, as a result of the non-cash write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing under the New Credit Agreements.
In April 2022 the Company amended the New Credit Agreement to make available again $20.0 million of term debt that that had been previously repaid. In connection with this amendment, the Company incurred debt issuance costs from the lender of $0.7 million.
As of May 29, 2022, (i) $40.0 million was outstanding on the Refinance Revolver, at an interest rate of 3.00%, (ii) $103.7 million was outstanding on the Refinance Term Loan, at an interest rate of 9.5%, and (iii) the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and had no events of default under the New Credit Agreements.
Contractual Obligations
The Company’s material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of May 29, 2022, are as follows:
Debt obligations reflect the principal amounts outstanding on the Term Loan and the Revolver at fiscal year-end. The interest payment amounts above are based on principal amounts and contractual rates at fiscal year-end. See Note 6 - Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the Company’s loans.
The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of its research and development programs; the continued development of marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; the ability of the Company to establish and maintain new licensing arrangements; the costs associated with employment-related claims; any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities; weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce, the timing and amount, if any, of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing intellectual property rights; the ability to comply with regulatory requirements; the emergence of competitive technology and market forces; the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements; and other factors. If the Company’s currently available funds, together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs, the Company would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners, additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities. There can be no assurance that additional funds, if required, will be available to the Company on favorable terms, if at all.
The Company believes that its cash from operations, along with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under its line of credit will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.
