Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial position and our results of operations for each of the two years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This discussion should be read in conjunction with “Item 15. - Consolidated Financial Statements” beginning on page of this report and with other financial information included elsewhere in this report. Unless stated otherwise, all financial information presented below, throughout this report, and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes includes Mannatech and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measure section herein for a description of how Constant dollar (“Constant dollar”) growth rate (a Non-GAAP financial metric) is determined.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Mannatech is a global wellness solution provider, which was incorporated and began operations in November 1993. We develop and sell innovative, high quality, proprietary nutritional supplements, topical and skin care and anti-aging products, and weight-management products that target optimal health and wellness. We currently sell our products in three regions: (i) the Americas (the United States, Canada and Mexico); (ii) Europe/the Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Namibia, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom); and (iii) Asia/Pacific (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China).
We conduct our business as a single reporting segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately 163,000 active associates and preferred customer positions held by individuals that purchased our products and/or packs or paid associate fees during the last 12 months, who we refer to as current associates and preferred customers. New pack sales and the receipt of new associate fees in connection with new positions in our network are leading indicators for the long-term success of our business. New associate or preferred customer positions are created in our network when our associate fees are paid or packs and products are purchased for the first time under a new account. We operate as a seller of nutritional supplements, topical and skin care and anti-aging products, and weight-management products through our network marketing distribution channels operating in 24 countries and direct e-commerce retail in China. We review and analyze net sales by geographical location and by packs and products on a consolidated basis. Each of our subsidiaries sells similar products and exhibits similar economic characteristics, such as selling prices and gross margins.
Because we sell our products through network marketing distribution channels, the opportunities and challenges that affect us most are: recruitment of new and retention of current associates and preferred customers that occupy sales or purchasing positions in our network; entry into new markets and growth of existing markets; niche market development; new product introduction; and investment in our infrastructure. Our subsidiary in China, Meitai, is currently operating as a traditional retailer under a cross-border e-commerce model. Meitai cannot legally conduct a direct selling business in China unless it acquires a direct selling license in China.
Current Economic Conditions and Recent Developments
Overall net sales increased $8.4 million, or 5.5%, for 2021, as compared to 2020. Our 2021 net sales increased $4.7 million, or 3.1%, on a Constant dollar basis (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below), and favorable foreign exchange caused a $3.7 million increase in GAAP net sales as compared to 2020.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, including changes in: Net Sales, Gross Profit, and Income (loss) from Operations. We refer to these adjusted financial measures as Constant dollar items, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate, which is the prior year’s rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.

Net Sales
Overall net sales increased by $8.4 million, or 5.5%, for 2021, as compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our operations outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 70.7% of our consolidated net sales, whereas in the same period in 2020, our operations outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 70.3% of our consolidated net sales.
Sales for the Americas increased by $1.9 million, or 4.2%, to $46.8 million for 2021 as compared to $44.9 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a 9.9% increase in revenue per active independent associate and preferred customer and a 1.7% increase in the number of active independent associates and preferred customers. Foreign currency exchange had the effect of increasing revenue by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The currency impact is due to the strengthening of the Mexican Peso.
During 2021, Asia/Pacific sales increased by $5.6 million, or 6.1%, to $97.7 million as compared to $92.1 million for 2020. This increase was primarily due to a 20.5% increase in revenue per active independent associate and preferred customer, which was partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in the number of active independent associates and preferred customers. Foreign currency exchange had the effect of increasing revenue by $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The currency impact is primarily due to the strengthening of the Korean Won and Australian Dollar, which was partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen.
During 2021, EMEA sales increased by $0.9 million, or 6.3%, to $15.3 million as compared to $14.4 million for 2020. This increase was primarily due to a 25.9% increase in revenue per active independent associate and preferred customer and a 9.0% increase in the number of active independent associates and preferred customers. Foreign currency exchange had the effect of increasing revenue by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. The currency impact is primarily due to the strengthening of the South African Rand.
Our sales mix for the years ended December 31, was as follows (in millions, except percentages):
Change
2021 2020 Dollar Percentage
Consolidated product sales $ 151.0 $ 146.2 $ 4.8 3.3 %
Consolidated pack sales and associate fees 8.0 4.2 3.8 90.5 %
Consolidated other 0.8 1.0 (0.2) (20.0) %
Total consolidated net sales $ 159.8 $ 151.4 $ 8.4 5.5 %
Product Sales
Our product sales are made to our independent associates and preferred customers at published wholesale prices. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $4.8 million, or 3.3%, to $151.0 million, as compared to $146.2 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in product sales was primarily due to an increase in the average order value. The average order value in 2021 was $190, as compared to $183 for the same period in 2020. The number of orders processed during the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 2.3% as compared to the same period in 2020.
Pack Sales and Associate Fees
The Company collects associate fees in lieu of selling packs in certain markets. Associate fees are paid annually by new and continuing associates to the Company, which entitle them to earn commissions, benefits and incentives for that year. The Company collected associate fees in lieu of pack sales within the United States, Canada, South Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In the Republic of Korea and Mexico, packs may still be purchased by our associates who wish to build a Mannatech business. These packs contain products that are discounted from both the published retail and associate prices. There are several pack options available to our associates. Pack sales may be completed during the final stages of the registration process, entitling the Associates to earn commissions, benefits, and incentives for that year. These packs can provide new associates with valuable training and promotional materials, as well as products for resale to retail customers, demonstration purposes, and personal consumption. Business-building associates in these markets can also purchase an upgrade pack, which provides the associate with additional promotional materials. We also do not collect associate fees or sell packs in our non-direct selling business in mainland China.
The dollar amount of pack sales and associate fees associated with new and continuing independent associate positions held by individuals in our network was as follows, for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentages):
Change
2021 2020 Dollar Percentage
New $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ - - %
Continuing 7.5 3.7 3.8 102.7 %
Total $ 8.0 $ 4.2 $ 3.8 90.5 %
Total pack sales and associate fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $3.8 million, or 90.5%, to $8.0 million, as compared to $4.2 million for the same period in 2020. The number of packs sold and associate fees collected increased by 4.2%. Also, the average pack value for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $84, as compared to $45 for the same period in 2020.
During 2021 and continuing into 2022, we took the following actions in an effort to increase the number of independent associates and preferred customers:
•registered our most popular products with the appropriate regulatory agencies in all countries of operations where possible;
•rolled out new products;
•launched an aggressive marketing and educational campaign;
•continued to strengthen compliance initiatives;
•concentrated on publishing results of research studies and clinical trials related to our products;
•initiated additional incentives;
•explored new advertising and educational tools to broaden name recognition; and
•implemented changes to our global associate career and compensation plan.
The approximate number of active new and continuing active associates and preferred customers who purchased our packs or products or paid associate fees during the twelve months ended December 31 was as follows:
2021 2020
New 84,000 51.5 % 83,000 45.4 %
Continuing 79,000 48.5 % 100,000 54.6 %
Total 163,000 100.0 % 183,000 100.0 %
Other Sales
Other sales consisted of: (i) sales of promotional materials; (ii) monthly fees collected for the Success Tracker™ and Mannatech+ customized electronic business-building and educational materials, databases and applications; (iii) training and event registration fees; and (iv) a reserve for estimated sales refunds and returns. Promotional materials, training, database applications and business management tools to support our independent associates, which in turn helps stimulate product sales.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, other sales decreased by $0.2 million, or 20.0%, to $0.8 million, as compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in active new and continuing active associates and preferred customers.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross profit increased by $9.7 million, or 8.4%, to $125.6 million, as compared to $115.9 million for the same period in 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 78.6% for 2021, as compared to 76.5% for 2020 due to the benefits from foreign exchange (mostly Korea Won and South Africa Rand), price increases in a few markets and improvements in our supply chain.
Commission and Incentives
As sales grew, commission expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, by 4.9%, or $2.9 million to $61.6 million, as compared to $58.7 million for the same period in 2020. Commissions as a percentage of net sales were 38.5% for the year ending December 31, 2021 and 38.8% for the same period in the prior year.
Incentive costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 by 18.5%, or $0.5 million, to $2.2 million as compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2020. The costs of incentives, as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 1.8% for the same period in 2020. This decrease was related to travel incentives in the Americas and Asia/Pacific as governments required quarantine periods before entering the country, which reduced travel.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses include a combination of both fixed and variable expenses. These expenses consist of compensation and benefits for employees, temporary and contract labor and marketing-related expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, overall selling and administrative expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 5.7%, to $29.4 million, as compared to $27.8 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in selling and administrative expenses consisted of a $1.9 million increase in payroll costs and a $0.1 million increase in distribution costs, which was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in contract labor costs and a $0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation.
Other Operating Costs
Other operating costs include accounting/legal/consulting fees, travel and entertainment expenses, credit card processing fees, off-site storage fees, utilities, bad debt, and other miscellaneous operating expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, other operating costs increased by $1.4 million, or 7%, to $21.6 million, as compared to $20.2 million for the same period in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other operating costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 13.5%, as compared to 13.4% for the same period in 2020. The increase was due to a $0.8 million increase in consulting fees, and the $0.6 million charge to earnings for our expected outcome from the Korea Customs Audit (see Note 11).
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was $1.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Other (Expense) Income, net
Primarily due to foreign exchange gains, other (expense) income was $(0.2) million and $1.2 million for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes

Foreign Tax
Income from our international operations is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate. Although we may receive foreign income tax credits that would reduce the total amount of income taxes owed in the United States, we may not be able to fully utilize our foreign income tax credits in the United States.
U.S. Tax
For each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was (10.7)% and (9.4)%, respectively. In 2021, the Company’s effective rate differed from the statutory rate due to the effect of changes in valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions, taking the IRC Section 250 deduction, and applying foreign tax credits. In 2020, the Company had a significant decrease in its rate due to the carryback of U.S net operating losses as allowed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), enacted on March 27, 2020.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s valuation allowance was $7.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC Topic 740”) require a company to record a valuation allowance when the “more likely than not” criterion for realizing a deferred tax asset cannot be met. A company is to use judgment in reviewing both positive and negative evidence of realizing a deferred tax asset. Furthermore, the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence can be objectively verified.
The valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):
Country 2021 2020
Australia $ - $ 0.2
China 0.5 0.4
Colombia 0.5 0.6
Cyprus 0.2 0.2
Mexico 1.9 3.1
Norway 0.1 0.1
South Africa 0.2 0.2
Switzerland 0.5 0.5
Taiwan 0.6 1.1
United States 3.4 5.5
Total $ 7.9 $ 11.9
SEASONALITY
We believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal. We have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to, among other things:
•the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives;
•our ability to attract and retain associates and preferred customers;
•the timing of our incentives and contests;
•the general overall economic outlook;
•government regulations;
•global pandemic;
•the outcome of certain lawsuits;
•the perception and acceptance of network marketing; and
•the consumer perception of our products and overall operations.
As a result of these and other factors, our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future. Period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets, as well as in existing markets, will follow our historical patterns. The market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash and Cash Equivalents
As of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 6.8%, or $1.9 million, to $25.6 million from $27.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company is required to restrict cash for (i) direct selling insurance premiums and credit card sales in the Republic of Korea; (ii) reserve on credit card sales in the United States and Canada; and (iii) Australia building lease collateral. The current portion of restricted cash at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $0.9 million. Fluctuations in currency rates produced a decrease of $2.7 million in cash and cash equivalents in 2021 as compared to an increase of $1.3 million in 2020.
Our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses, including commissions and incentives, capital assets, inventory purchases, and periodic cash dividends. We fund our business objectives, operations, and expansion of our operations through net cash flows from operations rather than incurring long-term debt.
Working Capital
Working capital represents total current assets less total current liabilities. At December 31, 2021, our working capital increased by $2.2 million, or 21.0%, to $12.7 million from $10.5 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in our current liabilities.
Net Cash Flows
Our net consolidated cash flows consisted of the following, for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
Provided by / (used in): 2021 2020
Operating activities $ 10.8 $ 6.0
Investing activities $ (0.7) $ (0.9)
Financing activities $ (9.3) $ (9.9)
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this increase was due to improved operating profits and working capital management.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we invested $0.7 million and $0.9 million in computer hardware and software, respectively.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our financing activities used cash of $9.3 million compared to cash used of $9.9 million for the same period of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used approximately $0.4 million in the repayment of finance lease obligations and other long term liabilities, $4.3 million in the payment of dividends to shareholders, $5.1 million in the repurchase of common stock, which was partially offset by $0.5 million cash provided by the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used approximately $0.6 million in the repayment of finance lease obligations and other long term liabilities, $3.4 million in the payment of dividends to shareholders, and $5.9 million for the repurchase of common stocks.
General Liquidity and Cash Flows
Short Term Liquidity
We believe our existing liquidity and cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations for the next 12 months. As our primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations, this will be dependent on our ability to maintain and/or continue to improve revenue as compared to our operational expenses. However, if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet current business plans, projections, and existing capital requirements, we may be required to raise additional funds, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents held in bank accounts in foreign countries totaled $22.6 million and $18.6 million, respectively.
We are engaged in ongoing audits in various tax jurisdictions and other disputes in the normal course of business. It is impossible at this time to predict whether we will incur any liability, or to estimate the ranges of damages, if any, in connection with these matters. Adverse outcomes on these uncertainties may lead to substantial liability or enforcement actions that could adversely affect our cash position. The Canada Revenue Agency is auditing the Company's GST filings from January 2019 through April 2021. Management believes the likelihood of an additional GST liability or penalty from the audit is remote and therefore has not accrued a liability related to this audit at December 31, 2021. For more information see Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 7 Income Taxes, Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 12 Litigation to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have contractual purchase commitments with certain raw material suppliers to purchase minimum quantities and to ensure exclusivity of our raw materials and the proprietary nature of our products. At December 31, 2021, we have one supply agreement that requires the Company to purchase an aggregate of $4.8 million through 2022, with no purchase commitments thereafter. We also maintain other supply agreements and manufacturing agreements to protect our products, regulate product costs, and help ensure quality control standards. These agreements do not require us to purchase any minimum quantities. We have no present commitments or agreements with respect to acquisitions or purchases of any manufacturing facilities; however, management from time to time explores the possibility of the benefits of purchasing a raw material manufacturing facility to help control costs of our raw materials and help ensure quality control standards.
We have operating lease liabilities for the property and equipment we use in our business operations. These operating lease liabilities represent our minimum future payment obligations on operating leases, including imputed interest. At December 31, 2021, our operating lease liabilities were $5.8 million, of which $1.5 million was recorded in Accrued expenses and $4.3 million was recorded in Other long-term liabilities. We also have finance lease liabilities of $0.1 million and lease restoration liabilities of $0.3 million.
We have pension obligation of $0.9 million related to our employee benefit plan at our Japan subsidiary.
Responding to COVID-19, we have taken steps to protect the health, safety and well-being of our customers, associates, employees, and communities by closing some offices and equipping various staff members to work remotely. The Company depends on an independent salesforce of distributors to market and sell its products to consumers. Developments such as social distancing and shelter-in-place directives has impacted their ability to engage with potential and existing customers. The adverse economic effects of COVID-19 includes government restriction and changes in consumer demand for the Company’s products. The Company has rescheduled corporate sponsored events, and in some cases, our associates have canceled sales meetings.
For some products, the Company experienced shortages of raw materials and ingredients. We experienced challenges in getting materials and ingredients to our contract manufacturers and finished products to our distribution centers as a result of reductions in global transportation capacity. Despite the impact on the global supply chain, the Company has overcome obstacles in shipping to our customers.
Prolonged workforce disruptions, continued disruption in our supply chain and potential decreases in consumer demands could negatively impact our sales as well as the Company’s overall liquidity in the next twelve months, however, such impact is currently unknown.
Long Term Liquidity
We believe our cash flows from operations should be adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations and possible international expansion costs for the long term. As our primary source of liquidity is from our cash flows from operations, this will be dependent on our ability to maintain and and/or improve revenue as compared to operational expenses.
However, if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet anticipated business plans and existing capital requirements, we may be required to raise additional funds, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
Our future access to the capital markets may be adversely impacted if we fail to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules for the continued listing of our stock. We continuously monitor our compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing rules.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any special-purpose entity arrangements, nor do we have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
