Prior to the acquisition of Lifted on February 24, 2020, LFTD Partners Inc., formerly known as Acquired Sales Corp., had no sources of revenue, and LFTD Partners Inc. had a history of recurring losses, which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of $11,414,602 as of December 31, 2021. LFTD Partners Inc. has Preferred Stock outstanding that is currently accruing dividends at the rate of 3% per year. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $7,092,631, primarily driven by the raise of $6,615,000 in exchange for Series A convertible preferred stock.

The Company has a history of losses as evidenced by the accumulated deficit at December 31, 2021 of $11,414,602. We plan to sustain the Company as a going concern by taking the following actions: (1) continuing to operate Lifted; (2) acquiring and/or developing profitable businesses that will create positive income from operations; and/or (3) completing private placements of our common stock and/or preferred stock. We believe that by taking these actions, we will be provided with sufficient future operations and cash flow to continue as a going concern. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating such actions on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, many of such actions can be expected to result in substantial dilution to the existing shareholders of the Company.
Selected Quarterly Financial Information
On February 24, 2020, we acquired 100% of the ownership interests of Lifted. All of our sales are generated by our wholly-owned subsidiary Lifted; LFTD Partners as an entity by itself generates no sales. We also do not recognize any revenue or earnings from our investments in Bendistillery, Ablis or Bend Spirits.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements accompanying this annual report.
Other Matters
We may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in addition to the matters discussed above in “NOTE 12 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS”. We intend to vigorously pursue and defend such litigation. Although the outcome of these other matters is currently not determinable, our management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result, in significant economic disruption despite progress made in recent months in the development and distribution of vaccines. It has already disrupted Lifted’s operations, global travel and supply chains, and adversely impacted global commercial activity. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds COVID-19, the evolution and future impact of its variants, its potential long-term economic effects, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities and businesses and of various efforts to inoculate the global population. The travel restrictions, limits on hours of operations and/or closures of non-essential businesses, and other efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 have significantly disrupted business activity globally and there is uncertainty as to if and when these disruptions will fully subside.
Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Lifted’s, our customers’ and target companies’ business and operations in future periods. Although our total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2021 were not materially impacted by COVID-19, we believe our revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods until the effects of the pandemic have fully subsided and the current macroeconomic environment has substantially recovered. The uncertainty related to COVID-19 may also result in increased volatility in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements. We have made some efforts to try to adapt our operations to meet the challenges of this uncertain and rapidly evolving situation, including expanding operations in areas where we perceive government restrictions on business operations are relatively less burdensome, and focusing some of our new product development in areas where we perceive government restrictions and prohibitions on hemp-derived cannabinoid products are relatively less likely. The COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications, including Illinois Governor Pritzker’s Executive Order in response to the pandemic, materially damaged Lifted’s business, among other things by disrupting Lifted’s access to its employees, suppliers, packaging, distributors and customers. That is why Lifted applied for and received funding under the federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and the federal Paycheck Protection Program.
Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that may negatively impact our business in future periods include, but are not limited to: disruptions of Lifted’s workforce; limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business, purchase our products, and make timely payments; curtailed consumer spending; deferred purchasing decisions; supply chain problems and delays, and changes in demand from retail customers. We will continue to actively monitor the nature and extent of the impact to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
