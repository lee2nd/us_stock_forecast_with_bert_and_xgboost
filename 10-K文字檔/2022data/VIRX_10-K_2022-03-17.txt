Item 7.	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please also see the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
Viracta is a clinical-stage, precision oncology company focused on advancing new medicines for the treatment of virus-associated malignancies. The association of viruses and cancer has been well characterized, and Viracta’s lead program is focused on cancers associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (“EBV”). Viracta’s lead product candidate is an all-oral combination therapy of its proprietary investigational drug, nanatinostat and the antiviral agent valganciclovir (collectively referred to as “Nana-val”). Nana-val is currently being investigated in multiple ongoing clinical trials, including NAVAL-1, a pivotal, global, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 basket trial for the treatment of multiple subtypes of relapsed/refractory (“R/R”) Epstein-Barr virus-positive (“EBV+”) lymphoma, as well as a multinational, open-label Phase 1b/2 trial for the treatment of EBV+ recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“R/M NPC”) and other EBV+ solid tumors. Viracta’s development pipeline also includes vecabrutinib, a clinical-stage non-covalent ITK/BTK inhibitor and VRx-510 (formerly SNS-510), a preclinical-stage PDK-1 inhibitor. Viracta is evaluating future development and collaboration opportunities for vecabrutinib in combination with chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-cell therapies and VRx-510 in multiple oncology indications.
EBV+ Lymphoma
In June 2021, Viracta announced the initiation of NAVAL-1, a global, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 basket trial to evaluate Nana-val for the treatment of R/R EBV+ lymphoma with centers in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, with key secondary endpoints including duration of response, survival outcomes, and the safety profile of the combined treatment. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease following two or more prior therapies (one or more for extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma) without curative treatment options will be eligible for enrollment. If successful, Viracta believes this trial could potentially support multiple new drug application filings across various EBV+ lymphoma subtypes. The trial employs a Simon two-stage design where a limited number of patients are initially enrolled into cohorts in Stage 1 and, if a pre-specified activity threshold is reached, additional patients will be enrolled in Stage 2. During Stage 2, Viracta anticipates discussing the preliminary results with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and may amend the protocol to include additional patients as necessary to enable registration. Viracta anticipates providing an update on the first cohort(s) that have expanded into Stage 2 in the second half of 2022.
Viracta is also conducting a Phase 1b/2 trial of Nana-val for the treatment of EBV+ R/R lymphoma and final results from this trial were presented in an oral presentation at the 63rd American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting in December 2021. The data demonstrated promising activity in multiple subtypes of heavily pre-treated, R/R EBV+ lymphoma patients, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. Complete responses were observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), T/NK-cell lymphoma (“T/NK-NHL”), and immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (“IA-LPD”). The median duration of response was 10.4 months.
Viracta has received Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of R/R EBV+ lymphoid malignancies, in addition to orphan drug designations for the treatment of EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (“EBV+DLBCL,NOS”), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (“PTLD”), plasmablastic lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma.
EBV+ Solid Tumors
In October 2021, Viracta announced the initiation of a multinational, open-label Phase 1b/2 trial for the treatment of EBV+ R/M NPC and other EBV+ solid tumors. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Nana-val alone and in combination with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The Phase 1b dose escalation portion is designed to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of Nana-val in patients with EBV+ R/M NPC. In Phase 2, up to sixty patients with EBV+ R/M NPC will be randomized to receive Nana-val at the RP2D with or without pembrolizumab, to evaluate safety, overall response rate, and potential pharmacodynamic markers. Additionally, patients with other EBV+ solid tumors
will be enrolled to receive Nana-val at the RP2D in a Phase 1b dose expansion cohort. Viracta anticipates providing preliminary clinical data from the trial in 2022.
Impact of COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, otherwise known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to the coronavirus pandemic. This pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity, and many countries and many states in the United States have reacted to the pandemic by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures, and restricting travel. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to rapidly evolve, and the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain and subject to change. For example, we have experienced an impact on the timing of clinical site initiations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken certain measures and continue to evaluate other potential measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our trials. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. These effects could have a material impact on our operations. The continued COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our workforce and our research and development activities. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Financial Operations Overview
Research and Development Expenses
We expense all research and development expenses as they are incurred. Research and development expenses primarily include:
•clinical and regulatory-related costs;
•expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (“CROs”);
•manufacturing and stability testing costs and related supplies and materials; and
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and share-based compensation expense.
The majority of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with the development of Nana-val. The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The successful development and commercialization of Nana-val is still highly uncertain. We are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development and regulatory review of Nana-val, though such costs may be significant. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our product candidate.
The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:
•per patient trial costs;
•the number of sites included in the trials;
•the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects;
•the number of subjects that participate in the trials;
•the number of doses that subjects receive;
•the cost of comparative agents used in trials;
•the drop-out or discontinuation rates of subjects;
•potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;
•the duration of patient follow-up; and
•the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
We do not yet know when Nana-val may be commercially available, if at all.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including share-based compensation. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for accounting, tax, patent costs, legal services, insurance, facility costs and costs associated with being a publicly traded company, including fees associated with investor relations and directors and officers liability insurance premiums. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our operating activities, prepare for the growth needs associated with potential commercialization of Nana-val and continue to incur additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company and maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements. These increases will likely include higher consulting costs, legal fees, accounting fees, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums and fees associated with investor relations.
Other income (expense)
Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense as well as various income or expense items of a non-recurring nature. We earn interest income from interest-bearing accounts and money market accounts for cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense is primarily attributable to interest charges associated with borrowings under our loan and security agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. This process involves reviewing contract and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of vendor agreements, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when it has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice monthly in arrears for services performed.
Clinical Trial Costs and Accruals
We accrue clinical trial costs based on work performed. In determining the amount to accrue, we rely on estimates of total costs incurred based on enrollment, the completion of clinical trials and other events. We follow this method because we believe reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a clinical trial can be made. However, the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending on a number of factors. Differences between the actual clinical trial costs and the estimated clinical trial costs that we have accrued in any prior period are recognized in the subsequent period in which the actual costs become known. Historically, our estimated accrued expenses have approximated actual expenses incurred; however, material differences could occur in the future.
Other Information
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and California tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $147.5 million and $105.3 million, respectively. The federal and California net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 and 2030, respectively, unless previously utilized. The portion of federal net operating losses created after 2017 of approximately $107.2 million do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company has Orphan Drug Credit carryforwards of $7.3 million. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 unless previously utilized. The California research and development tax credit will carry forward indefinitely. Furthermore, under the
U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017, although the treatment of tax losses generated before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in calendar year 2018 and beyond do not expire but may only offset 80% of our taxable income. This change may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years.
Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed our analysis to determine what, if any, impact any prior ownership change has had on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes the results of our operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $10.4 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases in costs incurred to support the initiation of the NAVAL-1 and solid tumor trials as well as an increase in headcount and non-cash share-based compensation.
Purchased and acquired in-process research and development. Purchased in-process research and development was related to the payment of $4.0 million to terminate the exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. The Company had granted Salubris an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to the Company’s patent and know-how rights to develop and commercialize nanatinostat in combination with an antiviral drug, such as valganciclovir, for treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of virus-associated malignancies in humans and non-humans in the Republic of China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which was re-acquired upon termination. The acquired in-process research and development included non-cash and non-recurring cost of $84.5 million associated with the estimated fair value of the in-process research and development projects acquired in the asset acquisition with no alternative future use, which was charged to expense on the Sunesis merger date.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $10.1 million. The increase was largely due to significant and non-recurring costs associated with the Merger, in addition to incremental costs associated with being a publicly traded company, including legal fees, audit fees, consulting expenses, filing fees and increased directors and officer’s insurance costs, as well as an increase in non-cash share-based compensation.
Gain on royalty purchase agreement. The gain was associated with upfront proceeds of $13.5 million recorded in connection with the multi-license milestone and royalty monetization transaction with XOMA (US) LLC.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to product development and have not realized product sales revenues from our planned principal operations. We have a limited operating history, and the sales and income potential of our business and market are unproven. We have experienced net losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $165.7 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. A successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. If we are unable to generate revenues adequate to support our cost structure, we will need to raise additional equity through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $103.6 million and working capital of approximately $96.2 million. In February 2021, as noted below, we completed the sale of common stock in a private placement
resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $65.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $17.1 million in cash and cash equivalents in the Merger previously discussed. We also received $13.5 million in upfront proceeds related to the Royalty Purchase Agreement with XOMA (US) LLC, as discussed in the financial statement footnotes. In May 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sale Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”), under which we may offer and sell up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time through the Sales Agent. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no shares have been sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement.
On November 4, 2021, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) and Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”) for up to $50.0 million. In connection with entering the new $50.0 million credit facility, we and SVB agreed to terminate our prior $15.0 million loan and security agreement with SVB. The existing $5.0 million debt balance outstanding from our previous credit facility with SVB was relieved under this new $50.0 million credit facility. The Loan Agreement was accounted for as a modification based on the effect of the changes in terms from the original SVB Loan Agreement. Under the terms of the $50.0 million credit facility, the remaining $45.0 million is available in two additional tranches of $20.0 million and $25.0 million under certain circumstances, and we are under no obligation to draw funds in the future.
Based on our current financial position and business plan, management believes that our existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as our credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We expect to continue to incur expenses and increase operating losses for at least the next several years. In the near-term, we anticipate incurring costs as we:
•conduct ongoing and planned development activities;
•initiate pre-approval and pre-commercialization activities for our lead product candidate;
•continue the preparation of the commercial manufacturing process;
•maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
•continue to fund the additional accounting, legal, insurance and other costs associated with being a public company.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities was $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to cash used in operating activities of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to operating results, which included the $13.5 million cash inflow associated with the Royalty Purchase Agreement with XOMA (US) LLC, and recorded into income in the period.
Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash used in investing activities of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was a result of the cash and cash equivalents acquired in the Merger offset by purchases of property and equipment and in-process research and development.
Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These amounts substantially reflect the net proceeds of the respective financing transactions closed in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:
•we may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete clinical development and commercialization for Nana-val;
•we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy for Nana-val;
•we may be required to undertake additional clinical trials and other studies of Nana-val;
•FDA may disagree with the design of our future clinical trials if any are necessary;
•we may experience variability in subjects, adjustments to clinical trial procedures and inclusion of additional clinical trial sites;
•FDA may not agree with the analysis of our clinical trial results;
•the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance or other bioequivalence parameters required by FDA for marketing approval;
•subjects in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our products;
•contract manufacturers, suppliers, and/or consultants may not meet appropriate timelines;
•we may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights;
•we may not be able to establish commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities; and
•we may not be able to establish commercialization capabilities.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. Any equity or debt financing may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to other parties rights to develop or commercialize our drug candidates that we would prefer to retain.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We enter into short-term and cancellable agreements in the normal course of operations with clinical sites and contract research organizations, or CROs, for clinical research studies, professional consultants and various third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical supply manufacturing and other services through purchase orders or other documentation, or that are undocumented except for an invoice. Such short-term agreements are generally outstanding for periods less than one year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services. The nature of the work being conducted under these agreements is such that, in most cases, the services may be cancelled upon prior notice of 90 days or less. Payments due upon cancellation generally consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations above.
On March 22, 2021, we entered into the Royalty Purchase Agreement with XOMA (US) LLC, pursuant to which, XOMA (US) LLC paid us an upfront payment of $13.5 million for the right to receive future milestones and royalties that we are entitled to receive under the terms of a license agreement with DOT Therapeutics-1, Inc. dated December 16, 2019 and a license agreement with Denovo Biopharma LLC dated December 5, 2019, net of certain obligations we have to a third party. Pursuant to the Royalty Purchase Agreement, we (directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary) are also eligible to receive an up to $20.0 million pre-commercialization, event-based milestone.
For descriptions of additional contractual obligations and commitments, see the section titled “Commitments and Contingencies” and "Debt" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
