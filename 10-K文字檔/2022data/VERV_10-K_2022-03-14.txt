Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or the Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a genetic medicines company pioneering a new approach to the care of cardiovascular disease, or CVD, transforming treatment from chronic management to single-course gene editing medicines. We believe that single-course treatments could provide substantial health benefits that are sustained throughout the lifetimes of patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, the most common form of CVD.
We were incorporated in March 2018 and commenced operations shortly thereafter. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to building our gene editing and LNP technology and advancing development of our portfolio of programs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property, conducting research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sales of our preferred stock and through the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering, or IPO. Through December 31, 2021, we had raised an aggregate of $523.2 million in gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock in private placements and common stock in our IPO.
We are a development-stage company, and all of our programs are at a preclinical stage of development. To date, we have not generated any revenue and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $120.3 million, $45.7 million and $19.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $186.9 million.
Our total operating expenses were $87.1 million, $40.6 million and $13.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with ongoing development activities related to our portfolio of programs as we continue our preclinical development of product candidates; advance these product candidates toward clinical development; further develop our base editing technology and manufacturing capabilities; seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; maintain, expand enforcement, defend, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire research and development and clinical personnel; ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and add operational, legal, compliance, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our research, product development, future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and other sources of capital, which may include collaborations or licensing arrangements with other companies or other strategic transactions. If we are unable to raise capital or obtain adequate funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are
unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $360.4 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. To finance our operations beyond that point we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. See “Liquidity and capital resources.”
Impact of COVID-19 on our business
In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization and to date, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. The length of time and full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, subject to change and difficult to predict. We, our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our contract research organizations, or CROs, experienced temporary reductions in the capacity to undertake research-scale production and to execute some preclinical studies. While these operations have since normalized, we, together with our CMOs and CROs, are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these operations.
We also plan to continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our other business operations. In an effort to provide a safe work environment for our employees, we have, among other things, limited employees in our office and lab facilities to those where on-site presence is needed for their job activities, increased the cadence of sanitization of our office and lab facilities, implemented various social distancing measures in our offices and labs including replacing all in-person meetings with virtual interactions, and are providing personal protective equipment for our employees present in our office and lab facilities. Recently, additional employees have returned to our office and lab facilities in limited capacities. We are continuing to monitor the impact and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and our response to it, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other business partners in light of the pandemic.
License and collaboration agreements
We have obligations under various license and collaboration agreements to make potentially significant milestone and success payments in the future and to pay royalties on sales of any product candidates covered by those agreements that eventually achieve regulatory approval and commercialization. For information regarding these agreements, see “Business-License and collaboration agreements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of our results of operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future and unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or we successfully enter into license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from third-party collaboration or license agreements, or any combination thereof.
Operating expenses
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, which include:
•the cost to obtain and maintain licenses to intellectual property, such as those with the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard, The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad, Beam Therapeutics Inc., or Beam, Verily Life Sciences LLC, Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc., or Acuitas, and others, and related future payments should certain development and regulatory milestones be achieved;
•personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and CROs;
•the cost of developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials, including the cost of raw materials used in our research and development activities;
•the cost of laboratory supplies and research materials; and
•facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are consumed.
In the early phases of development, our research and development costs are often devoted to proof-of-concept studies that are not necessarily allocable to a specific target; therefore, we have not yet begun tracking our expenses on a program-by-program basis.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our programs and product candidates into and through clinical development, and as we continue to develop additional product candidates. We also expect our discovery research efforts and our related personnel costs will increase and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses, including costs associated with stock-based compensation, will increase above historical levels. In addition, we may incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we may enter into license, acquisition and option agreements to acquire the rights to future product candidates.
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates or programs. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the following:
•the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•raising additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;
•the timing of filing and acceptance of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of future clinical trials for our product candidates;
•the successful initiation, enrollment and completion of clinical trials;
•our ability to achieve positive results from our future clinical programs that support a finding of safety and effectiveness and an acceptable risk-benefit profile in the intended patient populations of any product candidates we may develop;
•our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates for the expected indications and patient populations;
•our ability to hire and retain key research and development personnel;
•the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire through collaborations;
•our ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;
•the terms and timing of any existing or future collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;
•our ability to establish and obtain intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates and enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and claims;
•our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•our ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our product candidates following approval; and
•the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A change in any of these variables with respect to any of our current or future product candidates could significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidate we may develop.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, intellectual property, business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and direct and allocated facility-related expenses and other operating costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support increased research and development activities. We also expect to continue to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.
Other income (expense)
Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liability
Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liability consists primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the tranche rights associated with our Series A Preferred Stock. The preferred stock tranche liability was settled as of December 31, 2020, and therefore, there will be no further remeasurement.
Change in fair value of antidilution rights liability
Change in fair value of antidilution rights liability consists of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the antidilution rights liability associated with our license agreements with Harvard and Broad, or the Harvard/Broad License Agreement, and Broad, or the Broad License Agreement.
The antidilution rights represent the obligation to issue additional shares of common stock to Harvard and Broad following the completion of preferred stock financings and other equity financings, which was fully satisfied upon the closing of our IPO. At the inception of the agreements, the liability for the antidilution rights was recorded at fair value with the cost recorded as research and development expense and will be remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense) while the instruments are outstanding.
The antidilution rights liability was partially satisfied in 2019 and 2020 and was satisfied in full in June 2021 upon the closing of our IPO with the issuance of an additional 878,098 shares of our common stock.
Change in fair value of success payment liability
We are also obligated to pay to Harvard and Broad tiered success payments in the event our average market capitalization exceeds specified thresholds ascending from a high nine-digit dollar amount to $10.0 billion, or sale of our company for consideration in excess of those thresholds. In the event of a change of control of our company or a sale of our company, we are required to pay any related success payment in cash within a specified period following such event. Otherwise, the success payments may be settled at our option in either cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The maximum aggregate success payments that could be payable by us are $31.3 million. At inception of the agreements, the success payment liabilities were recorded at fair value with the cost recorded as research and development expense and will be remeasured at each reporting period with charges recorded in other income (expense) while the instrument is outstanding.
Depending on our valuation, the fair value of the antidilution rights and success payment liabilities, and the corresponding changes in fair value that we record in our statements of operations, could fluctuate significantly from period to period.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain success payment obligations were triggered, and amounts due to Harvard and Broad totaled $6.3 million. These amounts were settled in cash in November 2021. The remaining success payment obligations will continue to be revalued at the end of each reporting period.
Interest and other income (expense), net
Interest and other income primarily consisted of interest earned on our marketable securities and other miscellaneous income and expenses unrelated to our core operations.
Income tax
As of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $124.7 million and state NOL carryforwards of $114.4 million. The federal NOL carryforwards have an indefinite life and can be utilized to offset 80% of future taxable income, while the state NOL carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2041. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties as to their ultimate realization. We currently anticipate that there will be no change in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, we had no unrecognized tax benefits.
Results of operations
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Research and development expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Research and development expenses were $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $32.8 million was primarily due to the advancement of our pipeline and included the following:
•an increase in external expenses associated with preclinical studies (primarily animal-study costs) performed by outside consulting services, including third-party CROs, of $5.8 million;
•an increase in raw material costs and expenses associated with developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials of $10.9 million;
•an increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, of $12.6 million driven by an increase in headcount of employees involved in research and development activities;
•an increase in lab supplies of $2.5 million due to the increased investment in research and development activities in 2021;
•an increase in facility-related costs (including depreciation) and other allocated miscellaneous expenses of $1.0 million due to the increased investment in research and development activities in 2021; and
•an increase in other research and development costs of $1.9 million, primarily due to an increase in professional fees and consulting fees in support of increased investment in research and development activities in 2021;
•partially offset by a decrease in research and development expense attributed to license and milestone payments of $1.9 million, primarily due to fewer licensing transactions in 2021 (and therefore reduced upfront licensing payments).
We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our programs and product candidates into and through clinical development, and as we continue to develop additional product candidates.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $13.6 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•an increase of $8.3 million in personnel costs stemming from an increase in headcount to support our growth;
•an increase of $2.4 million in legal and professional service fees, primarily due to increased professional fees for audit, tax and consulting services; and
•an increase in other expenses of approximately $2.9 million, including increased insurance expense of $1.5 million for our directors and officers insurance policy and increases in software, IT and facility costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support increased research and development activities.
Other income (expense)
Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liability
The decrease of $2.5 million in fair value of the preferred stock tranche liability was due to the modification of the remaining milestones and subsequent settlement of the preferred stock tranche liability in March 2020, resulting in the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. The preferred stock tranche liability was fully settled as of December 31, 2020.
Change in fair value of antidilution rights liability
The increase of $20.2 million in fair value of the antidilution rights liability was primarily due to the settlement of the liability during the year ended December 31, 2021 with the issuance of 878,098 shares of our common stock. The settlement amount was $32.5 million and resulted in a fair value adjustment to the antidilution rights liability of $25.6 million due to an increase in the fair value of the shares being issued upon settlement.
Change in fair value of success payments liability
The increase of $5.4 million in fair value of the success payments liability was primarily attributable to the increase in the fair value of our common stock which resulted in a fair value adjustment of $7.8 million to other expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain success payment obligations were triggered, and amounts due to Harvard and Broad totaled $6.3 million. These amounts were settled in cash in November 2021. The remaining success payment obligations will continue to be revalued at the end of each reporting period.
Interest and other income (expense), net
The decrease of less than $0.1 million in 2021 was primarily attributable to losses on foreign currency transactions.
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and development expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and development expenses were $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $24.2 million was primarily due to the following:
•an increase in external expenses associated with preclinical studies (primarily animal-study costs) performed by outside consulting services, including third-party CROs, of $10.5 million;
•an increase in raw material costs and expenses associated with developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials of $5.7 million;
•an increase in personnel-related costs of $4.7 million driven by an increase in headcount of employees involved in research and development activities;
•an increase in lab supplies of $0.9 million due to the increased investment in research and development activities in 2020;
•an increase in facility-related costs (including depreciation) and other allocated miscellaneous expenses of $2.2 million due to the increased investment in research and development activities in 2020; and
•an increase in other research and development costs of $0.9 million, primarily due to an increase in professional fees and consulting fees in support of increased investment in research and development activities in 2020;
•partially offset by a decrease in research and development expense attributed to license and milestone payments of $0.7 million, primarily due to fewer licensing transactions in 2020 (and therefore reduced upfront licensing payments).
General and administrative expenses
•General and administrative expenses were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•an increase of $2.0 million in personnel, facility and other expenses stemming from an increase in headcount to support our growth; and
•an increase of $0.4 million in legal and professional service fees, primarily due to increased professional fees for audit, tax and consulting services.
Other income (expense)
Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liability
The change in fair value of the preferred stock tranche liability was primarily due to an increase in 2019 of the probability of the tranche milestones being met, followed by the settlement of the preferred stock tranche liability in March 2020 and issuance of Series A Preferred Stock.
Change in fair value of antidilution rights liability
The change in fair value of the antidilution rights liability was primarily attributable to a higher cumulative probability in 2020 of the respective triggering events being met.
Change in fair value of success payments liability
The change in fair value of the success payments liability was primarily attributable to a higher cumulative probability in 2020 of the respective triggering events being met.
Interest and other income (expense), net
The decrease of $0.1 million in 2020 was attributable to lower interest rates on our investments in 2020 compared to 2019.
Liquidity and capital resources
Sources of liquidity and capital
Since our inception in 2018, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and, if successful, clinical development of our programs. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through equity offerings. Through December 31, 2021, we had raised an aggregate of $523.2 million in gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock in private placements and common stock in our IPO. As of December 31, 2021, we had $360.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
In June 2021, we completed our IPO in which we issued 16,141,157 shares of common stock, including 2,105,368 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. We received net proceeds from our IPO of $281.6
million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us. In June 2021, we issued 878,098 shares of our common stock to Harvard and Broad as final settlement of the antidilution rights liability.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each period presented:
Operating activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $77.9 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $120.3 million and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.9 million. These amounts were partially offset by the following non-cash changes: change in fair value of antidilution rights and success payment liabilities of $33.4 million, depreciation expense of $1.5 million, stock-based compensation of $7.1 million, non-cash lease expense of $1.8 million and amortization of premiums on marketable securities of $1.5 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $35.3 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $45.7 million and a decrease attributable to non-cash items of $2.5 million associated with the fair value change in the preferred stock tranche liability. These amounts were partially offset by the following non-cash changes: change in fair value of antidilution rights and success payment liabilities of $7.7 million, depreciation expense of $1.3 million, stock-based compensation of $0.9 million and amortization of premiums on marketable securities of $0.4 million, as well as a net increase in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.6 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $7.4 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $19.3 million, which was partially offset by the following non-cash charges: change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liability of $4.9 million, non-cash research and development license expense of $2.8 million (primarily associated with our Harvard/ Broad License Agreement and Broad License Agreement), change in fair value of antidilution rights and success payment liabilities of $1.1 million, stock-based compensation of $0.4 million and a net increase in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.7 million.
Investing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $239.1 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $371.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $4.4 million, primarily related to lab equipment, which amounts were offset partially by maturities of marketable securities of $136.8 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $51.1 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $98.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.4 million, primarily related to lab equipment, which amounts were offset partially by maturities of marketable securities of $50.8 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $12.8 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $22.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of $1.9 million, primarily related to lab equipment, and which amounts were offset partially by maturities of marketable securities of $11.1 million.
Financing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $377.1 million, consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock of $93.8 million, net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our IPO of $285.2 million, proceeds from exercises of stock options of $1.0 million and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan of approximately $0.7 million, offset partially by payment of IPO expenses of $3.6 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $92.6 million consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock of $29.7 million and net proceeds from the issuance of Series A-2 Preferred Stock of $62.9 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $18.0 million consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock.
Funding requirements
Our operating expenses and future funding requirements are expected to increase substantially as we continue to advance our portfolio of programs.
Specifically, our expenses will increase if and as we:
•continue our current research programs and our preclinical development of product candidates from our current research programs;
•seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates;
•advance our existing and future product candidates into clinical development;
•initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates we identify and develop or expand development of existing programs into additional patient populations;
•maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual property portfolio and provide reimbursement of third-party expenses related to our patent portfolio;
•seek regulatory and marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that we develop;
•seek to identify, establish and maintain additional collaborations and license agreements, and the success of those collaborations and license agreements;
•make milestone payments to Beam under our collaboration and license agreement with Beam, to Acuitas under our non-exclusive license agreement with Acuitas, under the Harvard/ Broad License Agreements, and under any additional future collaboration or license agreements that we obtain;
•ultimately establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drug products for which we may obtain marketing approval, either by ourselves or in collaboration with others;
•generate revenue from commercial sales of product candidates we may develop for which we receive marketing approval;
•further develop our base editing technology;
•hire additional personnel including research and development, clinical and commercial personnel;
•add operational, financial and management information systems;
•add personnel including personnel to support our product development;
•acquire or in-license products, intellectual property, medicines and technologies;
•satisfy any post-marketing requirements, such as a cardiovascular outcomes trial;
•establish commercial-scale current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, capabilities through a third-party or our own manufacturing facility; and
•continue to operate as a public company.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $360.4 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of
products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Our expectation with respect to our ability to fund current planned operations is based on estimates that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to management and there can be no assurance that the current operating plan will be achieved in the time frame anticipated by us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not have any source of committed external funds. Market volatility could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. Additional capital raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, may include liquidation or other preferences. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, selling or licensing our assets, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual obligations
We lease certain assets under noncancelable operating leases, which expire through 2032. The leases relate primarily to office space and laboratory space. Our aggregate future minimum commitments under these office and laboratory leases were $108.8 million as of December 31, 2021, excluding any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. For additional information regarding these leases, refer to Note 7, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation.
We have also entered into license agreements under which we may be obligated to make certain payments. For example, in November 2021, we paid success payments of approximately $6.3 million to Broad and Harvard that were triggered under the Harvard/Broad License Agreement. If additional success payments are triggered, we would be obligated to pay Broad and Harvard up to an additional $25.0 million under the Harvard/Broad License Agreement. Our agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial and success payment milestones. Such payment obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known. For additional information about our license agreements and amounts that could become payable in the future under such agreements, see “Business-License and collaboration agreements” and Note 8, License agreements, to our consolidated financial statements.
Emerging growth company and smaller reporting company status
As an emerging growth company, or EGC, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for EGCs include presentation of only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement for an initial public offering, or IPO, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an EGC to delay the adoption of some
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
We may remain classified as an EGC until the end of the fiscal year until December 31, 2026, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more in any fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of December 31 of the applicable year. We also would cease to be an EGC if we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,, although we will cease to be a smaller reporting company in connection with the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2022. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations, such as an ability to provide simplified executive compensation information and only two years of audited financial statements in an annual report on Form 10-K, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments
This management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
•accrued research and development expenses;
•stock-based compensation and common stock valuation; and
•fair value measurements.
Accrued research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate certain accrued research and development expenses. This process involves estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include those related to fees paid to:
•vendors in connection with discovery and preclinical development activities;
•CROs in connection with preclinical studies and testing; and
•CMOs in connection with the process development and scale up activities and the production of materials.
We base the expense recorded related to contract research and manufacturing on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs and CMOs that conduct services and supply materials. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual
timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. While the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; some require advance payments. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. We record these as prepaid expenses on our consolidated balance sheet.
Stock-based compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, consultants or founders based upon their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
The stock-based compensation awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with service-based vesting and recognize stock-based compensation for performance awards based on grant date fair value over the service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses inputs such as the fair value of our common stock, assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-fee interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. The fair value of our common stock is used to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.
Prior to our IPO in June 2021, there was no public market for our common stock. As a result, prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of grant. Following our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
Fair value measurements
Antidilution rights liability
The antidilution rights liability represents the obligation to issue additional shares of common stock to Harvard and Broad following the completion of preferred stock financings and upon the closing of our IPO. These antidilution rights are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and were initially recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to research and development expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other income (expense) in the statement of operations at each reporting period. The antidilution rights liability was valued using (i) a probability-weighted present value model that considered the probability of meeting the defined aggregate level of preferred stock financing, as well as the fair value of our common stock and (ii) a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on several key variables, including probability of event occurrence, timing of event occurrence, as well as the fair value of our common stock.
The antidilution rights liability was partially satisfied in 2019 and 2020 and was satisfied in full upon the issuance of an aggregate of an additional 878,098 shares of common stock upon the closing of our IPO in June 2021.
Success payments liability
We are required to make success payments to Harvard and Broad in the event our average market capitalization, since the filing of our first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, exceeds specified thresholds ascending from a high nine digit dollar amount to $10.0 billion, or sale of our company for consideration in excess of those thresholds. In the event of a change of control of our company or a sale of our company, we are required to pay in cash within a specified period following such event. Otherwise, the payments may be settled at our option in either cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The success payments are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and were initially recorded at fair value with a
corresponding charge to research and development expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other income (expense) in the statement of operations. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the achievement or expiration of the success payment obligation. To determine the estimated fair value of the success payments, we used a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on several key variables, including probability of event occurrence, timing of event occurrence, as well as the value of our common stock.
