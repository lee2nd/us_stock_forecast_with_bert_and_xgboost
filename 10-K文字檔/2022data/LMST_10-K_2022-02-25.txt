Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Limestone Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Limestone Bank, Inc. (the “Bank”). The Company is a Louisville, Kentucky-based bank holding company that operates banking offices in 14 Kentucky counties. The Bank’s markets include metropolitan Louisville in Jefferson County and the surrounding counties of Bullitt and Henry. The Bank serves south central, southern, and western Kentucky from banking offices in Barren, Butler, Daviess, Edmonson, Green, Hardin, Hart, Ohio, and Warren Counties. The Bank also has an office in Lexington, the second largest city in the state, and Frankfort, the state capital. The Bank is a traditional community bank with a wide range of personal and business banking products and services.
Selected Consolidated Financial Data
(1)
In 2021, the Company recognized a $191,000 gain on the sale of OREO and a $465,000 gain on the call of a corporate bond from the Company’s available for sale securities portfolio.
(2)
On November 15, 2019, the Company completed a four branch acquisition. The purchase included $126.8 million in performing loans and $1.5 million in premises and equipment, as well as $131.8 million in customer deposits. Acquisition related costs totaled $775,000, or $0.08 per common share after taxes.
(3)
Effective January 1, 2021, the Commonwealth of Kentucky eliminated the bank franchise tax, which was previously reported as a non-interest expense, and implemented a state income tax at a statutory rate of 5%. State income tax was $939,000 for 2021. For 2020 and 2019, income tax expense benefitted $478,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, from the establishment of a net deferred tax asset related to a change in Kentucky tax law enacted during 2019. Income tax expense for 2017 benefitted $54.0 million from the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance offset by $20.3 million of income tax expense related to the revaluation of the deferred tax asset to 21%.
(4)
Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP based amounts. Tangible book value is calculated by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common stockholders’ equity. Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which is calculated by dividing common stockholders’ equity by common shares outstanding. Management believes this is consistent with bank regulatory agency treatment, which excludes tangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other schedules presented elsewhere in the report.
Overview
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported net income of $14.9 million compared with net income of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net income of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Basic and diluted income per common share were $1.96 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $1.20 for 2020, and $1.41 for 2019.
Net income before taxes was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Income tax expense was $4.6 million for 2021, $1.6 million for 2020, and $480,000 for 2019. Effective January 1, 2021, the Commonwealth of Kentucky eliminated the bank franchise tax, which was previously recorded as non-interest expense, and implemented a state income tax at a statutory rate of 5%. State income tax expense was $939,000 for 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $478,000 for 2020, and an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2019.
The following significant items are of note for the year ended December 31, 2021:
●
Average loans receivable decreased approximately $5.5 million, or 0.6%, to $958.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $964.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans averaged $15.5 million and $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. After forgiveness and paydowns, PPP loans declined to $1.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $20.3 million at December 31, 2020.
●
Net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.48% for the year ended 2021 compared with 3.36% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on earning assets decreased to 3.92% in 2021, compared to 4.20% in 2020. The yield on earning assets was negatively impacted by falling interest rates on the Bank’s fed funds, certain floating rate investment securities, loans with variable rate pricing features, and new loans originated in the lower interest rate environment, including PPP loans which carry a rate of 1.0%.
●
The negative impact of falling rates was offset by $2.8 million in fees earned on PPP loans during 2021, compared to $1.1 million during 2020. PPP fees during the year ended December 31, 2021 represented 21 basis points, compared to 10 basis points of earning asset yield and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.
●
The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.59% in 2021 from 1.05% in 2020 as a result of decreases in short-term interest rates during 2020, the continued downward repricing of deposits, and continued improvement in deposit mix.
●
A provision for loan losses of $1.2 million was recorded in 2021, compared to $4.4 million in 2020. The 2021 loan loss provision was attributable to net loan charge-offs impacting historical loss percentages and growth within the portfolio during the year, while the 2020 provision was largely attributable to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic related economic and business disruptions. Net loan charge-offs were $2.1 million for 2021, compared to net loan charge-offs of $333,000 for 2020, and net loan charge-offs of $504,000 for 2019.
●
Deposits were $1.21 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.12 billion at December 31, 2020. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $31.1 million, or 12.8%, to $274.1 million compared with $243.0 million at December 31, 2020. Interest checking accounts increased $96.6 million, or 50.7%, to $287.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $190.6 million at December 31, 2020. Money market accounts increased $42.2 million or 24.0% to $217.9 million compared with $175.8 million at December 31, 2020. Savings accounts increased $20.8 million, or 14.6%, to $163.4 million compared with $142.6 million at December 31, 2020. Certificate of deposit balances decreased $101.5 million, or 27.6%, to $266.0 million at December 31, 2021, from $367.6 million at December 31, 2020 due to liquidity management considerations and planned reduction in higher cost deposits.
●
On October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $3.0 million of the Company’s Common Shares over time. Subject to applicable rules and regulations, the shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Such purchases will be at times and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as availability of shares, market conditions, the trading price of the shares, the Company’s financial performance and liquidity, legal and regulatory capital requirements, and other business conditions. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of common shares, and it may be modified, terminated, or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The share repurchase program expires on December 31, 2022.
These items are discussed in further detail throughout this Item 7.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
The Company’s accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Management believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of management assumptions and judgments that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change.
Allowance for Loan Losses - The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance using, among other things, historical loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and current economic conditions and trends. The allowance may be allocated for specific loans or loan categories, but the entire allowance is also available for any loan. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually evaluated and measured for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative environmental factors. Management develops allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends. Allowance estimates are a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio applied to individual loans based on loan type. If the mix and amount of future charge-off percentages differ significantly from the assumptions used by management in making its determination, management may be required to materially increase its allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses, which could adversely affect results.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2021 compared with 2020:
NM: Not Meaningful
Net income of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $5.9 million from net income of $9.0 million for 2020. Net interest income increased $3.6 million for 2021 as a result of $1.7 million in increased PPP fee recognition connected to the forgiveness and payoff of PPP loans, partially offset by declining yields on earning assets, and a $4.5 million decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to downward repricing within the time deposit portfolio, and a reduction in the size of the time deposit portfolio. Provision for loan losses of $1.2 million was recorded in 2021, compared to a $4.4 million provision for loan losses in 2020. The 2021 loan loss provision was attributable to net loan charge-offs impacting historical loss percentages and growth trends within the portfolio during the year, while the provision for 2020 was largely attributable to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic related economic and business disruptions.
Non-interest income increased $1.6 million during 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in bank card interchange fees of $740,000 as a result of an increase in debit card transactions, a $191,000 gain on the sale of OREO, and a $465,000 gain on the call of a corporate bond from the Bank’s available for sale securities portfolio.
Non-interest expense decreased $445,000 during 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $1.1 million in deposit and state franchise tax expense as a result of the elimination of the Kentucky bank franchise tax discussed below. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $381,000 attributable to moderate merit increases in compensation and performance-based incentive compensation partially offset in 2021 by year over year average FTE reductions. Additionally, deposit account related expense increased $268,000 due to an increase in debit card transactions and the related processing costs.
Income tax expense was $4.6 million and $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Effective January 1, 2021, the Commonwealth of Kentucky eliminated the bank franchise tax and implemented a state income tax at a statutory rate of 5%. State income tax expense was $939,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a state income tax benefit of $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the establishment of a net deferred tax asset due to the tax law change.
The following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2020 compared with 2019:
Net income of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $1.5 million from net income of $10.5 million for 2019. Net interest income increased $5.3 million for 2020 as a result of PPP fee recognition of $1.1 million connected to the forgiveness and payoff of PPP loans and a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities due to downward repricing within the time deposit portfolio, as well as a reduction in the size of the time deposit portfolio. A provision for loan losses of $4.4 million was recorded in 2020, compared to no provision for loan losses expense in 2019. The 2020 loan loss provision was attributable to the net loan charge-offs during the year, trends within the portfolio during the year, and primarily to changes in the economic and business environment attributable to COVID-19.
Non-interest income increased $926,000 during 2020. There was an increase of $938,000 in bank card interchange fees, primarily as a result of the deposit accounts acquired in the branch purchase transaction.
Non-interest expense increased $2.1 million during 2020 due primarily to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.5 million, $666,000 in deposit account related expense, and $479,000 in occupancy expense. The Bank added sales talent and customer facing associates during the latter half of 2019 and branch staff in connection with its purchase of four branches in November 2019. These increases were muted somewhat by efforts in 2020 to reduce FTEs from 248 at March 31, 2020 to 219 as of December 31, 2020 through attrition and workforce reduction. The increase in deposit account related expense and occupancy expense is the result of the branch purchase transaction.
Income tax expense for 2020 and 2019 benefitted $478,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, from the establishment of a state net deferred tax asset related to the 2019 tax law enactments. The new laws eliminate the Kentucky bank franchise tax, which is assessed at a rate of 1.1% of average capital, and implements a state income tax for the Bank at a statutory rate of 5%. The new Kentucky income tax went into effect on January 1, 2021.
Net Interest Income - The interest rate environment changed in a downward direction in early 2020 as the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points on March 6, 2020 and 100 basis points on March 15, 2020. In particular, the Federal Reserve’s actions served to lower rates on the short end of the yield curve impacting yields on fed funds, certain floating rate investment securities, loans with variable rate pricing features, and the production rates for new loan originations.
Net interest income was $44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.6 million, or 8.9%, compared with $40.6 million for the same period in 2020. Net interest spread and margin were 3.33% and 3.48%, respectively, for 2021, compared with 3.15% and 3.36%, respectively, for 2020.
The yield on earning assets decreased to 3.92% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 4.20% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the lower interest rate environment. Average interest-earning assets increased $67.4 million during 2021 primarily attributable to an increase in investment securities. Average loans decreased approximately $5.5 million during 2021. PPP loans averaged $15.5 million and $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest revenue in 2021 declined $390,000 due to lower interest rates on new and renewed loans, the downward repricing of variable rate loans, and lower rates on securities purchased over the past eight quarters, as compared to 2020. Total interest income decreased 1.7%, or $838,000, in 2021 compared to 2020.
Loan fee income can meaningfully impact net interest income, loan yields, and net interest margin. The amount of loan fee income included in total interest income was $4.3 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This represents 33 basis points of yield on earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 18 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. Loan fee income for 2021 included $2.8 million in fees earned on PPP loans, compared to $1.1 million in 2020, which represents 21 basis points and 10 basis points of earning asset yield and net interest margin for those years, respectively.
The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 1.05% for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily based on downward repricing of time and other interest-bearing deposits and reduction in the size of the time deposit portfolio, as well as a shift in deposit mix. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $4.1 million during 2021 primarily due to a $13.9 million decrease in FHLB advances. Total interest expense decreased by 43.9% to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, time deposits comprise $266.0 million of the Company’s liabilities with $161.9 million, or 61%, set to reprice or mature within one year of which, $55.0 million with a current average rate of 0.33% reprice or mature within the first quarter of 2022.
Net interest income was $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.3 million, or 14.9%, compared with $35.4 million for the same period in 2019. Net interest spread and margin were 3.15% and 3.36%, respectively, for 2020, compared with 3.10% and 3.40%, respectively, for 2019.
The yield on earning assets decreased to 4.20% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 4.76% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on earning assets was negatively impacted by falling interest rates on the Bank’s fed funds, certain floating rate investment securities, loans with variable rate repricing features, and new loan production during the year. Average loans increased approximately $162.3 million during 2020. Average loans were positively impacted from the branch purchase transaction on November 15, 2019, along with loan growth during 2019 and 2020, as well as PPP loan originations. The increase in average loans resulted in an increase in interest revenue volume of approximately $7.9 million for 2020, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest revenue to due declining rates of $5.0 million, as compared to 2019. Loan fee income can meaningfully impact net interest income, loan yields, and net interest margin. The amount of loan fee income included in total interest income represents 18 basis points of yield on earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 11 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019. Loan fee income for 2020 included $1.1 million in fees earned on PPP loans. Total interest income increased 2.4%, or $1.2 million, for 2020 as compared 2019.
The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 1.05% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.66% for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily based on the downward repricing of time deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $106.3 million during 2020 due to deposit growth and the completion of the branch purchase transaction in 2019. Total interest expense decreased by 28.7% to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for 2020 was also impacted by the subordinated debt issuances and senior debt repayments in July 2019 and July 2020. As of December 31, 2020, time deposits comprise $367.6 million of the Company’s liabilities with $272.0 million, or 74%, set to reprice or mature within one year of which $104.9 million with a current average rate of 0.99% reprice or mature within the first quarter of 2021.

Rate/Volume Analysis
The table below sets forth information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume); (2) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate); and (3) changes in rate-volume (change in rate multiplied by change in volume). Changes in rate-volume are proportionately allocated between rate and volume variance.
Non-interest Income - The following table presents for the periods indicated the major categories of non-interest income:
Non-interest Income Comparison - 2021 to 2020
Non-interest income increased by $1.6 million for 2021 to $8.4 million compared with $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to bank card interchange fees of $740,000 as a result of an increase in debit card transactions, a $191,000 gain on the sale of OREO, and a $465,000 gain on the call of a corporate bond from the Bank’s available for sale securities portfolio.
Non-interest Income Comparison - 2020 to 2019
Non-interest income increased by $926,000 for 2020 to $6.8 million compared with $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to bank card interchange fees of $938,000 as a result of the deposit accounts acquired in the branch purchase transaction on November 15, 2019.
Non-interest Expense - The following table presents the major categories of non-interest expense:
Non-interest Expense Comparison - 2021 to 2020
Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $32.0 million represented a $445,000, or 1.4%, decrease from $32.4 million for 2020. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in deposit and state franchise tax expense as a result of the elimination of the Kentucky bank franchise tax discussed below. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $381,000 attributable to moderate merit increases in compensation and performance-based incentive compensation partially offset in 2021 by year over year average FTE reductions. Additionally, deposit account related expense increased $268,000 due to an increase in debit card transactions.
Non-interest Expense Comparison - 2020 to 2019
Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $32.4 million represented a $2.1 million, or 7.1%, increase from $30.3 million for 2019. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.5 million. The Bank added sales talent and customer facing associates during the latter half of 2019 and branch staff in connection with the branch purchase transaction in November 2019. These increases were muted somewhat by efforts in 2020 to reduce FTEs from 248 at March 31, 2020 to 219 as of December 31, 2020 through attrition and workforce reduction. Deposit account related expense increased by $666,000 and occupancy expense increased by $479,000 as a result of the branch purchase transaction. Franchise tax expense increased by $265,000 as a function of growth in the Bank’s taxable capital. These increases were offset by a decrease in OREO expenses of $305,000 due to lower valuation write-downs and operating expenses in 2020 compared to 2019. Non-interest expense for 2019 also included $775,000 of acquisition expenses associated with the branch purchase transaction.
Income Tax Expense - Effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate applied to income before income taxes due to the following:
Effective January 1, 2021, the Commonwealth of Kentucky eliminated the bank franchise tax, which was previously recorded as non-interest expense, and implemented a state income tax at a statutory rate of 5%. State income tax expense was $939,000 for 2021. For 2020 and 2019, income tax expense benefitted $478,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, from the establishment of a net deferred tax assets related to a change in Kentucky tax law enacted during 2019.
See Note 12, “Income Taxes”, to the financial statements for additional discussion of the Company’s income taxes.
Analysis of Financial Condition
Total assets at December 31, 2021 were $1.42 billion compared with $1.31 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $103.4 million or 7.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in investment securities of $56.8 million, as well as $40.7 million in net loans.
Total assets at December 31, 2020 were $1.31 billion compared with $1.25 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $66.5 million or 5.3%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loans of $31.7 million, as well as $34.9 million in interest-bearing deposits in banks.
Investment Securities - The securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk. Investments are made in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, corporate bonds, and collateralized loan obligations. The investment portfolio increased by $56.8 million, or 27.9%, to $260.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $203.9 million at December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Bank’s securities portfolio at the dates indicated.
During March 2021, to better manage interest rate risk, management changed the classification of all the municipal securities in the portfolio from available for sale (“AFS”) to held to maturity (“HTM”). These municipal securities had a book value of approximately $34.7 million, a market value of approximately $35.8 million, and a net unrealized gain of approximately $1.1 million. The transfer occurred at fair value. The related net unrealized gain included in other comprehensive income remained in other comprehensive income and is being amortized from other comprehensive income with an offsetting entry to interest income as a yield adjustment through earnings over the remaining term of the securities. No gain or loss was recorded at the time of transfer. This transfer was completed after careful consideration of the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
The Bank owns Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), which are debt securities secured by professionally managed portfolios of senior-secured loans to corporations. CLO are typically $300 million to $1 billion in size, contain one hundred or more loans and have five to six credit tranches with credit ratings ranging from AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B and equity tranche. Interest and principal are paid first to the AAA tranche then to the next lower rated tranche. Losses are borne first by the equity tranche then by the subsequently higher rated tranche. CLOs may be less liquid than government securities from time to time and volatility in the CLO market may cause the value of these investments to decline.
The market value of CLOs may be affected by, among other things, changes in composition of the underlying loans, changes in the cash flows from the underlying loans, defaults and recoveries on the underlying loans, capital gains and losses on the underlying loans, prepayments on the underlying loans, and other conditions or economic factors. At December 31, 2021, $30.0 million and $20.1 million of the Bank’s CLOs were risk rated AA and A rated, respectively. None of the CLOs were subject to ratings downgrade during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The corporate bond portfolio consists of 15 subordinated debt securities and two senior debt security of U.S. banks and bank holding companies with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2037. The securities are either initially fixed rate for five years converting to floating rate at an index over LIBOR or SOFR, or floating rate at an index over LIBOR or SOFR from inception. Management regularly monitors the financial condition of these corporate issuers by reviewing their regulatory and public filings.
The following table sets forth the contractual maturities, carrying values and weighted-average yields for the Bank’s investment securities held at December 31, 2021:
Average yields in the table above were calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages. These securities are issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as non-agency company issuers. These securities are deemed to have high credit ratings, and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest. Cash flows from agency backed mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the issuing agencies.
Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Mortgage-backed securities that are purchased at a premium will generally return decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages. Thus, the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period. Therefore, those securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the opposite will generally be true. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities generally do not experience increasing prepayments of principal and, consequently, average life will not be shortened. When interest rates fall, prepayments will generally increase. Non-agency issuer mortgage-backed securities do not carry a government guarantee. Management limits purchases of these securities to bank qualified issues with high credit ratings. At this time, there are no holdings of this type in the portfolio. At December 31, 2021, 84.5% of the Bank’s agency mortgage-backed securities had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted maturity of 22.3 years.
Loans Receivable - Loans receivable increased $39.8 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2021, to $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had $1.2 million in loans outstanding under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The Bank’s commercial and commercial real estate portfolios increased by an aggregate of $72.1 million, or 11.3%, during 2021 and comprised 70.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. The residential real and consumer portfolios decreased by an aggregate of $26.0 million, or 9.2%, during 2021 and comprised 25.5% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021.
Loans receivable increased $35.8 million, or 3.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2020, to $962.1 million. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $20.3 million in loans outstanding under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The Bank’s commercial and commercial real estate portfolios increased by an aggregate of $92.8 million, or 17.0%, during 2020 and comprised 66.3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.
Loan Portfolio Composition - The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated, net of deferred loan fees, by type. There are no foreign loans in the Bank’s portfolio and other than the categories noted, there is no concentration of loans in any industry exceeding 10% of total loans.
(1) Includes PPP loans of $1.2 million and $20.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state and federal law. The Bank’s statutory secured legal lending limit to a single borrower or guarantor was approximately $50.7 million at December 31, 2021 as measured at 30% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.
The Bank had 22 and 18 loan relationships each with aggregate extensions of credit in excess of $10.0 million at year end 2021 and 2020, respectively. The aggregate extension of credit to these relationships totaled $310.7 million and $217.6 million at year end 2021 and 2020, respectively. With respect to these large loan relationships, all 22 were classified as pass by the Bank’s internal loan review process at December 31, 2021 and 17 were classified as pass and one classified as watch at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the largest relationship totaled $27.4 million, of which, $17.2 million was secured by a multi-family development currently under construction, and $10.2 million was secured by a combination of commercial real estate currently under development and income producing commercial real estate.
As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had $85.2 million of loan participations purchased from, and $12.8 million of loan participations sold to, other banks. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $74.3 million of loan participations purchased from, and $21.3 million of loan participations sold to, other banks.
Loan Maturity Schedule - The following table sets forth at December 31, 2021, the dollar amount of loans, net of deferred loan fees, maturing in the loan portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity:
Loan Portfolio by Risk Category - The Bank follows a loan grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. Through this loan grading process, an internally classified watch list is maintained which helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In establishing the appropriate risk rating for loans, management considers, among other factors, the borrower’s ability to repay, the borrower’s repayment history, the current delinquency status, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, and the capacity and willingness of a guarantor to satisfy the obligation. As a result of this process, loans are categorized as pass, watch, special mention, substandard or doubtful.
Loans categorized as “watch” show warning elements where the present status exhibits one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short-term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened warranting more frequent monitoring. These loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan (substandard or doubtful), but show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit.
Loans classified as “special mention” do not have all of the characteristics of substandard or doubtful loans. They have one or more deficiencies that warrant special attention and which corrective action, such as accelerated collection practices, may remedy.
Loans classified as “substandard” are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position, unfavorable financial ratios, uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the repayment of the debt as contractually agreed. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Loans classified as “doubtful” are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable.
The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated, by risk category.
Loans receivable increased $39.8 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Since December 31, 2020, the pass category increased approximately $51.9 million, the watch category decreased approximately $11.0 million, and the substandard category decreased approximately $1.2 million. The $1.2 million decrease in loans classified as substandard was primarily driven by $4.5 million in principal payments received, $2.5 million in charge-offs, and $325,000 in loans upgraded from substandard, offset by $6.1 million in loans moved to substandard during 2021. These trends were considered during the evaluation of qualitative trends in the portfolio when establishing the general component of the allowance for loan losses.
Loan Delinquency - The following table presents a summary of loan delinquencies at the dates indicated.
The trend in delinquency levels is considered during the evaluation of qualitative trends in the portfolio when establishing the general component of the Bank’s allowance for loan losses.
Nonaccrual loans increased $1.4 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by $2.9 million in loans placed on non-accrual, offset by $1.3 million in paydowns and $203,000 in charge-offs. The $3.1 million in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 were primarily secured by commercial real estate loans. The $1.7 million in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 were generally secured by residential real estate loans. Management believes it has established adequate loan loss reserves for these credits.
Troubled Debt Restructuring - A troubled debt restructuring (TDR) occurs when the Bank has agreed to a loan modification in the form of a concession to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty. The Bank’s TDRs typically involve a reduction in interest rate, a deferral of principal for a stated period of time, or an interest only period. TDRs are considered to be impaired loans, and the Bank has allocated reserves for these loans to reflect the present value of the concessionary terms granted to the borrower. If the loan is considered collateral dependent, it is reported net of allocated reserves, at the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell.
The Bank generally does not have a formal loan modification program. If a borrower is unable to make contractual payments, management reviews the particular circumstances of that borrower’s situation and determine whether or not to negotiate a revised payment stream. The goal when restructuring a credit is to afford the borrower a reasonable period of time to remedy the issue causing cash flow constraints so that the credit may return to performing status over time. If a borrower fails to perform under the modified terms, the loan(s) are placed on nonaccrual status and collection actions are initiated.
At December 31, 2021, the Bank had three restructured loans totaling $405,000 with borrowers who experienced deterioration in financial condition compared with four restructured loans totaling $480,000 at December 31, 2020. In general, these loans were granted interest rate reductions to provide cash flow relief to borrowers experiencing cash flow difficulties. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bank had no restructured loans that had been granted principal payment deferrals until maturity. There were no concessions made to forgive principal relative to these loans, although partial charge-offs have been recorded for certain restructured loans. In general, these loans are secured by first liens on 1-4 residential properties or commercial real estate properties. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 84% and 100%, respectively, of the TDRs were performing according to their modified terms.
There was one modification granted during 2021 and 2020 that resulted in a loan being identified as TDRs. See “Note 3 - Loans,” to the financial statements for additional disclosure related to troubled debt restructuring.
Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19 - The Bank has elected to account for eligible loan modifications under Section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). To be an eligible loan under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020 concerning the COVID-19 outbreak (the “national emergency”) or (B) December 31, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (“Economic Aid Act”) extended eligible loan modifications under Section 4013 of the CARES Act from December 31, 2020 to January 1, 2022. Eligible loan modifications are not required to be classified as TDRs and will not be reported as past due provided that they are performing in accordance with the modified terms. Interest income will continue to be recognized in accordance with GAAP unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.
Loans subject to CARES Act modifications that had not returned to normal payment terms declined to $2.2 million as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $15.3 million at December 31, 2020. At the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bank had one remaining commercial real estate loan secured by a retail entertainment facility subject to a CARES Act modification. This loan totaled $4.4 million, had been graded substandard, evaluated under ASC -310-10, and allocated a specific reserve of $2.2 million since December 2020. Given the uncertainty of the borrower’s ability to return to amortizing principal and interest payments, this loan was placed on nonaccrual during the fourth quarter of 2021 and a partial charge-off of the specifically allocated $2.2 million reserve was recognized.
Non-Performing Assets - Non-performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated, loans past due 90 days or more still on accrual, loans on which interest is no longer accrued, real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets. Loans, including impaired loans, are placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection. Loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan. If the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds 120 days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not agreed to with the borrower, management institutes measures to remedy the default, including commencing a foreclosure action. Consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible and often before any available collateral has been disposed. Commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis, generally with the advice of legal counsel.
Interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans placed on nonaccrual status. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes, after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrowers’ financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful, which typically occurs after the loan becomes 90 days delinquent. When interest accrual is discontinued, existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received on well-secured loans.
Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. New and used automobiles and other motor vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold. When such property is acquired it is recorded at its fair market value less cost to sell. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent gains and losses are included in non-interest expense.
The following table sets forth information with respect to non-performing assets as of the dates indicated:
Interest income that would have been recorded if nonaccrual loans were on a current basis in accordance with their original terms was $287,000, $288,000, and $315,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021, were $3.5 million, or 0.35% of total loans, at December 31, 2021, and $2.2 million, or 0.22% of total loans, at December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Provision for Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is established to provide for probable losses on loans that may not be fully repaid. It is based on management’s continuing review and evaluation of individual loans, loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various categories of loans and such other factors that, in management’s judgment, require current recognition in estimating loan losses. Based on its assessment of the loan portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the Bank’s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance for loan losses since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. This assessment is an estimate and is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as events change.
Management utilizes loan grading procedures that result in specific allowance allocations for the estimated risk of loss. For loans not individually evaluated, a general allowance allocation is computed using factors developed over time based on actual loss experience. The specific and general allocations plus consideration of qualitative factors represent management’s estimate of probable losses contained in the loan portfolio at the evaluation date. Although the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific and general allocations, the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses.
A significant portion of the portfolio is comprised of loans secured by real estate. A decline in the value of the real estate serving as collateral for loans may impact the Bank’s ability to collect those loans. In general, management obtains updated appraisals on property securing the Bank’s loans when circumstances are warranted such as at the time of renewal or when market conditions have significantly changed. Management uses qualified licensed appraisers approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. These appraisers possess prerequisite certifications and knowledge of the local and regional marketplace.
General Reserve - A general reserve is maintained for each loan type in the loan portfolio. In determining the amount of the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses, management considers factors such as the Bank’s historical loan loss experience, the growth, composition and diversification of its loan portfolio, current delinquency levels, loan quality grades, the results of recent regulatory examinations, and general economic conditions. Based on these factors, management applies estimated loss percentages to the various categories of loans, not including any loan that has a specific allowance allocated to it.
Specific Reserve - A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Bank will not receive all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan has been identified as impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with ASC 310-10, “Impairment of a Loan.” Generally, all loans identified as impaired are reviewed individually on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific allowance is required. Additionally, specific reserves may be carried for accruing TDRs in compliance with restructured terms. When management’s measured value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the amount of the impairment is recorded as a specific reserve or charged-off if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. Loans for which specific reserves have been provided are excluded from the general reserve calculations described above.
The following table sets forth an analysis of loan loss experience as of and for the periods indicated:
The loan loss reserve, as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2021, was 1.15% compared to 1.29% at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 332.88% at December 31, 2021, compared with 577.13% at December 31, 2020.
At the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bank had one remaining commercial real estate loan secured by a retail entertainment facility that remained subject to an eligible loan modification under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. This loan totaled $4.4 million, had been graded substandard, evaluated under ASC-310-10, and allocated a specific reserve of $2.2 million since December 2020. Given the uncertainty of the borrower’s ability to return to amortizing principal and interest payments, this loan was placed on nonaccrual during the fourth quarter of 2021 and a partial charge-off of the specifically allocated $2.2 million reserve was recognized. The remaining balance of this loan was $2.2 million at December 31, 2021. Net loan charge-offs were $2.1 million for 2021, compared to net loan charge-offs of $333,000 in 2020 and net loan charge-offs of $504,000 in 2019.
A provision for loan losses of $1.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to provision for loan losses of $4.4 million for 2020, and no provision for loan losses for 2019. The 2021 loan loss provision was attributable to net loan charge-offs impacting historical loss percentages and growth trends within the portfolio during the year, while the provision for 2020 was largely attributable to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic related economic and business disruptions.
While the U.S. Government’s economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic through monetary policy and fiscal stimulus have provided meaningful support to the economy, management deemed it prudent to continue to maintain its qualitative environmental factor in the allowance for loan losses to account for the continued uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table depicts management’s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type based on the factors previously discussed. Since these factors and management’s assumptions are subject to change, the allocation is not necessarily predictive of future portfolio performance. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans.
Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses
Foreclosed Properties - There were no foreclosed properties at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.8 million at December 31, 2020. See “Note 6 - Other Real Estate Owned,” to the financial statements.
OREO is recorded at fair market value less estimated cost to sell at time of acquisition. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. When foreclosed properties are acquired, management obtains a new appraisal or has staff from the Bank’s special assets group evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to OREO. Management typically obtains updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent. Subsequent reductions in fair value are recorded as non-interest expense when a new appraisal indicates a decline in value or in cases where a listing price is lowered below the appraisal amount.
Net activity relating to OREO during the years indicated is as follows:
There were no acquisitions of OREO during 2021 or 2020. The Bank sold properties totaling $2.0 million and $1.6 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no fair value write-downs recorded during 2021 or 2020. Fair value write-downs of $260,000 were recorded in 2019. Fair value write-downs reflect updated appraisals, changes in marketing strategies, or reductions in listing prices for certain properties. The Bank recognized gain on sales of OREO of $191,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to no gain on sales of OREO during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Certain nonaccrual loans may be resolved through the acquisition and sale of the underlying real estate collateral.
Operating expenses for OREO totaled $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with operating expenses of $63,000 in 2020, and write-downs and operating expenses of $368,000 in 2019.
Deposits - The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates.
The Bank primarily relies on its banking office network to attract and retain deposits in its local markets, as well as deposit listing services, deposit gathering networks, and the online channel to attract both in and out-of-market deposits. Market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect the Bank’s ability to attract and retain deposits. During 2021, total deposits increased $89.1 million compared with 2020. The increase in deposits for 2021 was primarily in interest-bearing demand deposit account balances, as well as money market and non-interest demand deposit accounts. During 2020, total deposits increased $92.6 million compared with 2019. The increase in deposits for 2020 was primarily in savings account balances, as well as non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts.
The Bank continues to offer attractively priced deposit products along its product line to allow it to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during various rising and falling interest rate cycles. The Bank offers savings accounts, interest checking accounts, money market accounts and fixed rate certificates with varying maturities. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. Management adjusts interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties on the Bank’s deposit products periodically. The variety of deposit products allows the Bank to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into outside investment alternatives. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits at acceptable rates will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.
The following table sets forth the average daily balances and weighted average rates paid for deposits for the periods indicated:
The following table shows at December 31, 2021 the amount of the Bank’s time deposits of $250,000 or more by time remaining until maturity:
The Bank maintains competitive pricing on its deposit products, which management believes allows it to retain a substantial percentage of the Bank’s customers when their time deposits mature.
Borrowing - Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending activities, investment activities, and for general business purposes. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Cincinnati to supplement the pool of lendable funds, meet deposit withdrawal requirements and manage the terms of liabilities. FHLB borrowings are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB, substantially all of its first mortgage residential loans, as well as its outstanding PPP loans. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had $20.0 million in outstanding borrowings from the FHLB and the capacity to increase borrowings by an additional $62.5 million. The FHLB of Cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to borrow on the security of such stock and certain of its home mortgages and other assets (principally, securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided that it meets certain standards related to creditworthiness.
The following table sets forth information about the Bank’s FHLB borrowings as of and for the periods indicated:
Junior Subordinated Debentures - At December 31, 2021, the Company had four issues of junior subordinated debentures outstanding totaling $21.0 million as shown in the table below.
(1)
As of December 31, 2021, the 3-month LIBOR was 0.21%.
The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption at the liquidation preference. The subordinated debentures are redeemable before the maturity date at the Company’s option at their principal amount plus accrued interest.
The Company has the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. A deferral period may begin at the Company’s discretion so long as interest payments are current. At December 31, 2021, the Company is current on all interest payments.
The Federal Reserve Board rules allow trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 to be included in Tier 1 capital, subject to quantitative and qualitative limits. Currently, no more than 25% of the Company’s Tier 1 capital can consist of trust preferred securities and qualifying perpetual preferred stock. To the extent the amount of the Company’s trust preferred securities exceeds the 25% limit, the excess would be includable in Tier 2 capital. As of December 31, 2021, all of the Company’s trust preferred securities were included in and comprised 17% of Tier 1 capital.
Each of the trusts issuing the trust preferred securities holds junior subordinated debentures issued with an original maturity of 30 years. In the last five years before the junior subordinated debentures mature, the associated trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital and included in Tier 2 capital. In addition, the trust preferred securities during this five-year period are amortized out of Tier 2 capital by one-fifth each year and excluded from Tier 2 capital completely during the year before maturity.
Subordinated Capital Notes - The Company’s subordinated notes mature on July 31, 2029. The notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% until July 30, 2024 and then convert to variable at three-month LIBOR plus 395 basis points until maturity. The subordinated capital notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital. On July 31, 2020, the Company completed the issuance of an additional $8.0 million in subordinated notes under the July 23, 2019 indenture with the same terms and with the additional commitment by the Company to extend the optional prepayment date to July 31, 2025 so long as the additional notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital. The Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of the additional notes to retire its senior debt and retained the remaining balance for general corporate purposes. The subordinated capital notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital.
Capital
Stockholders’ equity increased $14.9 million to $131.0 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $116.0 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to current year net income of $14.9 million.
The following table shows the ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital, total capital to risk-adjusted assets, and Tier 1 leverage for the Bank at December 31, 2021:
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in discretionary actions by regulators that, if taken, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.
The Basel III rules require a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum Basel III levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions without prior regulatory approval.
Liquidity and Capital Resource Management
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Company meets the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as operating cash needs, taking into account all on- and off-balance sheet funding demands. Liquidity risk management also involves ensuring that cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost. Management maintains an investment and funds management policy, which identifies the primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance. The Asset Liability Committee regularly monitors and reviews the Company’s liquidity position.
Funds are available to the Bank from a number of sources, including the sale of securities in the available for sale investment portfolio, principal pay-downs on loans and mortgage-backed securities, customer deposit inflows, and other wholesale funding.
The Bank also borrows from the FHLB to supplement funding requirements. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had an unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $62.5 million. Advances are collateralized by first mortgage residential loans, as well as its outstanding PPP loans. Borrowing capacity is based on the underlying book value of eligible pledged loans.
The Bank also has available on an unsecured basis federal funds borrowing line from a correspondent bank totaling $5.0 million. Management believes the sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future. Historically, the Bank has also utilized brokered and wholesale deposits to supplement its funding strategy. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had no brokered deposits.
The Company uses cash on hand to service the subordinated capital notes, junior subordinated debentures, and to provide for operating cash flow needs. The Company’s primary source of funding to meet its obligations is dividends from the Bank. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was eligible to pay $6.5 million of dividends. The Bank paid the Company $2.0 million of dividends during 2021.
Additionally, the Company also may issue common equity, preferred equity and debt to support cash flow needs and liquidity requirements.
Material Cash Requirements and Obligations
The following table summarizes key obligations by maturity date or scheduled payment date and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2021:
(1) Fixed rate borrowing at 0.77%, maturing in 2030, and callable quarterly at the option of the FHLB.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Bank enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
The commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2021 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the Bank’s actual future cash funding requirements:
Commitments to Extend Credit - The Bank enters into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of the Bank’s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon borrowers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. The Bank minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures.
Standby Letters of Credit - Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments the Bank issues to guarantee the performance of a borrower to a third party. If the borrower does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Bank may be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Bank could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, the Bank would be entitled to seek recovery from the borrower.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
The Bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates, and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates. As market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on loans and investments, the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively. Inflation can also impact core non-interest expenses associated with delivering the Bank’s services.
