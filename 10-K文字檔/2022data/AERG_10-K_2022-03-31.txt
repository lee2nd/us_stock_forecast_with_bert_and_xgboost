ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A and with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere herein.
Overview
Applied Energetics, Inc., specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers, high voltage electronics, advanced optical systems, and integrated guided energy systems for prospective defense, national security, industrial, and scientific customers worldwide.
Gregory J. Quarles serves as our President and Chief Executive officer and, pursuant to a consulting agreement with an LLC wholly owned by him, Dr. Stephen W. McCahon serves as our Chief Scientist. AERG has continued to expand its technical capabilities with the addition of employees, consultants and contractors, and agreements with several of the leading laser and optics universities in the country. The team at Applied Energetics continued to expand during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and early 2022, with the addition of two new full-time employees (one, a laser technician and the other a junior scientist and in-house counsel as well as retention of world-class contractors to strengthen our human resources, compliance, public relations, IT, and technical staff supporting the research and development in the laboratory.
AERG owns intellectual property that is integral and necessary for the development of Ultrashort Pulse (“USP™”) Lasers, Laser Guided Energy (“LGE®”) and Direct Discharge Electrical products for military and commercial applications. AERG currently owns 26 patents and an additional 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). These GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government and allow the company greatly extended protection rights, including having no expiration date until such time as they are no longer classified after that they will have the normal 20-year patent protection. The company also has seven provisional patents, and we continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate.
We submitted multiple proposals to various government agencies in 2020 and 2021. Due to the closures of multiple agencies and work-from-home orders across various regions of the United States, reviews and funding decisions on these proposals were delayed longer than anticipated as resources were focused on other matters within the government. AERG has received multiple notices from government agencies stating that “the vast number of proposals received, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the Government’s evaluation timelines.” Several of the government agencies that have received and are reviewing our proposals started to open their facilities to limited off-site briefings starting on June 1, 2021. Since that date, AERG’s team has been invited to, and completed, multiple briefings focused on our capabilities and our submissions. This positive action by the agencies could be impacted by the new Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of the SARS-CoV-2 strain. The Federal government is currently evaluating the possibility of reducing staff sizes in the offices and closing off all external visitors unless the meetings are deemed critical by the agency. Effective August 2, 2021, the DOD re-enforced a maximum telework position for their employees and contractors and reduced the on-site occupancy to less than 50% of the normal occupancy. As the Delta variant increased, the DOD maintained the maximum telework policy and on September 9, 2021 reduced the maximum on-site occupancy to less than 40% of normal work occupancy. Further restrictions were announced on January 6, 2022, with maximum occupancy of facilities dropping to 25%, and a majority of workers teleworking, but in March 2022, the DOD has announced that occupancy is back to 50% except in certain circumstances. These recent changes have again further hampered the ability of the AERG team to schedule on-site briefings for our proposals undergoing review.
In addition to these review-based delays, the US federal budget for 2022 was not approved by Congress by the October 1, 2021, start of the U.S. federal government fiscal year. On September 21, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5305, and on September 30, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the same bill, a continuing resolution (CR) to extend federal government funding through December 3, 2021, and the President signed it into law (Public Law 117-43) on September 30, 2021 to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year 2021. A second CR was signed into law on December 2, 2021, extending funded operations through February 18, 2022. And most recently, a third CR was signed on February 17, 2022, extending funding through March 11, 2022. The final appropriations bill was signed into law by President Biden on the night of March 11, 2022, and includes increases in areas of particular interest to the company.
In May 2021, we moved into our new headquarters consisting of approximately 13,000 rentable square feet of office, laboratory and production space located at the University of Arizona Tech Park, a research and technology park owned and operated by the University of Arizona. This has enabled us to consolidate our offices and expand our R&D capacity with a Class 1000 (ISO Class 6) “clean room” and other turnkey laboratory and conference features. We have consolidated from our two previous locations and now have our management and scientific teams under one roof. We also hosted our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the large University of Arizona Tech Park Conference Center, which provided the necessary equipment and refreshments. Attendees at the meeting received tours of the tech park grounds. We entered into the Lease Agreement for the space, effective March 15, 2021, with Campus Research Corporation. The lease term began May 1, 2021, and ends on April 30, 2026. The base rent is $6.7626 per rentable square foot for year one, and escalates to $9.2009 in year two, $11.4806 in year three, $13.1740 in year four and $14.9306 in year five, plus certain operating expenses and taxes.
On April 28, 2020, AERG was awarded a loan for $132,760 through the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The terms of this loan were twenty-four months with a 1% annual interest rate. These funds were issued to cover payroll costs over 8 weeks of May and June 2020. Through the utilization of this PPP loan, AERG was able to keep all employees fully engaged during these two months of the pandemic. Having followed the guidelines set forth by the SBA on the PPP program, we received a waiver which allowed for the conversion of $80,593.55 of the loan to a grant. Since then, we have been repaying the balance of the loan in monthly installments at the 1% annual interest rate. As of December 31, 2021, $22,804 in principal and $1,385 in interest remained outstanding, and we expect to repay the remaining balance in April 2022.
Strategic Plan and Analysis
Our goal with the AERG Strategic Plan is to increase the energy, peak power and frequency agility of USP optical sources while decreasing the size, weight, and cost of these systems. We are in the process of developing this breadth of very high peak power USP lasers and additional optical sources that have a very broad range of applicability for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and for commercial, biomedical, space and national intelligence applications. Although the historical market for AERG’s USP technology is the U.S. Government, derivatives of these USP technologies could provide future platforms for commercial additive and subtractive manufacturing and medical device and imaging markets, creating larger dual-use market for our products to address once testing, evaluation and integration have been completed in partnerships with the user community. During 2020, the AERG team was able to develop partnership and teaming arrangements with the three leading laser and optics institutes in the United States, namely, the University of Arizona, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Our desire is to work on programs jointly where the strengths of each organization can assist in escalating knowledge and delivery of systems to the government sponsors, and to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the Directed Energy fields.
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to present risks and uncertainties that may alter or otherwise affect our path forward. Although the virus seemed to be waning in the fall of 2021, the onslaught of the Omicron variant brought about a new wave that saw the seven-day moving average of new cases peak at around 466,000 during the winter of 2021-22. This variant, which presented with less severe symptoms on average than those before it, seems now to have receded. However, it is impossible to be certain whether a new variant will arise, its level of infectiousness and severity, and how it will affect commerce and our economy. Accordingly, our management continues to monitor the possible effects of the virus on the execution of our plan of operations, our prospective contracts, and the availability of financing to fund our strategic and operational plans going forward. We attempt to follow the most current advice and guidance to minimize the risk of infection to our employees and follow any applicable federal guidelines.
Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we have continued to execute our business development plans, further our research and development program and submit proposals for grants and contracts. During the past two fiscal years, we submitted multiple proposals and have been engaged in meetings on a daily and weekly basis with various agencies and departments both remotely and in person in Washington, DC and at various other government facilities. Dr. Quarles, our President and CEO, has traveled to DC on multiple occasions during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and currently in 2022 and remains committed to pursuing this business even in these challenging times. The interest in our technology and applications remains high, and we continue to submit proposals for all appropriate opportunities and share our vision of the disruptive capabilities of USP optical sources for both near- and far-term threats and dual-use commercial applications.
Through our analysis of the market, and in discussions with potential customers, we would also conclude that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in directed energy technologies. According to the Department of Defense fiscal 2019 budget, its directed energy spending grew from approximately $500 million in 2017 to over $1 billion in 2019, an increase of 100%. The 2020 budget reflected directed energy spending of $1.2 billion, an additional increase of 20% over 2019, and from 2017 through 2020, the directed energy budget grew from approximately $500 million to approximately $1.2 billion, averaging approximately 40% per year. The government has allocated $1.4 billion for various directed energy programs in 2021, and it has been anticipated to exceed $10.1 billion by 2026. The DOD budget for directed energy was essentially flat between 2021 and 2022, approaching $1.2 billion for each year. As a result, we continue to be even more optimistic about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications. The AERG team anticipates a continuation of strong funding for the Directed Energy community. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies, we believe we have the substantial building blocks needed to become a significant and successful developer in our USP™ and LGE® marketplaces.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other inputs and estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, management considers the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates, the trends in and amounts of these estimates, specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates, and any other relevant matters related to these estimates, including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.
Share-Based Payments
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. We make the following assumptions relative to this model: (i) the annual dividend yield is zero as we do not pay dividends on our common stock, (ii) the weighted-average expected life is based on a midpoint scenario, where the expected life is determined to be half of the time from grant to expiration, regardless of vesting, (iii) the risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security rate for the expected life, and (iv) the volatility is based on the level of fluctuations in our historical share price for a period equal to the weighted-average expected life. We estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and adjust this estimate over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative adjustment, which is recognized in the period of change and which impacts the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized currently for the future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
Results of Operations
Our consolidated financial information for the years ending December 31, 2021, and 2020 is as follows:
Revenue
Revenue decreased approximately $176,000 to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $176,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the completion of an STTR phase I project during 2020.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue decreased approximately $154,000 to $0 for year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $154,000 for year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the completion of an STTR phase I project.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $204,000 to $4,903,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $4,699,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the $154,000 in applied project costs in 2020, increases in building costs by $278,000, wages and employee benefits of $90,000, supplies and insurance of $22,000, travel of $14,000, partially offset by a decrease in consulting and professional services by approximately $356,000.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and Marketing expenses increased approximately $21,000 to $317,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $296,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the continuation of business development activities through our Master Services Agreement with Westpark Advisors as well as the addition of other consultants in this field.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased approximately $15,000 to $282,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $267,000 the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the additional labor being performed on our Internal Research and Development project, partially offset by the allocation of part of management’s pay from research and development to consulting expense.
Other Expense
Other income/(expense) decreased approximately $1,932,000 to $77,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2,009,000 for the year ended December 31. 2020, primarily due to the company receiving $3,206,000 in a litigation settlement during 2020. Interest expense decreased by approximately $1,208,000 to $4,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,213,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the amortization of the note’s payable beneficial conversion feature. Other income increased approximately $65,000 to $81,000 for the year ended 2021, compared to $16,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due the CARES Act PPP Loan forgiveness for $81,000.
Net Loss
Our operations in 2021 resulted in a net loss of approximately $5,425,000, a decrease of approximately $2,195,000 compared to the approximately $3,230,000 net loss for 2020 primarily due to the receipt of a ligation settlement, a decrease in consulting and professional services and applied project costs, partially offset by an increase due to the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature, increases in employee wages and benefits, building costs and supplies and insurance, selling and marketing. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share - basic and diluted decreased to approximately ($0.03) per share.
Trend Discussion
There are obvious costs associated with restarting the corporation and acquiring the skilled leadership and manpower to execute on new product development, as is visible in the higher year-over-year expenses recognized in this Result of Operations. It appears with early 2021 contract booking and the combination of the government slow-down due to COVID-19 impacts that it is too early to determine if efforts to obtain new business under our Teaming and Consulting Agreements could be successful for the next fiscal year. The AERG team has expanded teaming arrangements in 2021, with agreements signed with the three most prominent optics and laser universities in the United States. This should provide greater visibility to government agencies looking for submissions with university/industry partnerships and research alignment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the company incurred a net loss of approximately $5,425,000, had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $3,214,000 and may incur additional future losses due to the reduction in Government contract activity. At December 31, 2021, the Company had total current assets of approximately $3,706,000 and total current liabilities of approximately $1,416,000 resulting in working capital of approximately $2,290,000. At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash of approximately $3,663,000.
Based on the Company’s current business plan, it believes its cash balance as of the date of this filing will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that the current business plan will be achievable. Such conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued.
The company’s existence is dependent upon management’s ability to develop profitable operations. Management is devoting substantially all of its efforts to developing its business and raising capital and there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts will be successful. No assurance can be given that management’s actions will result in profitable operations or the resolution of its liquidity problems. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic contributes to this uncertainty.
In order to improve the company’s liquidity, the company’s management is actively pursuing additional equity financing through discussions with investment bankers and private investors. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its effort to secure additional equity financing.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amount or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3,663,000 cash and cash equivalents, an increase of approximately $339,000 from December 31, 2020. In 2021, we used approximately $3,214,000 in operating activities, comprised primarily of our net loss of $5,425,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses and deposits of $60,000, an increase in accounts payable of $43,000, an increase in accrued interest of $1,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $21,000, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1,237,000, amortization of future compensation payable of $833,000, amortization of prepaid assets of $157,000 and depreciation and amortization of $20,000.
We had approximately $3,760,000 provided by financing activities comprised of $5,299,000 provided from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $108,000 provided from the proceeds from the exercise of warrants, partially offset by the repayment on notes payable $1,647,000. All this resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately $3,760,000. There were no cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2021.
As of March 30, 2022, our backlog (that is, workload remaining on signed contracts) was approximately $-0- to be completed within the next twelve months.
As of March 30, 2022, the company had a cash balance of $2,750,000.
Contractual Obligations:
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2021:
The above table does not include the dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock. Assuming that there is no conversion of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock, the dividends are approximately $34,000 each year (approximately $9,000 each quarter).
Leases
In March 2021, the Company signed a five-year lease for a 11,000 square foot laboratory/office space in Tucson. The lease term commences May 1, 2021 and ends on April 30, 2026. The base rent is $6.7626 per rentable square foot for year one, and escalates to $9.2009 in year two, $11.4806 in year three, $13.1740 in year four and $14.9306 in year five, plus certain operating expenses and taxes.
Preferred Stock
The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock bears dividends at an initial rate of 6.5% of the liquidation preference per share per annum, which accrues from the date of issuance, and is payable quarterly. We have not paid dividends commencing with the quarterly dividend due August 1, 2013 and, as a result, the dividend rate has increased to 10% per annum and will remain at that level until such failure is cured. Dividends due as of December 31, 2021, and February 28, 2022, were approximately $295,000 and $298,000, respectively.
The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have a right to put the stock to the company for an aggregate amount equal to the liquidation preference (approximately $340,000) plus unpaid dividends of $295,000, as of December 31, 2021, in the event of a change in control. Dividends are payable in: (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock (valued for such purpose at 95% of the weighted average of the last sales prices of our common stock for each of the trading days in the ten trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the applicable dividend payment date), provided that the issuance and/or resale of all such shares of our common stock are then covered by an effective registration statement or (iii) any combination of the foregoing. As of December 31, 2021, there were 13,602 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.
