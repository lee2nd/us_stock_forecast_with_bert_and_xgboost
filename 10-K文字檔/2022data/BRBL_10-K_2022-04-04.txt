Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenues:
The Company’s revenues were $307,171 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $342,283 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The company has a strong relationship with DirecTV and has focused its efforts on expanding services outside of the San Francisco metropolitan area. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had one major customer who represented approximately 53% of total revenue. The decrease in revenue is due to a decrease in customer sales and a reduction in sales efforts due to COVID-19.
Cost of Sales:
The Company’s cost of sales was $11,415 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $7,821 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This is due to a higher number of audio/video equipment sales that were sold during the period ending December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.
Operating Expenses:
Operating expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, professional fees, salaries and wages, share based compensation, office expenses and fees associated with preparing reports and SEC filings relating to being a public company. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, were $7,538,628 and $1,097,216, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in share based compensation, employee wages and general and administrative expenses.
Other Income (Expense):
Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $383,880 and $(10,695,568), respectively. Other income (expense) consisted of derivative valuation gains and losses, gains or losses on settlement of debt and conversion of debt, and interest expense. The gain or loss on derivative valuation is directly attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative liability. Interest expense is primarily attributable to interest and penalties on outstanding notes payable, the initial interest expense associated with the valuation of derivative instruments at issuance, and the accretion of the convertible debentures over their respective terms. The increase in other income primarily resulted from the fluctuation of the Company’s stock price which impacted the valuation of the derivative liabilities.
Net Loss:
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,858,992 compared to $11,458,322 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net loss can be explained by the changes in the loss in the fair value of derivative liabilities.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that the rate of inflation has had a negligible effect on our operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The overall working capital (deficit) decreased from $(9,433,709) at December 31, 2020 to $(3,836,786) at September 30, 2021 due to the change in value of derivative liabilities, an increase in fixed assets and related party deposits paid for brewery equipment.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(529,635) compared to $(151,660) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the cash used in operating activities is primarily attributed to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, stock based compensation and loss on conversion.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(559,119) compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in cash used in investing activities is due to a related party deposit paid to begin fabrication of a brewery system and fixed asset additions.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash (used for) provided by financing activities was $1,013,160 compared to $261,020, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used by financing activity primarily resulted from an increase in proceeds from notes payable during the year ended December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a cash balance and current asset total of $59,261 and $527,665 respectively, compared with $134,855 and $154,551 of cash and current assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The increase in assets was due to the related party deposit of $450,000 for brewery equipment.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total current liabilities of $4,364,451 compared with $9,588,260 as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in current liabilities was primarily attributed to a decrease in derivative liabilities and accounts payable.
Going Concern
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. Since its inception, the Company has been funded by related parties through capital investment and borrowing funds.
As of December 31, 2021, we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our December 31, 2021 audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
Future Financings
We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Significant Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty liabilities, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the significant accounting policies and assumptions as detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements contained herein may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.
Contractual Obligations
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
