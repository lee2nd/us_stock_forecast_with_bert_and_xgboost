We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report.
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operations.
We expect we will require additional capital to develop our business plan. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
Results of Operations
Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021
the Company had $0 operating revenues during fiscal year 2022 as the Company ceased operations of its PPE business since July 2021. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we had operating revenues of $2,556,942. Cost of sales was $2,576,875 resulting in gross loss of $19,933, or (0.8%). These revenues are from the sale of PPE products.
Total operating expenses in the year ended June 30, 2022 were $1,230,468 compared to $2,583,100 for the same period in 2021. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of company downsizing. The Company’s net loss was $1,288,802 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $5,203,820 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The net loss for the fiscal year 2022 is primarily a result of operating expenses, and interest expense.
During our fiscal year 2021, total operating expenses were $2,583,100 compared to $2,217,981 for the same period in 2020. The increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of increased write down of inventory. The Company’s net loss was $5,203,820 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $2,600,468 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The net loss for the fiscal 2021 is primarily a result of operating expenses, financing expense, loss on settlement of debt and, loss on investment in HIE.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash balance at June 30, 2022 was $325 compared to $282,131 at June 30, 2021. We do not believe these cash reserves are sufficient to cover our expenses for our operations for fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. We will require additional funding for our ongoing operations.
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company issued common stock valued at $30,000 in connection with a settlement of accounts payable. In addition, the Company issued common stock valued $477,000 associated with stock payables settlements by related parties.
As of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we raised approximately $20,000 from private offerings of our common stock and an additional $67,500 from exercise of warrants. We raised additional funds of $500,000, net from a related party, which is included in inventory financing payable and $250,000 from convertible notes related party.
In addition, we intend to raise funds through the sale of equity and the exercise of warrants issued in private placements. Although to date we have had some warrant exercises for cash, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise money through offerings or through the exercise of warrants. If we cannot raise any additional financing prior to the expiration of the first quarter of 2023, we believe we will be able to obtain loans from management in the future, if necessary, but have no agreement in writing.
We are a smaller reporting company and have accumulated losses to date. Under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence, we believe we will require additional funds over the next 12 months to complete our regulatory reporting and filings. However, we will require maximum participation through private placements, warrant exercises or alternative financings to implement our business plan.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.
Plan of Operation and Funding
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through equity offerings, warrant exercises, and related party advances in the near future. We have no guarantees or firm commitments that the related party advances will continue in the near future.
Existing working capital, further advances, together with anticipated capital raises are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising enough capital, or that we will receive the cash flow required to fund our operations. We have no lines of credit with banking institutions or other bank financing arrangements, we do have a line a credit form a related party (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements). Generally, we have financed operations to date through proceeds from the sale of our common stock, warrant exercises and convertible loans.
Management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses relating to: (i) developmental expenses; and (ii) legal and accounting fees, required to complete our filings with the SEC. We intend to finance these expenses with issuances of securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants.
Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue our operations.
Material Commitments
As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any material commitments.
Purchase of Significant Equipment
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Going Concern
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $10,882,176 at June 30, 2022 and net loss from operations of $1,288,802.
The Company does not yet have a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of equity securities and related party advances. In addition, the Company is in the development stage and has accumulated losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue operations is dependent on the success of Management’s plans and raising of capital through the issuance of equity securities, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.
The Company will require additional funding to finance its operations as well as to identify, negotiate and materialize a business combination with a target business. The Company believes its current available cash may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
