Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $35,065. We are in the early stage of development and have experienced net losses to date and have not generated revenue from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to commercialize potential products and generate revenue, including identifying and establishing strategic partners and technologies for the successful development of product candidates, which includes clinical trials, FDA approval, demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate commercial orders by customers and licensing or acquiring intellectual property, as well as effective marketing and sales capabilities for our product. We do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish any of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue and expect to incur increasing operating expenses. We will require substantial additional funds for operations, the service of debt and to fund our business objectives. There can be no assurance that financing, whether debt or equity, will always be available to us in the amount required at any particular time or for any particular period or, if available, that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities, such as through the issuance and exercise of warrants, then existing stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt or other equity instruments, we may be subject to certain limitations in our operations, and issuance of such securities may have rights senior to those of the then existing stockholders. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person or entity to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.
As we monitor the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, we continue exploring sources of debt and equity financings as well as available grants. We are currently exploring and are in discussions for potential strategic alternatives in the biotechnology field which could advance our MSCs and neurodegenerative research. There can be no assurance the necessary financing will be available or that a suitable strategic partner will be identified. In such event, we may explore relationships with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we have not previously sought to develop or commercialize, decide to exit our existing business, cease operations altogether or pursue an acquisition of our company. However, without additional financing, we do not believe our resources will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs beyond the second quarter of 2022.
Quick Capital Financing
On June 15, 2021, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Quick Capital, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“Quick Capital”), pursuant to which the Company issued Quick Capital a twelve-month convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $115,000 (the “Note”) for a $100,000 investment, which included an original issuance discount of 10% and a $3,500 credit for Quick Capital’s legal and transaction costs. In connection with the Note issuance, Quick Capital was also issued a five-year warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 115,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (the “Warrant Shares”). If there is no effective registration statement covering the Warrant Shares, Quick Capital may exercise the Warrant on a cashless basis. The Note is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The Note may not be converted, and the Warrant may not be exercised if after giving effect to such conversion or exercise, as the case may be, Quick Capital and its affiliates would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. For twelve months following the issuance of the Quick Note, Quick Capital will have the right of first refusal to participate in future financings proposed to the Company on the same terms and participation rights to purchase up to $115,000 of securities in other offerings. The conversion price of the Note will be reduced if the Company issues common stock or grants derivative securities for consideration at a price less than the conversion price to the amount of the consideration of such dilutive issuance. The Note contains certain restrictive covenants limiting the Company’s ability to make distributions or dividends, repurchase its securities, incur debt, sell assets, make loans, or engage in exchange offers. If an event of default (as described in the Note) occurs, the Note will become immediately due and payable in an amount equal to 150% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Note plus any interest or amounts owing to Quick Capital. Quick Capital is entitled to the same terms of future financings of the Company that are more favorable than the terms of the Quick Note.
Offering
The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on January 11, 2022, to offer and sell up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock in a self-underwritten primary offering at a fixed price of $0.70 per share which was declared effective on January 11, 2022. To date, no shares have been sold and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in selling any of the shares being offered.
Covid-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the research and development of our product candidates. Research facilities at Dartmouth were subject to closures as well as laboratories at Ariel in Israel. This resulted in our discontinuing our research at these Universities and was part of our decision to adjust our research to be collaborative and to seek aligning with third parties to advance our expanded goals. We do not currently know the full extent of potential delays of research in the future as a result of the continuing pandemic and the ultimate impact on us and our research relationships is currently uncertain.
COVID-19 has also caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which impacts our ability to raise additional capital and continues to impact the Company’s workforce and its collaborative development efforts.
Going Concern
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, does not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 includes an explanatory paragraph stating the Company has recurring losses and limited operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital. the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements.
Research and Development Costs: The Company charges research and development costs to expense when incurred in accordance with ASC 730, “Research and Development”.

Warrants: The Company accounts for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815 ”Derivatives and Hedging”, as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), (including its EITF, the AICPA and the SEC), did not or are not believed by management to have a material effect on the Company’s present or future financial statements.
