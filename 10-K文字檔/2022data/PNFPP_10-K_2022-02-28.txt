Overview
General. Our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6.75 compared to fully diluted net income per common share of $4.03 and $5.22 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, loans had increased by $989.8 million as compared to December 31, 2020.
Impact of COVID-19. COVID-19 and related health and safety measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals continue to cause uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the economy, including the economies of the markets that we serve. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we began to treat COVID-19 as endemic and as such adjusted our protocols to align with that decision. The goal in this decision is to prioritize our culture while responding to risks in real-time. As with any endemic situation, we believe there will be times where extra precaution is necessary, including following quarantine guidance and masking, and we intend to implement that precaution as needed. Additionally, we continue to strongly encourage and incentivize vaccination among our associates, with vaccination or a recent negative test a prerequisite for attending company gatherings. We believe our response to COVID-19 allowed and continues to allow us to appropriately support our associates, clients and their communities.
For more information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - COVID-19 Risks” and throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Results of operations. Our net interest income increased to $932.4 million for 2021 compared to $821.8 million for 2020 and $766.1 million for 2019. The increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 was largely the result of lower cost of funds and organic loan growth.The increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 was largely the result of lower cost of funds, the impact of both interest and fees related to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, our building of additional liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and organic loan growth.
Net interest income in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was affected by fluctuations in our net interest spread and for 2021 and 2020 was materially impacted by income on PPP loans. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for 2021 was 3.02% compared to 2.97% and 3.46% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our provision for credit losses was $16.1 million for 2021 compared to $203.8 million in 2020 and $27.3 million in 2019. The decrease in provision expense is primarily due to improvements in current and projected economic conditions as compared to the economic deterioration that occurred or was anticipated during 2020 as a result of COVID-19, resulting in the recapture of previously recorded reserves. Also contributing to provision expense in all periods were net charge-offs which were $38.7 million during 2021 compared to $39.4 million in 2020 and $16.1 million in 2019. The increase in net charge-offs in 2021 and 2020 was in part the result of charge-offs related to credits to borrowers whose businesses are in sectors which have been more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
At December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.12% compared to 1.27% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of improvements in the macroeconomic forecasts utilized within our CECL models to estimate future credit losses.
Noninterest income for 2021 compared to 2020 increased by $77.9 million, or 24.5%. The growth in noninterest income for 2021 compared to 2020 was in large part attributable to an increase in income from our equity method investment in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG) of $38.7 million, or 46.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, positively impacting noninterest income were wealth management revenues of $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $56.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Other noninterest income, which is the result of, among other things, fee revenue lines of business other than those noted above, also increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 by $46.9 million when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase of $22.0 million in income from other equity investments and an increase of $16.3 million from interchange and other consumer fees when compared to 2020. The above increases were offset by a decrease in gains on mortgage loans sold, net, which decreased by $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the fluctuations in the interest rate environment and a decline in inventory of homes available-for-sale in our markets in 2021.
Noninterest income for 2020 compared to 2019 increased by $54.0 million, or 20.5%. The growth in noninterest income for 2020 compared to 2019 was in large part attributable to gains on mortgage loans sold, net, which increased by $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the favorable interest rate environment and housing markets in our markets in 2020 as well as our increased number of mortgage originators in the respective periods. These gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were offset in part by a decrease in income from our equity method investment in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG) of $6.6 million, or 7.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, positively impacting noninterest income was income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) of $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $47.7 million for the same period in the prior year as well as $986,000 in net gains on sales of securities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.9 million in net losses on sales of securities during 2019. Other noninterest income, which is the result of, among other things, fee revenue lines of business other than those noted above, increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 by $12.1 million when compared to the same period in the prior year.
Noninterest expense for 2021 compared to 2020 increased by $95.6 million, or 16.9%. Impacting noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020 was the $101.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. The change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our annual cash incentive plan accrual and an increase in equity compensation expense both due to accruals associated with achievement of above-target level performance during 2021 compared to 2020 when our performance resulted in below-target level achievement for cash and forfeiture of a portion of the equity awards we had issued with performance measures tied to 2020 performance equity incentives, as well as annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2021 and an increase in our associate base in 2021 versus 2020.Impacting the decrease in other noninterest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 were $15.2 million in FHLB restructuring charges and $4.7 million in hedge termination charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 and did not reoccur in 2021.
Noninterest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 increased by $59.3 million, or 11.7%. Impacting noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was the $21.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. The change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in our associate base in 2020 versus 2019 offset, in part, by the reduction of our annual cash incentive plan accrual due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the adoption of CECL on diluted EPS, one of the performance metrics in our annual cash incentive plan, during 2020. We also incurred reduced incentive expense associated with our performance-based equity awards we had previously awarded, as the negative impact of COVID-19 and the adoption of CECL on our results negatively impacted our return on average tangible assets, the performance metric then applicable to these equity awards. Also impacting noninterest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $15.2 million in FHLB restructuring charges and $4.7 million in hedge termination charges that occurred as a part of the strategic initiatives of the Company.
The number of full-time equivalent employees increased from 2,487.0 at December 31, 2019, to 2,634.0 at December 31, 2020 and 2,841.0 at December 31, 2021.
During the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $124.6 million, $59.0 million and $96.7 million, respectively. Our tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was impacted by the adoption of CECL and the provision for credit losses recorded in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was 19.1%, 15.9%, and 19.4%, respectively.
Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 49.7%, 49.5%, and 49.0%, for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and in 2020 as compared to 2019 were both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to noninterest expense, net interest income and noninterest income discussed above.
Net income for 2021 was $527.3 million compared to $312.3 million in 2020 and $400.9 million in 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for 2021 was $512.1 million compared to $304.7 million in 2020 and $400.9 million in 2019. The presentation of net income available to common shareholders (rather than net income available to shareholders) was required following the issuance of 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our 6.75% fixed rate non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) in the second quarter of 2020. Fully-diluted net income per common share was $6.75 for 2021 compared to $4.03 for 2020 and $5.22 for 2019. Net income in 2021 was primarily impacted positively by decreased provision expense incurred and lower cost of funds during 2021. Fully-diluted net income per common share in 2021 and 2020 was also impacted by the dividends paid on the Series B Preferred Stock. Additionally, positively impacting fully-diluted net income per common share in each of the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019 were organic growth and for 2020 and 2019 the share repurchase programs effective during such periods.
Financial Condition. Our loan balances increased by $989.8 million, or 4.4%, during 2021 as compared to 2020. Increased loan volumes during 2021 are primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company offset by a decrease of $1.4 billion of loans issued through the SBA's PPP.
Total deposits increased from $27.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $31.3 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.6 billion, or 13.0%. Deposit growth during the period was likely aided by our clients' desire to maintain elevated levels of on-balance sheet liquidity in comparison to those historically maintained prior to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy as well as government stiumulus programs initiated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our own increased levels of on-balance sheet liquidity acquired at the beginning of the pandemic and for which we have not yet repurposed. Within our deposits, the ratio of core funding to total deposits increased from 79.5% at December 31, 2020 to 89.5% at December 31, 2021.
We believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve. As such, we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing small-and middle-market clients particularly if the economies in our principal markets continue to expand.
Capital and Liquidity. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. From time to time, we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $184.2 million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank.
During the second quarter of 2020, net proceeds from the offering of our 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us were approximately $217.1 million. The net proceeds were initially retained at Pinnacle Financial and the remaining net proceeds are available to support our capital needs and other obligations, including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, to support the capital needs and other obligations of our bank and for other general corporate purposes. Additionally, we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a new revolving credit facility with another financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels.
On November 13, 2018, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock and on October 15, 2019, the board approved an additional $100.0 million of repurchase authorization. The initial repurchase program expired on March 31, 2020 and the additional $100.0 million authorization expired on December 31, 2020, though it had been suspended since the end of the first quarter of 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Between November 13, 2018 and December 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $82.1 million pursuant to these authorizations. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.8 million. Our last purchase of shares of our common stock occurred on March 19, 2020. On January 19, 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program will remain in effect through March 31, 2022. On January 18, 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock to commence upon expiration of our existing share repurchase program that is set to expire on March 31, 2022. This authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2023.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for credit losses and the assessment of impairment of goodwill, has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans - The allowance for credit losses is estimated under the CECL methodology set forth in FASB ASC 326. The allowance for credit losses reflects management’s estimate of the the amount of credit losses expected to be recognized over the remaining life of the loans in our portfolio. This evaluation requires significant management judgment and is based upon relevant available information related to historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, and other portfolio-specific and environmental risk factors. Losses are predicted over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses revert to long term historical averages. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. There are factors beyond our control, such as changes in projected economic conditions, real estate markets or particular industry conditions which may materially impact asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and thus the resulting provision for credit losses. The allowance is adjusted through provision for credit losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. See “Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans” elsewhere within this section as well as Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.
Impairment of Goodwill - Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described in ASC 350. Accordingly, we performed a qualitative assessment by examining changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors and other relevant entity-specific events, including changes in the share price of our common stock. While we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing are appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include significant fluctuations in our asset/liability balances or the composition of our balance sheet; a change in the overall valuation of the stock market, specifically bank stocks; performance of Southeast U.S. Banks; and our performance relative to peers. Changes in these assumptions, or any other key assumptions, could have a material impact on our qualitative assessment, resulting in the decision to perform additional procedures to identify and determine the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Should it be determined in a future period that goodwill has become impaired, then a charge to earnings would be recorded in the period such determination is made. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to goodwill.
Results of Operations
The following is a summary of certain financial information as of or for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
(1) Return on average assets is the result of net income available to common shareholders for the reported period, divided by average assets for the period.
(2) Return on average shareholders' equity is the result of net income available to common shareholders for the reported period, divided by average shareholders' equity for the period.
(3) Return on average common shareholders' equity is the result of net income available to common shareholders for the reported period, divided by average common shareholders' equity for the period.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded net interest income of approximately $932.4 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.02%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net interest income of approximately $821.8 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 2.97%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net interest income of approximately $766.1 million, which resulted in a net interest margin of 3.46%. The increase in net interest income in 2021 as compared to 2020 was largely the result of lower cost of funds as short-term interest rates remain low and organic loan growth. The increase in net interest income in 2020 as compared to 2019 were largely the result of lower funding costs due to a decline in short-term interest rates, the impact of both interest and fees from the PPP and our acquisition of additional on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable period offset in part by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio.
The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions, through changes to the federal funds rate. Our loan portfolio is affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2019 at 5.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. During 2020, the prime rate decreased 150 basis points in March to 3.25% where it remained through December 31, 2021. Our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). At December 31, 2021, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 0.10% and 0.21%, respectively, while at December 31, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 0.14% and 0.24% respectively, and at December 31, 2019, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 1.76% and 1.90% respectively. We intend to discontinue originating LIBOR-based loans during 2022 and have begun negotiating loans primarily using our preferred replacement index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). For our currently outstanding LIBOR-based loans, the timing and manner in which each customer’s contract transitions to SOFR will vary on a case-by-case basis. We expect to complete all loan transitions by June 30, 2023.
The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for total interest-earning assets and total interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
(1)Average balances of nonperforming loans, consumer loans held-for-sale and commercial loans held-for-sale are included in average loan balances.
(2)Yields computed on tax-exempt instruments on a tax equivalent basis and include $33.8 million, $29.9 million and $29.0 million of taxable equivalent income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the then current period presented.
(3)Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have been 3.01% compared to a net interest spread for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of 2.94% and 3.41%, respectively.
(4)Net interest margin is the result of net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets for the period.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net interest spread was 2.87%, while the net interest margin was 3.02% compared to a net interest spread of 2.72% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 3.06% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a net interest margin of 2.97% and 3.46%, respectively.
Our net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 continued to reflect the impact of PPP loans and the firm's acquisition of additional on-balance sheet liquidity in the early stages of the pandemic and subsequent paydown of this liquidity, the continuation of the historically low short-term interest rate environment, declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. More specifically, our net interest margin was negatively impacted by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio due to a historically low macroeconomic interest rate environment, which included a 150 basis points reduction in the federal funds rate in March 2020 and has remained at this historically low level.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our earning asset yield decreased by 34 basis points and 145 basis points from the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while total funding rates decreased by 40 basis points and 104 basis points compared to the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. Pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets. We believe this challenging competitive environment will continue throughout 2022. The additional on-balance sheet liquidity that has accumulated primarily due to government stimulus efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to negatively impact the net interest margin until on-balance sheet liquidity returns to more normalized levels.
Our ‘most likely’ forecast has short-term interest rates moving higher during 2022 and 2023. In this scenario, our loan yields on variable rate instruments will increase but at a somewhat slower pace than market rates due to our in-the-money rate floors. Once the contract rate eclipses the rate floor strike level, the loan yields will increase more quickly following subsequent rate hikes. Floor strike levels are, on average, 45 basis points above contract rates. Therefore, our ability to hold deposit rates low until the loan floor strike levels are eclipsed by contract rates will be important in our ability to maintain, or potentially increase, our net interest margin during the beginning of the monetary tightening cycle that we believe we will experience starting in 2022.
Rate and Volume Analysis. Net interest income increased by $110.6 million between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and by $55.6 million between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following is an analysis of the changes in our net interest income comparing the changes attributable to rates and those attributable to volumes (in thousands):
Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume.
Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses.The provision for credit losses amounted to $16.1 million, $203.8 million and $27.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Provision expense is impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, our expectations about future economic conditions and net charge-offs. The lower provision for credit losses during 2021 as compared to 2020 is the result of improvements in the current and projected economic conditions as compared to the economic deterioration which occurred or was anticipated during 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the provision expense in the current year when compared to the 2020 and 2019 comparable periods were net charge-offs, which totaled $38.7 million, $39.4 million and $16.1 million, respectively. Net charge-offs in 2021 and 2020 were in part the result of charge-offs related to loans to borrowers who operate businesses in sectors which have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Provision expense in 2019 was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology. Furthermore, provision expense related to off-balance sheet credit exposures was reported as a component of other noninterest expense prior to 2020.
Our allowance for credit losses reflects an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover all expected future losses as of the date the allowance is determined based on our allowance for credit losses assessment methodology. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP loans, was 1.12%, down from 1.27% at December 31, 2020.
Noninterest Income. Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period.
The following is our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):
The increase in service charges on deposit accounts in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily related to increased analysis fees due to an increase in the volume and number of commercial checking accounts resulting from organic growth in this product and an increase in economic activity as the COVID-19 pandemic waned over 2021. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily related to a reduction in analysis fees due to a decrease in the transaction volume of commercial checking accounts which we believe was the result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, and fees from our wealth advisory group, PNFP Capital Markets, Inc., were $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $29.5 million during 2020 and $24.2 million during 2019, reflecting increases in brokerage assets and year-over-year increases in the value of the stock market. At December 31, 2021, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $7.2 billion in brokerage assets compared to $5.5 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance agency subsidiaries were approximately $10.5 million during 2021 compared to $10.1 million and $9.3 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $4.7 billion and $2.1 billion of managed and custodied assets, respectively, compared to approximately $3.3 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $2.9 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. We believe the improvement in the results of our wealth management businesses in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to increased market valuations reflective of a stabilizing economy following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the improvement in 2020 compared to 2019 was largely attributable to increased market valuations as well as additional revenue producers added to our wealth management groups in 2020.
Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $32.4 million, $60.0 million and $24.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 is the direct result of the fluctuations in the rate environment and the decrease in housing inventory in the markets where we operate negatively impacting originations. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 is the direct result of the then favorable interest rate environment which impacted volumes specifically with refinancing activity during the respective periods, an increase in the number of revenue producers in our mortgage group and the strong housing markets in which we operate. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. The change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At December 31, 2021, the mortgage pipeline included $136.7 million in loans expected to close in 2022 compared to $249.8 million in loans at December 31, 2020 expected to close in 2021.
Investment gains and losses on sales, net, represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the periods noted. For the year ended December 31, 2021, investment gains (losses) on sales, net, represent a $759,000 net pre-tax gain we recognized upon the sale of $37.5 million of investment securities compared to a $986,000 net pre-tax gain we recognized upon the sale of $145.6 million of investment securities in 2021 compared to a $5.9 million net pre-tax loss on the sale of $737.7 million of investment securities in 2019.
Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold without recourse to independent financial institutions and investors.
Income from this equity-method investment was $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $83.5 million and $90.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increased level of contribution we experienced from BHG in 2021 when compared to 2020 reflects the positive results BHG has experienced as a result of enhancements to its business model, including its marketing efforts, along with a diminished impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting release of reserves BHG built in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 is the result of BHG recording increased allowance for loan losses for loans retained and recourse obligation reserves for loans sold through its network of bank purchasers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. In the second half of 2019, BHG began an effort to retain more loans on its balance sheet. However, as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, BHG sold more loans through its auction platform in 2020 than we had previously anticipated. During 2021, BHG returned to its strategy of retaining more of the loans it originates on its balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 and third quarter of 2021, BHG completed a total of three securitization issuances of approximately $160 million, $375 million and $372 million, respectively, in notes backed by commercial and consumer loans on its balance sheet to provide additional funding. We anticipate that BHG will complete additional securitizations in the future.
Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of $752,000, $1.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there were $6.8 million of these intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 14 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment, is accretion income associated with the fair value of certain of BHG's liabilities of $1.5 million, $2.1 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there were $1.2 million of these liabilities that are expected to be accreted into income in lesser amounts over the next five years.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank received $70.0 million, $53.0 million and $51.3 million in dividends in the aggregate from BHG. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Pinnacle Bank purchased $276.7 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of loans from BHG at par pursuant to BHG's joint venture loan program whereby BHG and Pinnacle Bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase. The yield on this portfolio to Pinnacle Bank is anticipated to be between 4.75% and 5.00% per annum. Pinnacle Bank purchased no loans from BHG during the year ended December 31, 2019.
As our ownership interest in BHG is 49% and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on BHG's board of managers, we do not consolidate BHG's results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of BHG's activities at our percentage ownership in income from equity-method investment in noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, BHG reported $735.5 million in gross revenues, net of substitution losses of $91.8 million, compared to $457.9 million and $366.5 million in gross revenues, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net of substitution losses of $90.6 million and $53.1 million, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. Approximately $507.5 million, or 69.0%, of BHG's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to gains on the sale of commercial loans BHG had previously issued primarily to doctor, dentist and other professionals compared to $347.4 million, or 75.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $291.1 million, or 79.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. These loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan. The purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, of these loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by BHG's network of bank purchasers. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $207.3 million and $280.2 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution. This liability represents 5.0% and 7.6%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in this liability for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was principally the result of a partial release of the reserve BHG recorded in 2020 related to the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic which adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner.
In addition to these loans that BHG sells into its auction market, at December 31, 2021, BHG reported balance sheet loans totaling $2.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, BHG had $1.6 billion and $631.0 million, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting. BHG currently expects to continue to increase the percentage of loans that it keeps on its balance sheet. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, BHG reported allowance for loan losses totaling $46.7 million and $20.7 million, respectively, with respect to the loans on its balance sheet. Interest income and fees on loans held for investment amounted to $208.5 million, $92.5 million and $60.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. BHG continues to account for its allowance for loan losses using the incurred loss model that we utilized prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. BHG is expected to adopt CECL on January 1, 2023.
Pinnacle Bank has a participating interest in a $525.0 million revolving line of credit for the benefit of BHG in the amount of $100.0 million. At December 31, 2021, there was a $47.2 million outstanding balance on the line related to Pinnacle Bank's interest in the line. The line accrues interest at SOFR plus 200 basis points and is secured by all assets of BHG. The credit agreement contains covenants requiring BHG to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain other affirmative and negative covenants. At December 31, 2021, neither BHG nor the originating bank had represented to Pinnacle Bank that BHG was not in compliance, in all material respects, with these covenants.
Included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased 39.8% during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due to increased debit and credit card transactions period-over-period and unused line fees during 2021 as compared to 2020. Other noninterest income also included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) which was $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.8 million and $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We made no purchases of BOLI policies in 2021. In 2020 and 2019, we purchased $75.0 million and $110.0 million, respectively, of new BOLI policies. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. Loan swap fees increased by $846,000 and $656,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively, due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environment. SBA loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment and therefore increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to historically high premiums on this product. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investment. Income related to these investments increased $22.0 million during 2021 when compared to 2020 as a result of several of our venture fund investments experiencing increased valuations in their underlying portfolios during the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2020 as compared to 2019, these investments decreased by $1.7 million. The other components of other noninterest income changed only slightly during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 and includes all other noninterest income not included in the above noted categories. The other components of other noninterest income fluctuated during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 due in large part to $3.9 million in policy benefits received during 2020 from our bank-owned life insurance policies as well as the $1.5 million loss on the sale of the high-yield automobile portfolio in the second quarter of 2019.
Noninterest Expense. The following is our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):
The increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in 2021 over 2020 is primarily the result of an increase in expenses associated with our annual cash incentive plan as well as stock-based compensation expense due to our performance during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense in 2020 over 2019 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2020 over 2019 and annual merit increases to base salaries offset in part by the reduction in expenses associated with our annual cash incentive plan as well as the reduction in stock-based compensation expense due to our performance during 2020 compared to 2019. Our performance in 2020 was notably impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on our anticipated earnings and performance for the year ended December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021, our associate base had expanded to 2,841.0 full-time equivalent associates as compared to 2,634.0 and 2,487.0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily resulting from our efforts to continue to hire experienced bankers and other associates throughout our footprint. We expect salary and benefit expenses will rise in 2022 compared to 2021 as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in our markets, including the Atlanta, Huntsville, Birmingham and National Capital markets, as well as due to our increased associate base and annual merit increases given in the first quarter of each fiscal year. We also expect to continue to enhance the infrastructure around our operations to account for our increased size and geographic reach in 2022, which should also contribute to increased salary and benefit expenses.
Commissions expense represents compensation paid to our wealth management lines of business including investment services, trust, insurance and capital markets. Commissions expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 42.2% greater than in 2020 which was 13.6% greater than in 2019. The increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 and in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily related to growth in our investment portfolio commissions as a result of increased activity in our wealth management lines of business and an increase in the number of wealth management associates. Commissions expense incurred related to the production of residential mortgages is recorded net of the related mortgage revenues.
We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the 2021 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments required achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of quarterly pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) and annual earnings per common share (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and PPNR and earnings per common share are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. For 2021, maximum payouts under the plan could reach 160% of target as we sought to allow our associates to recoup a portion of the 2020 annual cash incentive plan award that had not been earned largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our allowance for credit losses as a result of our adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020. In 2021, our cash incentives represented 160% of targeted incentive compensation compared to 65% in 2020 and 120% in 2019. We intend to return to normalized targeted cash incentive levels of 0% to 125% in 2022.
Cash incentives for 2021 totaled $84.1 million, compared to $33.9 million in 2020 and $46.8 million in 2019. The increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 was primarily the result of the increase in the percentage of target of the payout from 65% in 2020 to 160% in 2021. The decrease in 2020 when compared to 2019 is the result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our anticipated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result of our performance in 2020 the threshold for the plan's EPS target was not met, which resulted in a reduction in incentives earned under the annual cash incentive plan. In the third quarter of 2020, due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our board of directors approved an additional performance metric under the annual cash incentive plan tied to our adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue for the year ending December 31, 2020 (“PPNR”). Payouts for all participants based on the PPNR metric were between 15% and 25% of their targeted payouts under the plan at target and maximum performance levels. As a result of the addition of the PPNR performance metric, participants in the plan were able to earn a cash incentive payout under the plan based on the larger of the original plan metrics and the new PPNR performance metric and the original deposit volume and rate goals under the plan. The PPNR metric and the original deposit volume and rate goals were achieved at the maximum performance, resulting in payouts of 50% of the targeted payout; however, due to our results for 2020 and in consideration of the considerable effort our associates put forth during unusually difficult circumstances in 2020, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee approved an increase in the calculated award from 50 percent of target to 65 percent of target, which amounted to $6.8 million of additional expense in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Also included in cash and equity incentives for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $12.1 million, $12.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share awards and approximately $12.9 million, $6.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share units with either time-based or performance-based vesting criteria. We have not issued stock options since 2008. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization.
Our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased when compared to the same period in 2020 primarily as a result of the fact that our performance in 2021 in regards to the return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share accretion performance metrics relative to our peers provided for an above-target level payout. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased when compared to the same period in 2019 primarily as a result of the fact that our performance in 2020 was below the threshold level of return on average tangible assets necessary for the recipients of those awards to earn that the portion of our performance-based awards with performance periods linked to 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Though our return on average tangible assets for 2020 was below that level necessary for any of the performance units granted with performance metrics tied to 2020 to be earned, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our board of directors nonetheless approved the vesting of the target level of these awards for all of the recipients of these awards other than our named executive officers, who forfeited their awards tied to the 2020 performance period. In January 2021, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our board of directors approved modifications to the performance metrics applicable to the 2021 and 2022 performance periods of our performance units previously awarded. These modifications replaced the return on average tangible assets performance metrics with two equally weighted metrics - return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share accretion including the impact of common dividends. Performance awards granted in January 2021 also utilize these modified metrics, as well as a relative total shareholder return ("TSR") payout modifier. In 2022, we again granted performance-based vesting equity awards with performance metrics tied to peer relative performance for return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share accretion, together with a TSR modifier, in each case over a three-year performance period. We also approved a special performance-based vesting restricted stock unit award to each of our named executive officers and our chief credit officer in 2022 with performance metrics tied to the ratio of our price to earnings and price to tangible book value per share relative to those measures for a peer group of companies. As a result, we expect that our compensation expense associated with performance-based equity awards for 2022 will likely exceed those levels that we recorded in 2021. Our compensation expense associated with equity awards with time-based vesting criteria has remained relatively flat between 2021 when compared to 2020 and increased in 2020 compared to 2019. The change in this balance is a product of the hiring and termination of the associates during the period and the number of equity grants given to associates during the respective periods as well as the grant date fair value of these equity grants.
Employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, payroll taxes and contract labor. These expenses increased by $12.3 million, or 24.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020 which increased by $4.7 million, or 10.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of the increase in full-time equivalent associates in each respective period.
Our operating lease commitments are primarily related to our branch and headquarters facilities. The terms of these leases expire at various points ranging from 2022 through 2058. At December 31, 2021, our total minimum operating lease commitment was $114.1 million. Equipment and occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 7.7% greater than in 2020 which was 4.6% greater than in 2019. The increases are in part the result of the four new office locations that were opened, one in Georgia, one in Alabama, one in the North Carolina market and the other in the Middle Tennessee market during the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance both our current locations and our technology infrastructure. We believe that we can fund these costs primarily through operating income. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2021, we announced our intention to move our corporate headquarters to a newly announced office tower in Nashville, where we will be a founding partner and sponsor of the project. This move is currently planned for 2025 and will impact equipment and occupancy costs as we plan for this move.
Other real estate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a benefit of $712,000 compared to expense of $8.6 million in 2020 and $4.2 million in 2019. The decrease in 2021 as compared to 2020 and increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 was the result of write-downs in 2020 of $8.4 million of previously foreclosed upon properties to market value based on updated appraisals.
Marketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 20.5% greater than in 2020 which was 19.3% less than in 2019. The primary source of the increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 and decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 is related to the decrease of in-person business meetings and client meals and entertainment during 2020 as a result of the restrictions resulting from COVID-19 and the lessening of these restrictions and subsequent uptick of in-person business meeting and client meals and entertainment during 2021.
Noninterest expense related to the amortization of intangibles was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $9.8 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuations and their intangible lives as of December 31, 2021:
These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Amortization expense related to these assets is estimated to decrease from $7.0 million per year to $4.4 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period.
Total other noninterest expenses decreased by $4.7 million to $100.0 million during 2021 when compared to 2020 and increased by $33.0 million to $104.6 million during 2020 when compared to 2019. Included in other noninterest expenses are deposit and lending related expenses, investment and trust sales expenses, audit, exam and insurance expense and administrative expenses.
Deposit related expenses were relatively flat in 2021 and decreased by only $389,000 when compared to 2020. These same expenses increased by $7.4 million in 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase in 2020 when compared to 2019 was largely the result of increased FDIC assessment costs primarily due to the firm's increased asset base. Lending related expenses increased by $10.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in 2021 when compared to 2020 and 2020 when compared to 2019. Audit, exam and insurance expense is comprised of the fees associated with ongoing audit and regulatory exams of our operations as well as the cost of our corporate insurance. Increases in audit, exam and insurance expense in 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2019 is primarily related to increased regulation of our operations as a result of our increased asset size in each of the respective periods. Also included in other noninterest expense were $15.2 million in restructuring charges associated with our prepayment of $1.1 billion in FHLB advances during 2020. No FHLB restructuring charges were incurred in either 2021 or 2019. Administrative and other expenses remained relatively flat decreasing by $556,000 during 2021 when compared to 2020 and increasing by $4.8 million during 2020 when compared to 2019. Included in the $4.8 million increase in 2020 was $4.7 million of unrealized losses reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) into net income related to cash flow swaps with a notional amount of $99.0 million which were terminated on December 16, 2020.
Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 49.7%, 49.5%, and 49.0% for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Increases in cash incentives in 2021 negatively impacted our efficiency ratio in 2021, while other real estate expense and net gains and losses on sales of securities impacted our efficiency ratios in each of 2020 and 2019. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was negatively impacted by the $15.2 million in FHLB restructuring charges and $4.7 million in hedge termination charges noted above. Net income for 2021 was $527.3 million compared to $312.3 million in net income in 2020 and $400.9 million in 2019. Fully-diluted net income per common share was $6.75 for 2021 compared to $4.03 for 2020 and $5.22 for 2019.
Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $124.6 million compared to $59.0 million and $96.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 19.1%, 15.9% and 19.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 26.14% primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified tax-exempt municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust and municipal investment subsidiaries, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and tax savings from our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax rate in each period was impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program, resulting in a tax benefit of $2.5 million, $417,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Financial Condition
Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 reflects an increase of $989.8 million in outstanding loans to $23.4 billion and an increase of $3.6 billion in total deposits to $31.3 billion from December 31, 2020. Total assets were $38.5 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to $34.9 billion at December 31, 2020.
Loans. The composition of loans at December 31 for each of the past three years and the percentage (%) of each segment to total loans are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
At December 31, 2021, our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, approximately 36.9% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties, compared to 35.0% at December 31, 2020. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development in the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land.
The following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by loan segment at December 31, 2021 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one but within five years, (3) after five but within fifteen years and (4) after fifteen years. The table also presents the portion of loans by loan segment that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index (dollars in thousands):
The above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments.
Loan Origination Risk Management. We maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loans in our portfolio, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.
Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals. Collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Some loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis.
Commercial real estate-mortgage loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property (in the case of income producing property), or the borrower's business (if owner-occupied) to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors, if any. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. As detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below, the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly. We believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve.
Construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and expectations of the permanent mortgage market, among other items. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project, which may be inaccurate. Construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property, refinancing in the permanent mortgage market, or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.
We also originate consumer loans, including consumer real-estate loans, where we typically use a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, seeks to minimize risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements.
We also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the risk committee of our board of directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures.
Lending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction and land development ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300%. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank’s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Pinnacle Bank’s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 79.1% and 89.0%, respectively. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans (including construction and development loans) were 234.1% and 264.0% for December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines throughout 2021 and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds though there may be periods where we exceed these levels if loan growth is more heavily weighted to these types of loans.
Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans amounted to approximately $109.6 million, or 0.5% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2021, compared to $173.5 million, or 0.8% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. None of the potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but less than 90 days as of December 31, 2021.
Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR). At December 31, 2021, we had $40.1 million in nonperforming assets compared to $86.2 million at December 31, 2020. Included in nonperforming assets were $31.6 million in nonaccruing loans, or 0.13% of total loans, and $8.5 million in other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2021 and $73.8 million in nonaccruing loans, or 0.33% of total loans, and $12.4 million in other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of TDRs that were performing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status. Nonaccruing loans totaled $61.6 million, or .31% of total loans, at December 31, 2019.
All nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan. The special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses. Typically, these special assets officers review our loan files, interview prior officers assigned to the relationship, meet with borrowers, inspect collateral, reappraise collateral and/or consult with legal counsel. The special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists, which could include foreclosing on collateral, restructuring the loan, issuing demand letters or other actions. We discontinue the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or (2) the principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. During 2021 and 2020, we recognized no interest income related to nonaccruing loans. In 2019, we recognized $176,000 of interest income from nonaccruing loans, reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief, at the time of payment, that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans. At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccruing loans totaled 833.8%, 386.1% and 153.8%, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (allowance). On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduced the current expected credit losses ("CECL") methodology and required us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our allowance for credit losses was $263.2 million and $285.1 million, respectively, which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, inclusive of PPP, was 1.12% at December 31, 2021, down from 1.27% at December 31, 2020. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded for PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA.
Our CECL models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, the commercial real estate price index and certain U.S. Treasury interest rates. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. These macroeconomic factors experienced significant deterioration during 2020, resulting in a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses during the same period. These factors reflected improvement during 2021 resulting in the decrease in the overall allowance for credit losses.
Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At December 31, 2021, a reasonable and supportable period of twenty-four months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages.
The following table sets forth, based on management's best estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans and loan balances by category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan category as of December 31 for each of the past two years (in thousands):
The following table presents information related to credit losses on loans by loan segment for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.
Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at December 31, 2021. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses.
Investments. Our investment portfolio, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities, amounted to $6.1 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our investment to asset ratio increased from 13.2% at December 31, 2020 to 15.8% at December 31, 2021. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, collateral for public funds and as a potential liquidity source. During 2021, we sold $37.5 million of investment securities for a net pre-tax gain of $759,000 compared to $145.6 million of investment securities for a net pre-tax gain of $986,000 during 2020 and $737.7 million of investment securities for a net pre-tax loss of $5.9 million during 2019. These sales were implemented as part of our efforts to reposition our investment portfolio to provide our balance sheet more protection from the then anticipated rate environment in each respective period.
During the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2018, we transferred, at fair value, $873.6 million and $179.8 million, respectively, of municipal securities from the available-for-sale portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio to mitigate the impact of changes in fair value on our common tangible book equity. The related net unrealized after tax gains of $69.0 million and losses of $2.2 million, respectively, on such transferred securities remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2021 and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount on the transferred securities. No gains or losses were recognized at the time of transfer. On January 1, 2022, we transferred, at fair value, $1.1 billion of securities from the available-for-sale portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio. The related net unrealized after tax losses of $1.5
million remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be amortized over the remaining lives of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or accretion of premium on the transferred securities. No gains or losses were recognized at the time of the transfer.
A summary of certain aspects of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows:
(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of December 31, 2021 was 5.21%.
The following table shows the carrying value of investment securities according to contractual maturity classifications of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year through five years, (3) after five years through ten years, and (4) after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities because the mortgages or other assets underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty. Therefore, these securities are not included in the maturity categories but are listed below these categories as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
Yields have been computed using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. Weighted average yield for each maturity range has been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the amortized cost of each security in that range.
Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $82.5 million and $223.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The decrease in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a decrease in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has increased. See Note 14. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Securities Purchased with Agreement to Resell. At December 31, 2021 we had $1.0 billion in securities purchased with agreement to resell. This balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with a financial institution counterparty. These investments deploy some of our liquidity position into an instrument that improves the return on those funds in the current low rate environment. Additionally, we believe it positions us more favorably for a potential rising interest rate environment in the future. All of these securities were purchased in 2021. Prior to 2021, no securities were purchased with agreement to resell.
Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $31.3 billion of deposits at December 31, 2021 compared to $27.7 billion billion at December 31, 2020. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we estimate that we had approximately $14.9 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. Additionally, we entered into agreements with certain customers to sell certain of our securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our commercial clients and provide the client with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $152.6 million at December 31, 2021 and $128.2 million at December 31, 2020. Average balances for these repurchase agreements were $155.9 million in 2021, $150.1 million in 2020 and $117.5 million in 2019. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, we had borrowed $888.7 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB Cincinnati) compared to $1.1 billion billion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, we had an estimated $3.1 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by us and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.
Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or non-core funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
(1)The reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network (the IntraFi network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the IntraFi network.
As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased from 79.5% at December 31, 2020 to 89.5% at December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the significant increase in deposits estimated to have been funded, in part, by PPP loans and other government stimulus payments, and our release of wholesale funding that was intentionally acquired to build on-balance sheet liquidity as we prepared for the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic but that we began releasing in the first quarter of 2021 and have continued releasing, where possible, through the end of 2021 based on our view of then current market conditions. On July 30, 2021, Pinnacle Bank redeemed $130.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due July 30, 2025. Additionally on November 16, 2021, Pinnacle Financial redeemed $120.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our subordinated notes due November 16, 2026. Competition for core deposits in our markets remains very competitive and we continue to anticipate that our percentage of non-core funding is likely to increase as PPP loan funds and stimulus monies are utilized.
When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2021.
The amount of time deposits as of December 31, 2021 amounted to $2.1 billion. The following table, which includes core, non-core and reciprocal time deposits, shows our time deposits at December 31, 2021 in denominations of under $250,000 and those of denominations of $250,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity of (1) three months or less, (2) over three but less than six months, (3) over six but less than twelve months and (4) over twelve months and the weighted average rate for each category (in thousands):
Subordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB Cincinnati, pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB Cincinnati, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Pinnacle Financial used a portion of its excess liquidity to prepay $1.1 billion in FHLB advances resulting in prepayment penalties of $15.2 million. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Pinnacle Financial had received advances from the FHLB Cincinnati totaling $888.7 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the scheduled maturities of FHLB Cincinnati advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands):
(1)Some FHLB Cincinnati advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future. The table reflects rates in effect as of December 31, 2021.
We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. These securities qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity. These instruments are outlined below (in thousands):
(1)Migrates to three month LIBOR + 2.775% (or an alternative benchmark rate plus a comparable spread in the event three month LIBOR is no longer published on such adjustment date) beginning September 15, 2024 through the end of the term.
On April 22, 2020, we established a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank in conjunction with the PPP. There are no amounts outstanding on this facility at December 31, 2021, and as of July 30, 2021, no new extensions of credit are allowed under the facility.
On July 30, 2021, Pinnacle Bank redeemed $130.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due July 30, 2025. Additionally, Pinnacle Financial redeemed $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes on November 16, 2021 due November 16, 2026. The redemptions were funded with existing cash on hand. Pursuant to regulatory guidelines, once the maturity date on subordinated notes is within five years, a portion of the notes will no longer be eligible to be included in regulatory capital, with an additional portion being excluded each year over the five year period approaching maturity.
Capital Resources. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our stockholders' equity amounted to $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. During the second quarter of 2020, we issued 9.0 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering costs were approximately $217.1 million. The net proceeds were initially retained by Pinnacle Financial and the remaining net proceeds are available to support our obligations including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and dividend payments on the Series B Preferred Stock, to support the capital needs of our company and our bank, and for other general corporate purposes. During 2020, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was negatively impacted by our intentional building of liquidity to support us through the COVID-19 pandemic and it has continued to be negatively impacted in 2021 by excess levels of liquidity on our balance sheet as customer deposit accounts have remained at elevated levels.
Our and our bank subsidiary's capital ratios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following table:
(*) Average assets for the above calculations were based on the most recent quarter.
We and our bank subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we and our bank subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our and Pinnacle Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
As permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, both we and our bank subsidiary have elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which was effective January 1, 2020. The initial impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13, as well as 25% of the quarterly increases in the allowance for credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 (collectively the “transition adjustments”), was delayed through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments of $68.0 million became fixed and will be phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three year period, with 75% recognized in 2022, 50% recognized in 2023, and 25% recognized in 2024. Beginning January 1, 2025, the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed. A CECL transitional amount totaling $68.0 million has been added back to CET1 as of December 31, 2021. The CECL transitional amount includes $31.8 million related to the cumulative effect of adopting CECL on January 1, 2020, and $36.2 million related to the estimated incremental effect of CECL since adoption. The CECL transitional amount as of December 31, 2020 totaled $73.4 million.
Share Repurchase Program. On November 13, 2018, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock and on October 15, 2019, the board approved an additional $100.0 million of repurchase authorization. The initial repurchase program expired on March 31, 2020 and the additional $100.0 million authorization expired on December 31, 2020, though it had been suspended since the end of the first quarter of 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Between November 13, 2018 and December 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $82.1 million pursuant to these authorizations. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.8 million. Our last purchase of shares of our common stock occurred on March 19, 2020. On January 19, 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock, pursuant to which we have acquired no shares of our common stock. The authorization for this program will remain in effect through March 31, 2022. On January 18, 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock to commence upon expiration of our existing share repurchase program that is set to expire on March 31, 2022. This authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2023.
Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, Pinnacle Bank may not, without the prior consent of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Pinnacle Bank paid dividends of $99.8 million to us which was within the limits allowed by the TDFI.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $55.5 million in dividends to common shareholders. On January 18, 2022 our board of directors declared a $0.22 quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders (approximately $16.6 million in aggregate) that was paid on February 25, 2022 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 4, 2022.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $15.2 million of dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. On January 18, 2022 our board of directors declared a $16.88 quarterly cash dividend (approximately $3.8 million in aggregate) that will be paid on March 1, 2022 to preferred shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 14, 2022. This dividend equates to $0.422 per share on our depositary shares.
The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results.
If we fail to pay dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.
Market and Liquidity Risk Management
Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.
Interest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model.
Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were several noteworthy factors when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of December 31, 2021, to the modeling results at December 31, 2020:
•The Federal Reserve maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in high levels of on-balance-sheet liquidity.
•We deployed $1.0 billion of liquidity into reverse repo agreements with floating-rate structures.
•We unwound a $1.5 billion in-the-money interest rate floor derivative.
•We slowed growth in our portfolio of in-the-money client loan interest rate floors.
•The fixed-rate PPP loan portfolio declined $1.4 billion with most proceeds transitioning to floating-rate assets.
Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated:
*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound.
While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates.
The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements.
At December 31, 2021, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy.
Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2021, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates:
*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound.Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zed.
While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.
At December 31, 2021, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy.
Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward.
Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.
Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms.
ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario assumes four 25 basis point increases in the Federal Funds Rate during 2022. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time.
We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 14. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments.
Liquidity Risk Management. The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.
To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio.
Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.
Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.
As noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB Cincinnati and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB Cincinnati, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB Cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB Cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB Cincinnati. At December 31, 2021, we believe we had an estimated $3.1 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB Cincinnati; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB Cincinnati.
Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $155.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at December 31, 2021, or during the year then ended, although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically. Pinnacle Bank also had approximately $3.4 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the IntraFiNetwork, we had approximately $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, in brokered deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. During 2020, and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we intentionally increased our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. During the first quarter of 2020, this increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits, increased borrowings from the FHLB Cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits. Core deposit growth during 2020 and 2021 increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of on-balance sheet liquidity. We intend to prepay and/or let mature wholesale funding as core deposit levels allows.
Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods.
At December 31, 2021, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm.
Our short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds) and FHLB Cincinnati advances.
We have certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021, which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2021. Each of these commitments is noted throughout Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis. Our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longer-term as well.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $278.0 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $12.8 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions.
We follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At December 31, 2021, we had accrued $22.5 million related to expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments.
Risk Management
As a financial institution, we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision, transaction and activity. Risk management does not eliminate risk, but seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and reward, including return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. Understanding our risks and managing them appropriately can enhance our ability to make better decisions, deliver on objectives, and improve performance.
Our board of directors and members of senior management have identified major categories of risk: credit risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, operational risk (including IT, Cyber and BSA/AML), compliance risk, asset liability management risk, capital risk, HR employment practices risk and non-bank activities risk. In its oversight role of our risk management function, our board of directors, acting principally, but not exclusively, through a Risk Committee comprised solely of independent directors, focuses on the strategies, analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying, understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value, while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations. The Risk Committee (or in some cases the full board of directors) fulfills the overarching oversight role for the risk management process, including approving risk appetite and tolerance levels, risk policies and limits, monitoring key and emerging risks, and reviewing risk assessment results. We are also committed to understanding the impacts of climate change related to its activities and to partner with the communities in which it operates, to do the same. We expect that climate change will be increasingly impactful over time, and we will monitor closely to understand regulatory, environmental and business partner impacts that influence our business and the clients and communities we serve. In addition, oversight of certain risk is allocated to other committees of the board of directors that meet regularly and report to our board of directors, including the Audit Committee and Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer and provides overall vision, direction and leadership regarding the enterprise risk management framework. The framework includes an Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, and various management-level risk committees that focus on specific areas of risk management. The Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee, which is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Audit Executive, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Credit Officer and including other key leaders responsible for critical operation and support functions, provides management oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management program. Additional management-level risk committees are responsible for effective risk measurement, management and reporting of their respective risk categories. The Chief Risk Officer is an active member of each of the management-level risk committees.
Our board of directors has adopted a risk appetite statement that seeks to balance the amount of risk we are willing take as we seek to achieve our financial performance objectives, i.e. returns. As such, our board of directors, principally acting through the Risk Committee, routinely monitors a host of risk metrics from both business and operational units, as well as by risk category, in an effort to appropriately balance the manner in which our performance aligns with our risk appetite. The Risk Committee and members of senior management, including the Chief Risk Officer, review assessments of our risk ratings within each of our key areas of risk on a regular basis. The Chief Risk Officer’s report to the Risk Committee includes the assessment and direction of risk within each key area, an assessment of critical factors that influence firm risks, emerging risks, as well as the status of risk actions management is taking to mitigate and control key risks. These reviews are done in an effort to ensure performance alignment with our risk appetite, and where appropriate, trigger adjustments to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks approach our desired risk tolerance limits.
We support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our board of directors and senior management. The Risk Committee strives to ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances. The Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing senior management’s establishment and operation of our risk framework and our strategic and capital plans are aligned with the risk appetite approved by our board of directors. The Risk Committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee.
Risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our Risk Committee and Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee. We use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance tactics, while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Our Risk Committee, in collaboration with our Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee, approves our risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently, as needed to reflect changes in the risk environment, with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations, regulatory environment and our shareholders' expectations. Reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans, and our ongoing monitoring thereof, are regularly presented to our various management-level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up to the Risk Committee of our board of directors.
As noted above, we have an Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee comprised of key members of senior management. The purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk within the tolerances and framework established by our Risk Committee and board of directors. The Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee reports on a regular basis to the Risk Committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprise-wide risk profile and other significant risk management issues. Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy and framework and through his work with other senior associates seeks to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a day-to-day basis.
Various departments within Pinnacle Bank, working with our Chief Risk Officer, are responsible for developing policies and procedures to effectively monitor risks within their areas. For instance, our compliance department is responsible for developing policies and procedures and monitoring our compliance with applicable laws and regulations while our information technology department is responsible for maintaining a risk assessment of our information and cyber security risks and ensuring appropriate controls are in place to manage and control such risks, including designing appropriate testing plans to ensure the integrity of information and cyber security controls. Additionally, we are committed to understanding the impacts of climate change related to its activities and to partner with the communities in which it operates, to do the same. Further, our audit function (including our internal audit function) performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our Audit Committee. Both the Risk Committee and Audit Committee of our board of directors regularly report on risk-related matters to the full board of directors. In addition, both the Risk Committee of our board of directors and our Enterprise Wide Risk Management Committee regularly assess our enterprise-wide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues.
Our board of directors believes that our enterprise-wide risk management process is effective and enables the board of directors to:
•assess the quality of the information we receive;
•understand the businesses, investments and financial, accounting, legal, regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that we face;
•oversee and assess how senior management evaluates and manages risk within our risk appetite; and
•assess appropriately the quality of our enterprise-wide risk management process.
Impact of Inflation
The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
