Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a growth-oriented company based in Houston, Texas, that owns and operates market-leading energy and infrastructure businesses. For more information, please read “Part I -Item 1. - Business-Overview” of this Form 10-K.
Known Trends or Uncertainties
While the market indices presented below under “Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations” are representative of the results of our refineries, each refinery’s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis will differ from the benchmark due to a variety of factors that affect the performance of the specific refinery. These factors include, but are not limited to, the actual type and timing of crude oil throughput; product yields; transportation and storage costs; fuel burn; product premiums or discounts; inventory fluctuations; feedstock and product purchases; commodity price risk-management activities; crude oil purchase financing activities; and other factors not reflected in the benchmark refining margin. We operate in logistically complex, niche markets and, as such, each of our refineries has unique cost advantages and disadvantages as compared to their respective relevant market indices.
Recent Events Affecting Comparability of Periods
COVID-19 Pandemic
The ongoing spread of COVID-19, in conjunction with related government and other preventative measures taken to mitigate the spread of the virus, continued to cause severe disruptions in the worldwide economy in 2021, including the global demand for crude oil and refined products, the movement of people and goods in the United States, and the global supply chain for industrial and commercial production, all of which have in turn disrupted our businesses and operations. During 2021, vaccine availability and acceptance and easing of government responses to the pandemic such as travel restrictions led to increased travel in the regions in which we operate. The increase in travel has resulted in higher demand for refined products, an important driver in key aspects of our operations, including sales volumes and the prices of crude oil and refined products. Full recovery to pre-pandemic levels of global demand remains uncertain, however, as additional variants may emerge that cause a resurgence of COVID-19 and travel restrictions continue to limit international travel. For more information, please read “Item 1. - Business - Markets” of this Form 10-K.
We have undertaken additional liquidity-enhancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deferring or delaying certain capital expenditures related to turnaround activities at our Washington refinery. We closed sale-leaseback transactions (the “Sale-Leaseback Transactions”) in the first quarter of 2021, in which we sold twenty-two (22) retail convenience store/fuel station properties located in Hawaii (the “Sale-Leaseback Properties”) for $112.8 million, net of fees. We also entered into a lease on the properties for fifteen (15) years, unless earlier terminated, with up to four 5-year renewal options. On March 19, 2021, we sold 5.75 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $16.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $87.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
We believe the steps we have taken strengthen our ability to operate through current conditions. We continue to maintain existing processes and procedures including, but not limited to, processes and procedures around protection of our technology systems and proprietary data, even though many of our employees are working from home. The health and well-being of our employees and customers are our top priorities as we continue navigating the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The financial results contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect the continued impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced during 2021 in the regions in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and we continue to actively monitor the impacts of the virus on our people, operations, financial condition, liquidity, suppliers, customers, and industry. Due to the rapid development and fluidity of the situation, the full magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on our financial condition, future results of operations, and future cash flows and liquidity is uncertain and has been and may continue to be material.
Washington Acquisition
On January 11, 2019, we completed the Washington Acquisition for total consideration of $326.5 million, including acquired working capital, consisting of cash consideration of $289.5 million and approximately 2.4 million shares of our
common stock with a fair value of $37.0 million issued to the seller of U.S. Oil. The results of operations for U.S. Oil were included in our refining and logistics segments commencing January 11, 2019. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.
In connection with the consummation of the Washington Acquisition, we assumed the Washington Refinery Intermediation Agreement with MLC that provides a structured financing arrangement based on U.S. Oil’s crude oil and refined products inventories and associated accounts receivable. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.
Second Amended and Restated J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreement
Prior to July 1, 2021, under the first amended and restated supply and offtake agreement we had the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron under a deferred payment arrangement up to the lesser of $165 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. On June 1, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Supply and Offtake Agreement (the “Supply and Offtake Agreement”), which provided for a discretionary draw facility to be available to PHR (the “Discretionary Draw Facility”) commencing as of July 1, 2021. Under the Discretionary Draw Facility, J. Aron agreed to make advances to PHR in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of $165 million or the sum of the borrowing base, which is calculated as (x) 85% of the eligible accounts receivables, plus (y) the lesser of $82.5 million and 85% of eligible hydrocarbon inventory, minus (z) such reserves as established by J. Aron in respect of eligible receivables and eligible hydrocarbon inventory. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Loss. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 improved from a net loss of $409.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a net loss of $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The improvement was primarily driven by favorable refined product sales pricing and feedstock costs at our Hawaii refinery, partially offset by higher inventory financing costs at our Washington refinery related to rising inventory financing and product costs. Other factors impacting our results period over period include a 2021 gain on sale of assets of $63.9 million primarily related to the Sale-Leaseback Transactions we closed in the first quarter of 2021, asset impairment charges of $1.8 million in 2021 as compared to our 2020 goodwill impairment of $67.9 million and asset impairment charges of $17.9 million, and an other-than-temporary impairment of $45.3 million related to our equity investment in Laramie Energy in 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA was $61.5 million compared to a loss of $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement was primarily related to favorable realized refined product crack spreads at all our refineries, favorable feedstock, purchased product and derivative costs at our Hawaii refinery, and higher refined product sales volumes at our Wyoming refinery, partially offset by unfavorable inventory financing and environmental compliance costs and higher operating expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted Net Loss was $100.3 million compared to $249.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily related to the same factors described above for the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Income (Loss). Our net income decreased from $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a net loss of $409.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in our net income (loss) was primarily driven by lower refining sales volumes and unfavorable crack spreads related to COVID-19 demand destruction, increased RINs expenses and derivative costs, goodwill and asset impairments of $85.8 million, and an unfavorable change in lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments, partially offset by cost reductions across our businesses in response to COVID-19 and higher retail fuel margins. In addition, we incurred an other-than-temporary impairment of $45.3 million related to our equity investment in Laramie Energy in 2020, as compared to an other-than-temporary impairment of $83.2 million in 2019. Other factors impacting our results period over period include a $49.0 million reduction in our income tax benefit and lower debt extinguishment and commitment costs.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $86.7 million compared to earnings of $258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily
related to lower refining sales volumes and unfavorable crack spreads related to COVID-19 demand destruction, partially offset by lower operating expense and higher retail fuel margins.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was a loss of $249.8 million compared to income of $90.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily related to the same factors described above for the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization (“DD&A”) due to recently completed capital projects, including turnaround projects, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in interest expense and financing costs and a $5.8 million decrease in our Equity losses from Laramie Energy, excluding our share of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives and excluding impairment changes associated with our investment in Laramie Energy.
The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands). The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following tables summarize our operating income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands). The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
________________________________________________________
(1)Our logistics operations consist primarily of intercompany transactions which eliminate on a consolidated basis.
(2)Includes eliminations of intersegment Revenues and Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) of $402.2 million, $306.5 million, and $424.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Below is a summary of key operating statistics for the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
________________________________________________________
(1)Feedstocks throughput and sales volumes per day for the Washington refinery for the year ended December 31, 2019 are calculated based on the 355-day period for which we owned the Washington refinery in 2019. The amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii, Washington, and Wyoming refineries’ throughput or sales volumes averaged over the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
(2)We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput. Adjusted Gross Margin for our Washington refinery is determined under the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory costing method. Adjusted Gross Margin for our other refineries is determined under the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) inventory costing method. Please see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below.
(3)Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations.
(4)In 2020, following the implementation of IMO 2020, we established the 3-1-2 Singapore Crack Spread (or three barrels of Brent crude oil converted into one barrel of gasoline and two barrels of distillates (diesel and jet fuel)) as a new benchmark for our Hawaii operations. By removing the high sulfur fuel oil reference in the index, we believe the 3-1-2 Singapore Crack Spread is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Hawaii.
(5)We believe the Pacific Northwest 5-2-2-1 Index is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Tacoma, Washington. The Pacific Northwest 5-2-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline (sub-octane), two parts middle distillates (ultra-low sulfur diesel (“ULSD”) and jet fuel), and one part fuel oil as created from five barrels of Alaskan North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil. The 2019 prices for the year ended December 31, 2019 represent the price averaged over the period from January 11, 2019 to December 31, 2019.
(6)The profitability of our Wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets. We believe the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Wyoming. The Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillates (ULSD) as created from three barrels of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (“WTI”). Pricing is based 50% on applicable product pricing in Rapid City, South Dakota, and 50% on applicable product pricing in Denver, Colorado.
Below is a summary of key operating statistics for the retail segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
Non-GAAP Performance Measures
Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Adjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) adjusted for operating expense (excluding depreciation); depreciation, depletion, and amortization (“DD&A”); impairment expense; loss (gain) on sale of assets, net; inventory valuation adjustment (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase or terminal obligations, contango (gains) and backwardation losses associated with our Washington inventory and intermediation obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments); LIFO layer liquidation impacts associated with our Washington inventory; Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) loss (gain) in excess of net obligation (which represents the income statement effect of reflecting our RINs liability on a net basis); and unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) plus inventory valuation adjustment, unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives, LIFO layer liquidation impacts associated with our Washington inventory, and RINs loss (gain) in excess of net obligation. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINs and environmental credit obligations, and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and the inventory valuation adjustment that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin. Beginning in 2020, Adjusted Gross Margin also includes the contango gains and backwardation losses associated with our Washington inventory and intermediation obligation. Prior to 2020, contango gains, and backwardation (losses) captured by our Washington intermediation agreement were excluded from Adjusted Gross Margin (as part of the inventory valuation adjustment). This change to our non-GAAP information was made to reflect the favorable or unfavorable impact of the market structure on the profitability of our Washington refinery consistent with the presentation of such impacts on our other refineries. Also beginning in 2020, Adjusted Gross Margin excludes the LIFO layer liquidation impacts associated with our Washington inventory. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the year ended December 31, 2019 to conform to the current period presentation.
Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreements and lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.
Adjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross
Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.
The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):
________________________________________
(1) For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there was no LIFO liquidation adjustment. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no loss (gain) on sale of assets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no impairment expense.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as Net income (loss) excluding inventory valuation adjustment (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase or terminal obligations, contango (gains) and backwardation losses associated with our Washington inventory and intermediation obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), the LIFO layer liquidation impacts associated with our Washington inventory, RINs loss (gain) in excess of net obligation, unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives, acquisition and integration costs, debt extinguishment and commitment costs, increase in (release of) tax valuation allowance and other deferred tax items, changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants, severance costs, (gain) loss on sale of assets, impairment expense, impairment expense associated with our investment in Laramie Energy and our share of Laramie Energy’s asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference, and Par’s share of Laramie Energy’s unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives. Beginning in 2020, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) also includes the contango gains and backwardation
losses associated with our Washington inventory and intermediation obligation. Prior to 2020, contango gains, and backwardation (losses) captured by our Washington intermediation agreement were excluded from Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (as part of the inventory valuation adjustment). This change to our non-GAAP information was made to reflect the favorable or unfavorable impact of the market structure on the profitability of our Washington refinery consistent with the presentation of such impacts on our other refineries. Also beginning in 2020, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excludes the LIFO layer liquidation impacts associated with our Washington inventory. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the year ended December 31, 2019 to conform to the current period presentation.
Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding DD&A, interest expense and financing costs, equity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy excluding Par’s share of unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives, impairment of Par’s investment, and our share of Laramie Energy’s asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference, and income tax expense (benefit).
We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess:
•The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis;
•The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and
•Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing, and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):
________________________________________________________
(1)Includes releases of our valuation allowance associated with business combinations and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are not offset by a change in the valuation allowance. These tax benefits are included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations.
(2)Includes our share of Laramie Energy’s unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives, impairment losses on our investment in Laramie Energy, and our share of Laramie Energy’s asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference. These impairment losses and our share of Laramie Energy’s unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives are included in Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our consolidated statements of operations.
(3)For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, there was no LIFO liquidation adjustment or change in value of contingent consideration.
Discussion of Operating Income (Loss) by Segment
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Refining. Operating loss for our refining segment was $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an improvement of $243.0 million compared to operating loss of $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in profitability was primarily driven by favorable realized product crack spreads across all our refineries, favorable purchased product and feedstock costs at our Hawaii refinery, favorable derivative costs, and a 28% increase in refining sales volume at our Wyoming refinery, partially offset by higher inventory financing costs related to the rising cost of crude oil. Other factors impacting our results period over period include asset impairment charges of $1.8 million in 2021 from discontinued capital projects as compared to our 2020 goodwill impairment of $38.1 million and asset impairment charges of $17.9 million, and a 2021 gain on sale of assets of $19.7 million primarily related to the Sale-Leaseback Transactions we closed in the first quarter of 2021.
Logistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $16.2 million compared to operating income of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is
primarily due to net 12% and 32% higher throughput across our Hawaii and Wyoming logistics assets, respectively, related to increased demand as a result of reduced COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lower lease costs on barges in Hawaii.
Retail. Operating income for our retail segment was $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $57.0 million compared to operating income of $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in profitability was primarily due to a gain on sale of assets of $45.0 million primarily related to the Sale-Leaseback Transactions we closed in the first quarter of 2021, a 2020 goodwill impairment of $29.8 million with no corresponding impairment in 2021, and an increase in sales volumes of 6%, partially offset by a decrease in fuel margins of 17% related to rising fuel costs and market-driven margin compression and additional rent expense related to the Sale-Leaseback Transactions that we closed in the first quarter of 2021.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Refining. Operating loss for our refining segment was $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $425.6 million compared to operating income of $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profitability was primarily driven by lower refining sales volumes at our Hawaii and Wyoming refineries related to COVID-19 demand destruction and turnarounds in both locations, unfavorable crude oil differentials and crack spreads, increased RINs expenses and derivative costs, goodwill impairment charges of $38.1 million, asset impairment charges of $17.9 million, and unfavorable lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments of $10.6 million, partially offset by improved energy-related cost of sales and operating expense reductions across our refineries in response to COVID-19.
Logistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $24.1 million compared to operating income of $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a net 30% and 25% lower throughput across our Hawaii and Wyoming logistics assets, respectively, and lower neighbor island sales in Hawaii related to COVID-19 demand destruction, major turnarounds in both locations, and higher DD&A, partially offset by a net 9% increase in throughput across our Washington logistics assets.
Retail. Operating income for our retail segment was $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $25.0 million compared to operating income of $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to goodwill impairment charges of $29.8 million and an 18% decline in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in fuel margins of 25% and operating expense reductions in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses.
Discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin by Segment
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Refining. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $200.3 million, an increase of $169.2 million compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in profitability was primarily driven by favorable realized product crack spreads across all our refineries and favorable feedstock and purchased product costs in Hawaii, partially offset by unfavorable feedstock and inventory financing costs in Washington. Adjusted gross margin for the Hawaii refinery improved from $(1.63) per barrel in 2020 to $3.24 per barrel in 2021 primarily due to favorable product crack spreads and feedstock, purchased product, and derivative costs. Adjusted gross margin for the Wyoming refinery increased by $8.72 per barrel primarily due to favorable product crack spreads and a 28% increase in sales volumes. Adjusted gross margin for the Washington refinery decreased by $1.92 per barrel primarily due to higher inventory financing and feedstock costs, partially offset by favorable realized product crack spreads and lower logistics costs.
Logistics. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $87.9 million, an increase of $17.4 million compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by net 12% and 32% higher throughput across our Hawaii and Wyoming logistics assets, respectively, due to increased sales volumes in both regions driven by reduced COVID-19-related travel restrictions, and lower lease costs on barges in Hawaii.
Retail. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $118.9 million, a decrease of $9.9 million compared to $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a 17% decrease in fuel margins due to rising fuel costs and market-driven margin compression, partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volumes.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Refining. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $31.1 million, a decrease of $370.6 million compared to $401.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profitability was primarily driven by a 23% decline in sales volumes and declines in crack spreads. Adjusted gross margin for the Hawaii refinery decreased from $3.30 per barrel in 2019 to $(1.63) per barrel in 2020 primarily due to 30% lower sales volumes, an increase in RINs expenses, and unfavorable crude oil differentials. Adjusted gross margin for the Wyoming refinery decreased $14.88 per barrel primarily due to a 24% decline in sales volumes, an increase in RINs expenses, and a decrease in crack spreads. The decline in refining sales volumes in Hawaii and Wyoming was driven by COVID-19 demand destruction and turnarounds in both locations. Adjusted gross margin for the Washington refinery decreased $7.38 per barrel primarily due to unfavorable crack spreads and higher RINs expenses, partially offset by favorable derivative costs.
Logistics. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $70.5 million, a decrease of $16.6 million compared to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a net 30% and 25% lower throughput across our Hawaii and Wyoming logistics assets, respectively, and lower neighbor island sales in Hawaii related to COVID-19 demand destruction and major turnarounds at both locations, partially offset by a net 9% increase in throughput across our Washington logistics assets.
Retail. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $128.8 million, an increase of $2.2 million compared to $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 25% increase in fuel margins, partially offset by a decline in sales volumes of 18% due to COVID-19 demand destruction.
Discussion of Consolidated Results
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues were $4.7 billion, a $1.6 billion increase compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of $1.5 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment primarily as a result of increases in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. Brent crude oil prices recovered from COVID-19-related lows, averaging $70.95 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $43.21 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020, and WTI crude oil prices averaged $68.11 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $39.65 in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other factors contributing to the increase in revenues at our refining segment include a 28% increase in refining sales volume at our Wyoming refinery and improved realized product crack spreads across all our refineries. Revenues in our retail segment increased $92.7 million primarily due to a 23% increase in fuel prices and a 6% increase in sales volume.
Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) was $4.3 billion, a $1.4 billion increase compared to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases in Brent and WTI crude oil prices and refining sales volumes at our Wyoming refinery as discussed above, higher inventory financing costs, and 6% higher sales volumes at our Retail segment, partially offset by favorable purchased product and feedstock costs at our Hawaii refinery and favorable derivative costs.
Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $299.7 million, an increase of $22.3 million compared to $277.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher utilities and maintenance expenses at our Hawaii refinery and increased rent expenses driven by new leases from the Sale-Leaseback Transactions we completed in the first quarter of 2021.
Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, DD&A expense was approximately $94.2 million, an increase of $4.2 million compared to $90.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to amortization of our Hawaii refinery turnaround completed in 2020.
Impairment Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded asset impairment charges of $1.8 million primarily related to discontinued capital projects. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $85.8 million related to our Refining and Retail segments.

Gain on Sale of Assets, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the gain on sale of assets, net was approximately $64.7 million and primarily related to the gain recognized as a result of the Sale-Leaseback Transactions we closed on
February 23 and March 12, 2021. Please read Note 16-Leases to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the Sale-Leaseback Transactions. No such transaction occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $48.1 million, an increase of $6.8 million compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher employee costs, an increase in the use of outside services, and higher information technology infrastructure costs.
Interest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $66.5 million, a decrease of $3.7 million compared to $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances driven by the maturity of our outstanding 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes in June 2021, the repayment of the PHL, Mid Pac, and Retail Property Term Loans and interest rate swap related to the Retail Property Term Loan in the first quarter of 2021, and quarterly principal payments on our Term Loan B Facility. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense related to the 12.875% Senior Secured Notes issued in June 2020 and an increase of $1.1 million related to increased borrowings under our inventory financing agreements. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements and Note 13-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our inventory financing and indebtedness, respectively.
Change in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a gain of $4.3 million. During January and March 2020, one of our stockholders and its affiliates exercised the remaining 354,350 common stock warrants in exchange for 350,542 shares of common stock. We estimated the fair value of our outstanding common stock warrants and the income recognized upon exercise using the difference between the strike price of the warrant and the market price of our common stock.

Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an income tax expense of $1.0 million primarily driven by foreign withholding taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $20.7 million primarily driven by an increase in our net operating loss carryforwards that do not expire and the change in our indefinitely-lived goodwill due to the impairments.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues were $3.1 billion, a $2.3 billion decrease compared to $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $2.2 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment primarily as a result of decreases in Brent and WTI crude oil prices and lower sales volumes related to COVID-19 demand destruction. Refined product sales volumes decreased 23% from 176.8 Mbpd in the year
ended December 31, 2019 to 136.7 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2020. Brent crude oil prices averaged $43.21 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $64.19 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2019, with similar decreases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Revenues in our retail segment decreased $95.2 million primarily due to 18% declines in both sales volumes and fuel prices.
Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation), was $2.9 billion, a $1.9 billion decrease compared to $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in Brent and WTI crude oil prices and lower refining sales volumes discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil differentials, higher RINs expenses, increased derivative costs, and an unfavorable lower of cost and net realizable value adjustment of $10.6 million. Cost of revenues at our retail segment decreased $97.4 million primarily due to lower fuel costs and an 18% decline in sales volumes.
Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $277.4 million, a decrease of $35.5 million compared to $312.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses and COVID-19- related reductions in travel, employee costs, and the use of outside services.
Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2020, DD&A expense was approximately $90.0 million, an increase of $3.9 million compared to $86.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to recently completed capital projects, including three turnarounds during 2019 and 2020 and our Washington renewables logistics project.
Impairment Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $85.8 million related to our Refining and Retail segments.

The decrease was primarily due to COVID-19-related reductions in travel and employee costs and a reduction in the use of outside services.
Acquisition and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred approximately $0.6 million of expenses primarily related to integration costs for the Washington Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $4.7 million of expenses primarily related to acquisition and integration costs for the Washington and Par West Acquisitions. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.
Interest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $70.2 million, a decrease of $4.6 million compared to $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in due to the exchange of a portion of our outstanding 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes during 2019, a decrease of $4.7 million due to reduced borrowings under our inventory financing agreements, and a decrease of $4.3 million due to the reduced principal and lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan B Facility. These decreases were partially offset by interest expense of $8.1 million related to the 12.875% Senior Secured Notes issued in June 2020. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements and Note 13-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our inventory financing and indebtedness, respectively.

Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
On December 21, 2017, Par Petroleum, LLC (the “Issuer”) issued its 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. On January 11, 2019, the Issuers (defined below) entered into a term loan and guaranty agreement with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto with respect to a $250.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan B”). On June 5, 2020, the Issuers issued their 12.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 in a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, the Term Loan B, and the 12.875% Senior Secured Notes were co-issued by Par Petroleum Finance Corp. (together with the Issuer, the “Issuers”), which has no independent assets or operations. The 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, Term Loan B, and 12.875% Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis only as to payment of principal and interest by Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (the “Parent”) and are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the subsidiaries of Par Petroleum, LLC (other than Par Petroleum Finance Corp.).
The following supplemental condensed consolidating financial information reflects (i) the Parent’s separate accounts, (ii) Par Petroleum, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries’ accounts (which are all guarantors of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, Term Loan B, and 12.875% Senior Secured Notes), (iii) the accounts of subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, Term Loan B, or 12.875% Senior Secured Notes and consolidating adjustments and eliminations, and (iv) the Parent’s consolidated accounts for the dates and periods indicated. For purposes of the following condensed consolidating information, the Parent’s investment in its subsidiaries is accounted for under the equity method of accounting (dollar amounts in thousands).
________________________________________________________
(1) The income tax benefit (expense) of the Parent Guarantor and Issuer and Subsidiaries is determined using the separate return method. The Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and Eliminations column includes tax benefits recognized at the Par consolidated level that are primarily associated with changes to the consolidated valuation allowance and other deferred tax balances.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA for the supplemental consolidating condensed financial information, which is segregated at the “Parent Guarantor,” “Issuer and Subsidiaries,” and “Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and Eliminations” levels, is calculated in the same manner as for the Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. Adjusted EBITDA calculations. See “Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Performance Measures - Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA” above.
The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):
________________________________________________________
(1)Includes increases in (releases of) our valuation allowance associated with business combinations and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are not offset by a change in the valuation allowance. These tax expenses (benefits) are included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations.
(2)Includes impairment losses on our investment in Laramie Energy and our share of Laramie Energy’s asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference. These impairment losses and our share of Laramie Energy’s unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives are included in Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our consolidated statements of operations.
(3)For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no changes in valuation allowance and other deferred tax items, changes in value of common stock warrants, or equity losses from Laramie Energy, including impairment losses and our share of Laramie Energy’s unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no debt extinguishment and commitment costs or losses (gains) on sale of assets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no impairment expense or severance costs. There was no LIFO liquidation adjustment or change in value of contingent consideration for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements and contractual obligations, capital expenditures, turnaround outlays, and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs, and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements, and access to capital markets.
Our liquidity position as of December 31, 2021 was $178.7 million and consisted of $174.6 million at Par Petroleum, LLC and subsidiaries, $4.1 million at Par Pacific Holdings, and an immaterial amount at all our other subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2021, we had access to the J. Aron Discretionary Draw Facility, the ABL Credit Facility, the MLC receivable advances, and cash on hand of $112.2 million. In addition, we have the Supply and Offtake Agreement with J. Aron and the Washington Refinery Intermediation Agreement, which are used to finance the majority of the inventory at our Hawaii and Washington refineries, respectively. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our refining and retail segments, payments related to acquisitions, and to repay or refinance indebtedness.
We believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital and turnaround expenditures, working capital, and debt service requirements for the next 12 months. We may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost.
In the first quarter of 2021, we closed on the sale and leaseback of twenty-two (22) of our retail properties in Hawaii for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $112.8 million net of transaction fees (the “Sale-Leaseback Transactions”). We used approximately $53.1 million of the net cash proceeds to repay the certain financing arrangements which were related to certain of the retail properties and the remainder for general corporate purposes. Please read Note 16-Leases to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion on the Sale-Leaseback Transactions.
On March 19, 2021, we sold 5.75 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $87.2 million (the “Equity Offering”), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the Equity Offering to repay the remaining $48.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes at maturity in June 2021 and $36.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.875% Senior Secured Notes, and the remainder for other general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, and funding working capital. Please read Note 18-Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion on the Equity Offering.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had significant activity related to our inventory financing and debt agreements. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements and Note 13-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of significant activity related to our inventory financing and debt agreements, respectively.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, our 12.875% Senior Secured Notes, or our common stock through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. On November 10, 2021, the Board authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $50 million of the currently outstanding shares of our common stock, with no specified end date. Please read Note 18-Stockholders’ Equity for further information. The Term Loan B Facility may also require annual prepayments of principal with a variable percentage of our excess cash flow, 50% or 25% depending on our consolidated year end secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Term Loan B Facility agreement).
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes cash activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted from a net loss of approximately $81.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges to operations of approximately $41.6 million and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $12.1 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a net increase in our Supply and Offtake Agreement and Washington Refinery Intermediation Agreement obligations of $252.9 million, an increase in our environmental credit obligations of $160.5 million, and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $49.0 million, partially offset by an increase in inventories of $350.7 million, an increase in our trade receivables of $84.0 million, and $9.5 million in deferred turnaround costs associated with the Hawaii and Wyoming turnarounds. The increases in accounts receivable, inventory, Supply and Offtake Agreement, and accounts payable and other current liabilities were primarily driven by the increases in crude oil prices in 2021 and an overall increase in sales, purchases, and inventory volumes. The increase in our environmental credit obligations was primarily driven by current year production and increases in RINs prices. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted from a net loss of approximately $409.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges to operations of approximately $219.1 million and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $152.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which resulted from net income of approximately $40.8 million and non-cash charges to operations of approximately $144.9 million, partially offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $80.1 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $74.6 million and primarily related to proceeds received from the Sale-Leaseback Transactions partially offset by additions to property, plant, and equipment totaling approximately $29.5 million.

Aron deferred payment arrangement and Discretionary Draw Facility, and MLC receivable advances of $81.4 million and $5.6 million in extinguishment costs related to the repayment of the Retail Property Term Loan and a portion of the 12.875% Senior Secured Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $42.6 million consisted primarily of proceeds from net borrowings on our debt agreements, J. Aron deferred payment arrangement, and MLC receivable advances of $49.3 million, partially offset by deferred loan costs of $6.3 million related to the issuance of the 12.875% Senior Secured Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $300.2 million consisted primarily of proceeds from net borrowings on our debt agreements, J. Aron deferred payment arrangement, and MLC receivable advances of $313.0 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $8.2 million, partially offset by deferred loan costs of $13.5 million and payments of $8.1 million in commitment and other fees related to the funding for the Washington Acquisition and the financing costs related to the repurchase and cancellation of a portion of our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes.
Cash Requirements
We have various cash requirements stemming from investment strategies, contractual obligations, and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These cash requirements and obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly related to our operating activities. We also continue to seek strategic investments in business opportunities, however the amount and timing of those investments are not predictable. Our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 include:
Debt and Interest Payments. Current and long-term debt includes the scheduled principal payments related to our outstanding debt obligations and letters of credit. Our estimated interest payments due for 2022 are $46.6 million and our total estimated undiscounted future interest payments will be $194.0 million on the debt obligations held as of December 31, 2021 and using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021. Please read Note 13-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Capital Expenditures and Turnaround Costs. Our deferred turnaround costs and capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, for the year ended December 31, 2021, totaled approximately $39.0 million and were primarily related to the 2021 turnaround and related scheduled maintenance work at our Washington refinery, capital projects at our Hawaii refinery, and underground tank replacements, rebranding, and point of sale and other equipment upgrades at our Retail segment. Our capital expenditures and deferred turnaround costs budget for 2022 ranges from $70 to $80 million and primarily relates to the 2022 turnaround at our Washington refinery, scheduled maintenance, and other capital projects related to regulatory compliance, information technology, and growth. We expect to spend approximately $35 to $45 million annually on maintenance and sustaining capital projects and approximately $80 to $90 million on planned turnaround expenditures over the next five years.
Operating Lease Liabilities.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have identified certain estimates as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. We analyze our estimates on a periodic basis, including those related to fair value, impairments, natural gas and crude oil reserves, bad debts, natural gas and oil properties, income taxes, derivatives, contingencies, and litigation and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Inventory and Obligations Under Inventory Financing Agreements
Commodity inventories, excluding commodity inventories at the Washington refinery, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the FIFO accounting method. Commodity inventories at the Washington refinery are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the LIFO inventory accounting method. We value merchandise along with spare parts, materials, and supplies at average cost. Estimating the net realizable value of our inventory requires management to make assumptions about the timing of sales and the expected proceeds that will be realized for these sales. Please read Note 6-Inventories to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
All of the crude oil utilized at the Hawaii refinery is financed by J. Aron under procurement contracts. The crude oil remains in the legal title of J. Aron and is stored in our storage tanks governed by a storage agreement. Legal title to the crude oil passes to us at the tank outlet. After processing, J. Aron takes title to the refined products stored in our storage tanks until they are sold to our retail locations or to third parties. We record the inventory owned by J. Aron on our behalf as inventory with a corresponding accrued liability on our balance sheet because we maintain the risk of loss until the refined products are sold to third parties and we have an obligation to repurchase it. The valuation of our repurchase obligation requires that we make estimates of the prices and differentials assuming settlement occurs at the end of the reporting period.
In connection with the consummation of the Washington Acquisition, we became a party to the Washington Refinery Intermediation Agreement with MLC. Under this arrangement, U.S. Oil purchases crude oil supplied from third-party suppliers and MLC provides credit support for certain of these purchases. U.S. Oil holds title to all crude oil and refined products inventories at all times and pledges such inventories, together with all receivables arising from the sales of these inventories, exclusively to MLC. The valuation of our terminal obligation requires that we make estimates of the prices and differentials for our then monthly forward purchase obligations.

Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain assets and liabilities at their fair market value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include derivative instruments and environmental credit obligations. We also measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when specific triggering events occur, such as business combinations and events which indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In estimating fair value, we use discounted cash flow projections, recent comparable market transactions, if available, or quoted prices. We consider assumptions that third parties would make in estimating fair value, including the highest and best use of the asset. The assumptions used by another party could differ significantly from our assumptions.
We classify fair value balances based on the classification of the inputs used to calculate the fair value of a transaction. The inputs used to measure fair value have been placed in a hierarchy based on priority. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted, readily observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Please read Note 15-Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Business Combinations
We recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations separately from goodwill at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. We obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspectives of marketplace participants. These valuation methods require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding characteristics of the acquired property and future revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions would result in different amounts allocated to the related assets and liabilities. The measurement period may be up to one year from the acquisition date; we may record adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation during this time, concluding at the end of the one year period or final determination of the values of consideration transferred and asses and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first. Subsequent adjustments, if any, are recorded to the consolidated statement of operations. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions and Note 15-Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets
We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. Under the quantitative test, we compare the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the present value of expected future cash flows using a market participant discount rate. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value using observable multiples for comparable companies within our industry. These valuation methods require us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, capital projects, commodity prices, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. Please read Note 10-Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information, including the goodwill impairment we recorded in the first quarter of 2020.
We review property, plant, and equipment, operating leases, and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We use a cash flows model to estimate value because there is usually a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets. Future cash flows estimates used for impairment reviews are based on assessments requiring judgment, including future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates, expected capital expenditures, and other factors based on all available information available as of the date of the review. Impairment is indicated when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying value. If this occurs, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value. The fair value of long-lived assets is determined using the income approach. Please read Note 8-Property, Plant, and Equipment and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information, including the asset impairment we recorded in the first quarter of 2020.
Impairment of our Investment in Laramie Energy
We evaluate our investment in Laramie Energy for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment has occurred and the carrying amount of our investment may not be recoverable. The fair value of our investment in Laramie Energy is determined using the income approach and/or the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the present value of expected future cash flows using a market participant discount rate. Other significant inputs used in the income approach include proved and unproved reserves information and forecasts of operating expenditures obtained from Laramie Energy's management. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value using observable multiples for comparable companies within our industry. These valuation methods require us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, capital projects, commodity prices, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. An impairment loss, based on the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the investment, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Please read Note 3-Investment in Laramie Energy, LLC to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations
We record liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably
estimated. Cost estimates are based on the expected timing and extent of remedial actions required by governing agencies, experience gained from similar sites for which environmental assessments or remediation have been completed, and the amount of our anticipated liability considering the proportional liability and financial abilities of other responsible parties. Usually, the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. Please read Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about our environmental liabilities and assessments.
We record asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) at fair value in the period in which we have a legal obligation, whether by government action or contractual arrangement, to incur these costs and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. Estimating the cost and timing of future remedial efforts is difficult and related technologies, costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, timing, discount rates, and other inputs into the valuations are subject to change. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carry forwards. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly based on a “more likely than not” standard and, to the extent this threshold is not met, a valuation allowance is recorded. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. These liabilities are recorded based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible and may vary from our estimates for a number of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations. New tax laws and regulations, and changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are proposed and promulgated continuously. The implementation of future tax laws and regulatory initiatives, as well as future interpretations on historical tax laws and regulations, could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, “Income Taxes,” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future results of operations over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, among other factors, management concluded that we did not meet the “more likely than not” requirement in order to recognize deferred tax assets and therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
