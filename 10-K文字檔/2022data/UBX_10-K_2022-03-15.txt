Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” and our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company engaged in researching and developing therapeutics to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. Our initial focus is on creating senolytic medicines to selectively eliminate senescent cells and thereby treat diseases of aging, such as ophthalmologic diseases.
In July 2020, we filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to commence a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, single-ascending dose study of UBX1325 in patients with advanced diabetic macular edema, or DME, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or nAMD. UBX1325 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulatory proteins. Our goal with UBX1325 is to transformationally improve real-world outcomes for patients with DME, nAMD, and diabetic retinopathy, or DR. In October 2020, we dosed our first patient in a Phase 1 clinical study of UBX1325 to evaluate ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325 by the incidence of dose limiting toxicities and treatment emergent adverse events reported up to 24 weeks after administration. Based on prospectively determined safety criteria, the Phase 1 study was able to dose-escalate beyond the originally planned 5 mcg dose up to 10 mcg, which informed the final dose for the Phase 2a study in DME. In July 2021, we announced positive data from this Phase 1 study of UBX1325 in patients with DME and nAMD for whom anti-VEGF therapy was no longer considered beneficial. On October 5, 2021 we announced 12-week data, on November 9, 2021 we announced 24-week data, and on February 14, 2022 we announced 24-week data from an additionally-enrolled cohort of patients with AMD. UBX1325 was well-tolerated with no signs of intraocular inflammation or other related ocular adversities, and no dose-limiting toxicities or adversities that preclude advancing UBX1325 into later stage clinical development. In DME, following a rapid improvement in BCVA, a mean improvement of 9.5 ETDRS letters from baseline at 6 months in the higher dose cohorts (5, 10 mcg) and 6.9 ETDRS letters from baseline at 6 months in all dose cohorts was observed. In AMD, following a rapid improvement in BCVA, there were improvements or stabilization of both BCVA and CST through 6 months post-injection. In both diseases, the majority of patients treated with UBX1325 showed durable improvement in vision and did not meet objective rescue criteria requiring standard of care anti-VEGF treatment. Among patients who received anti-VEGF rescue, there was minimal change in either mean BCVA or CST following treatment in all but one patient.
In May 2021, we initiated our Phase 2a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325 in a broader population of patients with DME and dosed our first patient in June 2021. Approximately 62 patients will be enrolled, randomized evenly between UBX1325 and sham-injected patients. An analysis of 12-week safety and efficacy data is expected by mid-2022, and patients will continue to be followed through 48 weeks post-treatment in a long-term follow-up. Endpoints being explored in the study include safety and tolerability, changes in BCVA, CST, SRF/IRF, proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment, and durability of effects.
In March 2022 we also enrolled our first patient in our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in nAMD. This study is expected to randomize 46 patients with wet AMD who have had at least three intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF therapy in the preceding six months and who have residual sub- or intra-retinal fluid. Patients will have received their last anti-VEGF treatment approximately 4-8 weeks prior to screening, and all patients will be followed for approximately 24 weeks after dosing with either UBX1325 or aflibercept. We expect to share 16-week data from this Ph2 study in wet AMD in the fourth quarter of 2022.
In February 2022, we announced a restructuring to align resources to focus on our ongoing clinical programs and deliver on key development milestones. These actions to prioritize our ophthalmology programs and implement cost saving measures were designed to enable us to achieve multiple key clinical data readouts for UBX1325 as well as support the Tie2 and Tie2/VEGF bispecific program through advanced candidate nomination, with all other pipeline programs paused to focus resources on these advanced programs.
Since the commencement of our operations, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities, and we have incurred net losses each year since inception. Our net losses were $60.7 million and $93.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not have any products approved for sale, and we have never generated any revenue from contracts with customers. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $400.0 million, and we do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future.
Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing capital resources will fund our planned operating expenses into the first quarter of 2023 which is expected to fund key clinical data readouts for UBX1325, but less than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. As a result, we will need to raise additional capital. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainty and potential for local and/or global economic recession. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we could be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.
We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts, advance our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. We do not expect to generate revenue from any drug candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such drug candidates and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties.
We rely on third parties in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our drug candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, many of whom are single-source suppliers, for our preclinical and clinical trial materials, as well as the commercial supply of our products. In addition, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, we will incur significant expenses to develop a marketing and sales organization and commercial infrastructure in advance of generating any product sales.
COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed strains on the providers of healthcare services, including the healthcare institutions, clinical research organizations, or CROs, and Institutional Review Boards under whose auspices we conduct our clinical trials. These strains have resulted in limits on the initiation of new clinical trials, slowing or halting enrollment in existing trials and restrictions placed upon on-site monitoring activities of clinical trials. Prior to the initiation of our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of UBX1325, we amended the clinical study protocols to enable remote data collection for clinical sites that were limited in their ability to conduct study visits in person, for either site or patient safety reasons. We also instituted remote data source verification procedures to limit the extent that on-site monitoring was required.
Although we rely on third party manufacturers to supply UBX1325, there have been no disruptions in our supply chain of drug manufacturers necessary to conduct our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of UBX1325, and we believe we have sufficient supply of drug inventories to complete our current studies in ophthalmologic disease.
In late February 2020, we created an internal, cross-functional COVID-19 Response Team to closely monitor the evolving situation and manage our response in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local guidance. We have implemented protocols designed to reduce onsite staff, increased testing and monitoring, facilitated remote working and will continue to monitor the situation and plan for re-entry as permitted by applicable laws or regulations and consistent with the best interests of our employees and business needs.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our drug candidates, which include:
•
personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, severance and stock-based compensation for personnel contributing to research and development activities;
•
laboratory expenses including supplies and services;
•
clinical trial expenses;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, contract research organizations, research and development service providers, academic research institutions, and consultants;
•
expenses related to license and sponsored research agreements; and
•
facilities and other allocated expenses, including expenses for rent and facilities maintenance, and depreciation and amortization.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we advance our drug candidates into and through preclinical and clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our drug candidates. The process of conducting the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. Clinical trials generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages and we are required to make estimates for expense accruals related to clinical trial expenses. The actual probability of success for our drug candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including: the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, the ability of collaborators, if any, to successfully develop any drug candidates we license to them, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates. Program costs that are direct external expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis once they enter clinical studies. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services, and depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation. We expect to continue to incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services.
Change Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
Certain of our license agreements include contingent consideration in the form of additional issuances of our common stock based on the achievement of certain milestones. For asset acquisitions, we assess whether such contingent consideration obligation meets the definition of a derivative and/or can be equity classified, until such time that the contingency or equity classification criteria is met or expires. We have recorded a liability related to contingent consideration as the net settlement criteria of the definition of a derivative had been met and equity classification criteria had not been met. The derivative related to this contingent consideration was measured at fair value as of each balance sheet date with the related change in fair value being reflected in operating results. Gains or
losses on contingent consideration expense is driven by changes in the estimated fair value of the liability, which is determined using a probability-weighted valuation approach model that reflects the probability and timing of future issuances of our common shares.
Interest Income
Interest income is primarily related to interest earned on our marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Interest Expense
Interest expense relates to interest on the Loan Agreement entered into during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income (Expense), Net
We held an equity investment in an entity called Ascentage Pharma Group International, or Ascentage International, an affiliate of a Hong Kong based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company called Ascentage Pharma Group Corp. Limited. In October 2019, Ascentage International completed an initial public offering of shares of its common stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Following the initial public offering, the underlying nature of our investment in Ascentage International changed and met the definition of an investment in an equity security with a readily determinable fair value to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based on quoted stock prices available on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold our entire equity investment in Ascentage International. Other expense in 2020 includes the recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale of the investment in this equity security and the previous changes in fair value, while other expense in 2021 includes the commitment share expenses related to the equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund and the debt extinguishment loss from the conversion of debt to equity.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations (in thousands):
Licensing Revenue - Related Party
In December 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with Jocasta Neuroscience, Inc. (“Jocasta”) pursuant to which we exclusively licensed all of our rights to UBX2089, our α-Klotho asset. The agreement provided for an upfront fee of $5.0 million. Revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to grant of license and delivery of the know-how performance obligation under the License Agreement. We recognized revenue of $4.8 million and zero for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to grant of license and delivery of the know-how performance obligation under the License Agreement entered into with Jocasta in December 2021.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses decreased by $28.9 million, to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $11.9 million in direct research and development expenses mainly due to termination of Osteoarthritis studies and decreased safety studies, $10.2 million in personnel costs due to reduction in force, $3.8 million in facilities-related costs primarily due to allocation to general and administrative expenses of net expenses on Brisbane and East Grand facilities which have been subleased, $2.5 million in laboratory supplies and $0.5 million in consultant expenses.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.0 million, to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $0.8 million in professional fees, $0.3 million in personnel-related expenses and $0.1 million in facilities-related costs, offset by $0.2 million increase in insurance-related expense.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
There was no contingent consideration liability at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2020, and was primarily due to changes in our stock price.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Impairment charges consisted of impairment of long-lived assets. There were no impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.6 million after evaluating the right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements upon exit of our former headquarters located in Brisbane, California.
Interest Income
Our interest income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower market yields and cash balances on the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense of $3.2 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is related to the Loan Agreement.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other expense, net, was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 which includes $0.8 million commitment share expenses related to the equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund and $0.3 million property and other tax expense, offset by $0.2 million gain from the debt extinguishment from the conversion of debt to equity and the sale of assets. Other income, net, was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our investment in the common stock of Ascentage International. The entire investment was sold in 2020.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations (in thousands):
Research and Development
Research and development expenses decreased by $3.6 million, to $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $5.3 million in direct research and development expenses mainly due to lower pre-clinical research and development activities and contract manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher costs from clinical programs started in late 2019. Laboratory supplies decreased by $1.9 million and facilities-related costs increased by $2.2 million. Personnel-related expenses increased by $1.4 million, of which $1.6 million was related to non-cash stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in payroll due to the corporate restructuring and other costs such as travel, due to employees working from home.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased by $4.0 million, to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases of $2.0 million in personnel-related expenses, of which $1.4 million was related to non-cash stock compensation expense, $0.8 million in professional fees, $0.7 million in facilities-related costs and $0.5 million in insurance-related expense.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
Change in fair value of contingent consideration reflects a decrease in the contingent consideration liability of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We issued shares in 2020 as a result of meeting a contractual milestone. The change in the fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to changes in assumptions, including probabilities, and our stock price used to calculate the fair value of the liability. Additionally, during the
third quarter of 2020, we made changes to the related contracts, which resulted in there being no contingent consideration liability at December 31, 2020.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Impairment charges consisted of impairment of long-lived assets. We evaluated the right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements upon exit of our former headquarters located in Brisbane, California, and recorded an impairment charge of $2.6 million during the year.
Interest Income
Our interest income was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower market yields and cash balances on the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 is related to the Loan Agreement.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a change in the fair value of our investment in the common stock of Ascentage International.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Requirements
Sources of Liquidity
We have incurred net losses each year since inception. We do not have any products approved for sale and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Historically, we have incurred operating losses as a result of ongoing efforts to develop our drug candidates, including conducting ongoing research and development, preclinical studies and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Our net losses were $60.7 million and $93.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $400.0 million, and we do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing capital resources will fund our planned operating expenses into the first quarter of 2023 which is expected to fund key clinical data readouts for UBX1325, but less than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. We expect our operating losses and net cash used in operating activities will increase over at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities, advance our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical testing and move into later and more costly stages of drug development, hire personnel and prepare for regulatory submissions and the commercialization of our drug candidates. As a result, we will need to raise additional capital. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainty and potential for local and/or global economic recession. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we could be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.
We have historically financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and promissory notes, as well as public equity issuances, such as our initial public offering, or IPO, and more recently through proceeds from our Loan Agreement, the Initial ATM Offering Program, the Additional ATM Offering Program, the Equity Purchase Agreement and will continue to be dependent upon equity and/or debt financing to operate our business until we are able to generate positive cash flows from our operations.
In August 2020, we entered into a Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”) pursuant to a term loan, subject to certain terms and conditions and $25.0 million dollars was advanced to us on the date of execution of the Loan Agreement. The milestones for the remaining tranches have not yet been reached and, as of December 31, 2021 will not be reached. We will make interest only payments through September 1, 2022 and will then repay the principal balance and interest in equal monthly installments through August 1, 2024. In December 2021, we entered into an amendment to our Loan and Security Agreement under the terms of which, Hercules (including any of its assignees) has the option for a period of six (6) months to convert up to $5.0 million of the outstanding principal under the existing loan into shares of our common stock. Under the Loan Amendment, the required cash reserve amount shall be reduced by the principal amount of the converted loan to not less than $10 million. As of December 31, 2021, we issued 1,727,361 shares of our common stock reducing our outstanding loan principal balance by $2.3 million. As of February 14, 2022, the remaining $2.7 million of debt principal was converted to equity, and reducing the required cash reserve to $10 million. In addition, the interest only period may extend by up to a maximum of 9 months to June 1, 2023 should we meet specific milestones related to our clinical trials and raising additional capital.
In June 2019, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, or the Shelf Registration Statement, covering the offering of up to $250.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The Shelf Registration Statement included an initial prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $75.0 million of our common stock from time to time through an at-the-market offering, or the Initial ATM Offering Program, under which Cowen acts as sales agent. In July 2020, we filed an additional prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement, covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to an additional $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time through an additional at-the-market offering, or the Additional ATM Offering Program, under which Cowen acts as sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold 1,187,068 shares of common stock sold through the Initial ATM Offering Program and 707,459 shares of common stock sold through the Additional ATM Offering Program and received total net proceeds of approximately $10.4 million, after deducting commissions and other offering expenses of $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, no proceeds remained available to be sold under our Initial ATM Offering Program and approximately $48.2 million of Additional ATM Offering Program proceeds remained available to be sold under our Additional ATM Offering Program.
In September 2021, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, under which we may at our discretion, sell up to $30.0 million shares of our common stock over a 36-month period, subject to certain daily limits, applicable prices, and conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we had initiated the purchase of 3.9 million shares of our common stock amounting to $8.3 million in gross proceeds. In addition, under the Purchase Agreement, we issued 252,447 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement.
Future Funding Requirements
To date we have not generated any revenue from contracts with customers. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new drug candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Moreover, since becoming a public company, we continue to incur additional ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.
Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our drug candidates or from collaborative agreements with third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through various means. Other than our right to cause Lincoln Park to purchase shares of our common stock under the LPC Purchase Agreement, which is subject to certain limitations and conditions, we do not have any committed external source of funds. Additional capital may be raised through the sale of our equity securities, incurring debt, entering into licensing or collaboration agreements with partners, receiving research contributions, grants or other sources of
financing to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us on attractive terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our rate of spending through reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back, or stopping certain research and development programs. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to drug candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose.
Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing capital resources will fund our planned operating expenses into the first quarter of 2023 which is expected to fund key clinical data readouts for UBX1325. We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development, and commercialization of biotechnology products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the results of our ongoing clinical trials of UBX1325;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our drug candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical studies;
•
potential delays in or an increase in costs associated with our ongoing or planned preclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates;
•
the number and characteristics of any additional drug candidates we develop or acquire;
•
the timing and amount of any milestone payments we are required to make pursuant to our license agreements;
•
the cost of manufacturing our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;
•
the expenses needed to attract, hire, and retain skilled personnel;
•
the cost of commercialization activities if our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;
•
our ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty or other payments due under any such agreement;
•
any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;
•
the costs associated with being a public company;
•
the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio; and
•
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of any future approved products, if any.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
Our contractual obligations and commitments relate primarily to our Loan Agreement, operating leases and non-cancelable purchase obligations under agreements with various research and development organizations and suppliers in the ordinary course of business. In February 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for new office and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California. See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 8, “Term Loan Facility,” to our financial statements for further information.
We are party to various license agreements pursuant to which we have in-licensed rights to various technologies, including patents, research “know-how” and proprietary research tools, for the discovery, research, development and commercialization of drug candidates to treat age-related diseases. The license agreements obligate us to make certain milestone payments related to specified clinical development and sales milestone events, as well as tiered royalties in the low-single digits based on sales of licensed products. See Note 5 to our financial statements “License Revenue, Agreements and Strategic Investment” for additional information.
Indemnification
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future but have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations.
In accordance with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, we have potential indemnification obligations to our officers and directors for specified events or occurrences, subject to some limits, while they are
serving at our request in such capacities. There have been no claims to date, and we have director and officer insurance that may enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid for future potential claims.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Research and Development Expenses and Accruals
Costs related to research and development of drug candidates are charged to research and development expense as incurred. Research and development costs include, but are not limited to, payroll and personnel expenses for personnel contributing to research and development activities, laboratory supplies, outside services, licenses acquired to be used in research and development, manufacturing of clinical material, pre-clinical testing and consultants and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment, depreciation and utilities. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred unless there is an alternative future use in other research and development projects. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in which the related goods are received or services are rendered. Such payments are evaluated for current or long-term classification based on when they will be realized.
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the production of clinical trial materials or based on progression of the clinical trial, as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates by taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of consummation of goods and services, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent in part upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations, contract manufacturers and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. Adjustments to prior period estimates have not been material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
We have and may continue to enter into license agreements to access and utilize certain technology. We evaluate if the license agreement is an acquisition of an asset or a business. To date none of our license agreements have been considered to be an acquisition of a business. For asset acquisitions, the upfront payments to acquire such licenses, as well as any future milestone payments made before product approval, are immediately recognized as research and development expense when due, provided there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects. These license agreements may also include contingent consideration in the form of cash and additional issuances of our common stock.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation costs related to stock-based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, and we recognize forfeitures as they occur. For awards that vest solely based on service conditions or a combination of service and performance conditions, we estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is typically their vesting period. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
The market traded price of the shares of common stock underlying the stock-based awards is the fair value of our stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:
•
Expected term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We use, due to insufficient historical data, the simplified method to determine the expected term, which is based on the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
•
Expected volatility-Due to our limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded entities over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their size, stage in the product development cycle or area of specialty. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
•
Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards.
•
Expected dividend-We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
We have also granted stock options to certain key employees that vest in conjunction with certain market conditions. The Company uses the Monte-Carlo option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards that contain only market conditions. The Monte-Carlo option pricing model uses similar input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however, it further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $23.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted-average period of 3.2 years. For stock-based awards subject to ratable vesting, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award. In future periods, our stock-based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional stock-based awards to attract and retain our employees.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We also rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including, without limitation, providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO, (2) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company” which may allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
