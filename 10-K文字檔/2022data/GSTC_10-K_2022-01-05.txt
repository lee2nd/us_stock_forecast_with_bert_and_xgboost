This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including information about possible or assumed results of our financial conditions, operations, plans, objectives, and performance that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.

The words expect, anticipate, estimate or similar expressions are also used to indicate forward-looking statements.
Plan of Operations
We believe we do not have adequate funds to fully execute our business plan for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional funding. However, should we not raise this capital, we will allocate our funding to first assure that all State, Federal and SEC requirements are met.
Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $0 compared to revenue of $77 during the year ended September 30, 2020.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $2,412 during the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $37,682 during the prior year. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to the write down of slow-moving and expired inventory during the current year of $2,412.
Sales, General, and Administrative Expenses
We incurred sales, general and administrative expenses of $9,091,817 during the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $266,066 during the year ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $8,825,751 or approximately 3,317%. The increase was due primarily to an increase in non-cash compensation of $8,095,497, an increase in officer salaries of $166,500, an increase in marketing costs of $119,000 and an increase in legal fees of $66,655.
Loss on Settlement of Liabilities
We recognized a loss on settlement of liabilities in the amount of $419,900 during the year ended September 30, 2021 with no such gain during the year ended September 30, 2020. The loss was related to settling accrued compensation with our former CEO.

Interest Expense
We recognized interest expense in the amount of $287,499 for the year ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $49,439 or approximately 21% compared to $238,060 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was due primarily to additional convertible debt instruments issued during the year and the amortization of discount associated with those notes payable.
Net Loss
For the reasons above, our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $9,801,628 an increase of $9,259,897 or approximately 1710% compared to a net loss of $541,731 for the year ended September 30, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 30, 2021, we had cash of $5,960 and a working capital deficit in the amount of $725,821. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we had cash used in operating activities of $751,232, consisting of our net loss of $9,801,628, partially offset by non-cash compensation of $8,130,997, loss on settlement of liabilities of $419,900, depreciation of $1,275, and amortization of discount on notes payable of $274,803. Our cash position also increased by a net change in the components of working capital in the amount of $725,821 during the period. We have an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2021 in the amount of $17,016,966. We generated cash flows from financing activities in the amount of $95,000 from the issuance of convertible notes payable and $580,750 from the sale of common stock.
We had no material commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases as of September 30, 2021. However, should we execute our business plan as anticipated, we will incur substantial capital expenditures and require financing in addition to what is required to fund our present operation.
We intend to pursue capital through public or private financing, as well as borrowing and other sources in order to finance our business activities. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then our ability to continue our operations may be significantly hindered.
Additional Financing
Additional financing is required to continue operations. Although actively searching for available capital, the Company does not have any current arrangements for additional outside sources of financing and cannot provide any assurance that such financing will be available.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared; actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the critical accounting policies, which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements.
Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Going concern - The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company had a net loss of $9,801,628 and generated negative cash flow from operating activities in the amount of $751,232. In view of these matters, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, which is dependent upon its ability to achieve a level of profitability or to obtain additional capital to finance its operations. The Company intends on financing its future activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
