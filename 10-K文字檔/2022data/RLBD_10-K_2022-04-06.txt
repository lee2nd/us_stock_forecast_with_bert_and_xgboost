Overview
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include Real Brands, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. One subsidiary, Real Brands Venture Group, LLC, has been inactive for the last two years and only maintains a debt instrument on its financial records. DePetrillo Real Estate Holdings, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of CASH Acquisition Corp. and the owner of the Company’s building in Rhode Island. American Standard Hemp Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of CASH Acquisition Corp. and holds the hemp licenses in Rhode Island. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Key areas of estimation include the estimated useful lives of property, plant, equipment and intangibles assets and liabilities, income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates. Accounting standard updates
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the effect of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates as one segment, in which management uses one measure of profitability, and all of the Company’s assets are located in the United States of America. The Company does not operate separate lines of business or separate business entities with respect to any of its product candidates. Accordingly, the Company does not have separately reportable segments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be a cash equivalent.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and generally does not require collateral. The Company reviews all outstanding accounts receivable for collectability on a quarterly basis. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for any amounts deemed uncollectable. The Company does not accrue interest receivable on past due accounts receivable.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company, from time to time during the years covered by these consolidated financial statements, may have bank balances in excess of its insured limits. Management has deemed this a normal business risk.
Inventory
Inventory is comprised of raw hemp and hemp oil in different phases of production to completion of final product. Products include tinctures, creams and lotions. Inventory is valued at cost. No packaging material of any kind is included in inventory. Packaging materials are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment
On February 15, 2020 the Company purchased DePetrillo Real Estate Holdings, LLC, a Rhode Island Limited Liability Company having as it’s only asset the building at 12 Humbert Street in North Providence Rhode Island. The building is the Company’s headquarters and a hemp processing facility. The purchase price of the building was 2 million shares of CASH common stock, $25,000 in cash and the assumption of the mortgage which at the time was $189,916. The prior owner agreed to put the $25,000 payment into building improvements. The building and land were appraised at $475,000. The building is being depreciated over 15 years on a straight-line basis starting October 1, 2021. Depreciation expense on the building for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $7,917.
The Company made $121,411 in building improvements and purchases of $26,588 in furniture and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company made $644,412 in building improvements during the year ended December 31, 2020. $135,000 of those improvements were in the form of CASH common stock valued at $0.50 per share. Building improvements is being depreciated over 15 years commencing from the completion of the work, October 1, 2021. Depreciation expense on building improvements for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $13,097.
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five years. On December 31, 2021 the Company wrote down the value of the equipment to $0 because the equipment had been sitting idle for over a year resulting in a loss on disposal of assets of $385,989. The furniture and equipment and related accumulated depreciation were removed from the books as of December 31, 2021. Depreciation expense on the property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2021, before it was written off was $146,522. Total depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $167,536. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value on the books of the Company.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows, ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which establishes a single and comprehensive framework and sets out how much revenue is to be recognized, and when. The core principle is that a vendor should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the vendor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue will now be recognized by a vendor when control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In contrast, Revenue based revenue recognition is around an analysis of the transfer of risks and rewards; this now forms one of a number of criteria that are assessed in determining whether control has been transferred. The application of the core principle in ASC 606 is carried out in five steps: Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer: a contract is defined as an agreement (including oral and implied), between two or more parties, that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for each of those rights and obligations. The contract needs to have commercial substance and it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: a performance obligation in a contract is a promise (including implicit) to transfer a good or service to the customer. Each performance obligation should be capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable in the contract. Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: transaction price is the amount of consideration that the entity can be entitled to, in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: for a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the entity will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation separately, in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The acceptable methods of allocating the transaction price include adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and the residual approach in limited circumstances. Discounts given should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless certain criteria are met and reallocation of changes in standalone selling prices after inception is not permitted. Step 5 - Recognize revenue as and when the entity satisfies a performance obligation: the entity should recognize revenue at a point in time, except if it meets any of the three criteria, which will require recognition of revenue over time: the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset controlled by the customer, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the entity’s performance as the entity performs, and the entity does not create an asset that has an alternative use to the entity and the entity has the right to be paid for performance to date.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and consultants based on the fair value at grant date, which generally is the agreement date the Company entered into with employees or consultants. To date the Company has issued restricted common stock shares and preferred stock.
Beneficial Conversion Features of Convertible Securities
Conversion options that are not bifurcated as a derivative pursuant to ASC 815 and not accounted for as a separate equity component under the cash conversion guidance are evaluated to determine whether they are beneficial to the investor at inception (a beneficial conversion feature) or may become beneficial in the future due to potential adjustments. The beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt which are outside the scope of ASC 815. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion option’s in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as a dividend over either the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the dividend must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.
Derivatives
The Company reviews the terms of convertible debt issued to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.
Bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common stock equivalents are determined using the treasury stock method. For diluted net loss per share purposes, the Company excludes stock options and other stock-based awards, including shares issued as a result of option exercises that are subject to repurchase by the Company, whose effect would be anti-dilutive from the calculation. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share, as their effect was anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share was the same in all periods presented.
The Company had 154,518,887 and 28,443,298 potentially dilutive options and convertible securities that have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021, and 223,237,026 and 26,694,516 potentially dilutive options and convertible securities that have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020, as they would be anti-dilutive.
Treasury Stock
The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholder’s deficit.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The guidance for fair value measurements, ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes the authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and outlines the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs as follow:
• Level 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2 - Inputs, other than level 1 inputs, either directly or indirectly observable; and
• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using internal estimates and assumptions (there is little or no market date) which reflect those that market participants would use.
The Company records its derivative activities at fair value. As of December 31, 2021, no derivative liabilities are recorded.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to unrecognized income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation for employees and directors in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation (“ASC 718”) as issued by the FASB. ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company’s common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method. In accordance with ASC 718 and, excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock-based awards are classified as cash flows from operating activities. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” Topic 842, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 840, Leases. The new standard increases transparency and comparability most significantly by requiring the recognition by lessees of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases longer than 12 months. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For lessees, leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company adopted the new lease guidance effective January 1, 2019. The Company is not a party to any leases and therefore is not showing any asset or liability related to leases in the current period or prior periods.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
Subsequent Events
On January 20, 2022 the Company entered into a purchase agreement with the former CEO of Real Brands Inc. Jerome Pearring. The Company sold certain intellectual property rights and Real Brands Venture Group a wholly owned subsidiary with the assumption of certain liabilities related to the IP. The purchase price is the assignment of 1,000,000 shares of series A preferred stock and waiver of any possible severance payments.
General
The Company’s primary business is hemp CBD oil/isolate extraction, wholesaling of CBD oils and isolate, and production and sales of hemp-derived CBD consumer brands. The Company’s brand development strategy will be to leverage existing Company resources into creating online sales, licensing opportunities and a distribution network for proprietary legal hemp.
Components of Statements of Operations
Revenue
Product revenue consists of sales of CBD oils, tinctures and creams under our own brand name and white labeled along with wholesale sale of isolate and distillate oils net of returns, discounts and allowances. Once a purchase order is received, the order is packaged and shipped to the customer. Depending on the customer, some orders are paid at the time of purchase and others have 30 day terms. We recognize the revenue when the order is delivered and received by the customer.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold represents costs of raw material, packaging, printing and labels, prepackaged goods for sale and the write down of any non-moving components of inventory.
We expect our cost of goods sold per unit to decrease as we scale our operations, improve product designs and work with our third-party suppliers to lower costs.
Operating Expenses
General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits, travel and other costs for employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, accounting services, repairs and maintenance, utilities for our building and information technology. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we grow our business and add additional employees.
Professional Fees
Professional fees consist of legal fees and audit fees.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest from notes due to debtholders and interest on the mortgage.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have had limited operations during 2021 due to renovations being conducted to our building and hemp processing facility at 12 Humbert St., in North Providence, RI. We were able to issue equity to finance the renovations and purchase additional equipment. We continue to pursue additional sources of capital though we have no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, additional financing at this time and there can be no assurance that any such financing will become available. We will need to raise additional capital in order to execute on our business plan. We intend on raising additional capital in the short term by selling equity through private placements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020
Revenue was $5,546 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $24,582 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company spent 2021 renovating the new facility in North Providence RI and did not concentrate on generating revenue during the year. We still need to raise a sufficient amount of capital to provide the resources required that would enable us to execute our business plan.
Cost of goods sold increased by $240,080 from $22,540 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $262,620 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is attributable the Company writing off the value of the inventory due to lack of movement of the inventory for over one year and due to the pandemic and renovations on the new facility.
General and administrative (G & A) expenses increased by $211,983 from $259,511 to $471,494 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is due to an increase in activity around the renovation and build out of the new facility and the raising of funds in order to facilitate that process, which once completed will not be ongoing.
Professional fees expenses decreased by $154,970 from $349,525 to $194,556 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is due to additional professional fees related to the merger and the requirement for two audits in the prior year, one for each of the merged Companies.
Payroll and related expenses decreased by $23,007 to $326,424 from $349,431 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is due to a reduction in hours for the production related employees because of the renovations being done to the building.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an option expense of $1,065,390, representing the amortization of the value of the options issued in 2020 that have not yet vested.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an option expense of $3,825,479, representing the amortization of the value of the options issued in 2020 and 2019 that have not yet vested.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a forgiveness of PPP debt of $143,485.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had interest expense of $33,040. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had interest expense of $31,183.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of a assets of $385,989. The Company wrote down the value of the equipment due to there being no use of the equipment for an extended period of time related to the pandemic and renovations to the new facility.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a warrant expense of $37,753 for warrants issued to extend the term of the convertible debt.
As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $2,795,771 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $6,272,910 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of a $197,255 as compared to $247,892 as of December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of $50,637. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,103,739 as compared to a working capital deficit of $636,179 as of December 31, 2020, representing an increase in the deficit of $467,560.
The Company is seeking additional capital in the private and/or public equity markets to continue operations and build sales, marketing, brand and distribution. The Company is currently evaluating additional equity and debt financing opportunities and may execute them when appropriate. However, there can be no assurances that the Company can consummate such a transaction or consummate a transaction at favorable prices.
Company plans on increased sales of its products in the market. However, there can be no assurances that the sales will increase or that even if they do increase that it will increase sufficiently to generate the necessary cash.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Real Brands, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Real Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, cash flows and the related notes to consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and Generally Accepted Audit Standards (GAAS). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, recurring losses, and expects continuing future losses, These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Long-lived asset valuation
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes projections of future cash flows to determine if there are indications of impairment of long-lived assets, specifically, land, buildings and equipment which totaled over $2 million as of December 31, 2021.
The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in future cash flows and changes in expected useful life which relates to the Company’s ability and intent to hold its asset groups for a period of time that recovers their carrying value.
We identified the valuation of certain long-lived assets to be a critical audit matter. The valuation is based upon undiscounted future cash flows related to certain long-lived assets, specifically, land, buildings, and equipment. Whereas auditor judgments were required to evaluate subjective assumptions in the Company’s analysis of undiscounted cash flows. These included estimated future revenue and operating expenses. Adverse changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an indicator of impairment has been identified and could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:
· We obtained an understanding for the Company’s process for determining indicators of impairment of long-lived assets and the Company’s evaluation of impairment when indicators arose.
· We visited the site of the long-lived assets located that were considered high risk for potential impairment.
· We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenues, operating results and cash flows by performing an independent sensitivity analysis related to the key inputs to forecasted cash flows.
The firm has served this client since December 2018.

REAL BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION, BACKGROUND, AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Real Brands, Inc. (“Real Brands” or the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on November 6, 1992. The Company was formed under the name Mercury Software. From 1997 to 2005 the Company changed its name several times. On October 10, 2005, the Company changed its name to Global Beverage Solutions, Inc. and began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol GBVS.OB.
On October 22, 2013, the Company changed its name to Real Brands, Inc. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved Real Brands’ corporate actions regarding its name change and its new stock symbol request and approved Real Brands’ 150:1 Reverse Stock Split. The new symbol was designated as GBVSD. On November 19, 2013, the ticker symbol changed to RLBD.
On October 22, 2020, the majority of the shareholders of the Company, by written consent, agreed to a “reverse triangular” merger with CASH Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of the merger, and Canadian American Standard Hemp Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CASH”), whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of CASH and merged it with and into CASH Acquisition Corp. Real Brands’ name and trading symbol were maintained, with CASH shareholders acquiring majority control of Real Brands.
The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby CASH was considered the accounting acquirer and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger”, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger has been replaced with the historical financial statements of CASH prior to the reverse merger. The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders’ equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to build its sales, brand, marketing and distribution and fund ongoing operating expenses is uncertain. The ability of the Company to generate sales revenue to offset the expenses and obtain profitability is uncertain. The Company had a net loss as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, of $2,795,771 and $6,272,910, respectively. These material uncertainties cast doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In the event the Company’s revenues do not significantly increase, the Company will require additional financing from time to time, which it intends to obtain through the issuance of common shares, debt, bonds, grants and other financial instruments. While the Company has been successful in raising funds through the issuance of common shares and obtaining debt in the past, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and while the Company believes that its revenues will increase it does not currently expect them to generate sufficient cash in the immediate future.

• The Company is seeking additional capital in the private and/or public equity markets to continue operations and build sales, marketing, brand and distribution. The Company is currently evaluating additional equity and debt financing opportunities and may execute them when appropriate. However, there can be no assurances that the Company can consummate such a transaction or consummate a transaction at favorable pricing.
• The Company plans on increased sales of its products in the market. However, there can be no assurances that the sales will increase or that even if they do increase that it will increase sufficiently to generate the necessary cash.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include Real Brands, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. One subsidiary, Real Brands Venture Group, LLC, has been inactive for the last two years and only maintains a debt instrument on its financial records. DePetrillo Real Estate Holdings, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of CASH Acquisition Corp. and the owner of the Company’s building in Rhode Island. American Standard Hemp Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of CASH Acquisition Corp. and holds the hemp licenses in Rhode Island. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Key areas of estimation include the estimated useful lives of property, plant, equipment and intangibles assets and liabilities, income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates.
Accounting standard updates
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the effect of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Contents
Segment Reporting
The Company operates as one segment, in which management uses one measure of profitability, and all of the Company’s assets are located in the United States of America. The Company does not operate separate lines of business or separate business entities with respect to any of its product candidates. Accordingly, the Company does not have separately reportable segments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be a cash equivalent.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and generally does not require collateral. The Company reviews all outstanding accounts receivable for collectability on a quarterly basis. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for any amounts deemed uncollectable. The Company does not accrue interest receivable on past due accounts receivable.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company, from time to time during the years covered by these consolidated financial statements, may have bank balances in excess of its insured limits. Management has deemed this a normal business risk.
Inventory
Inventory is comprised of raw hemp and hemp oil in different phases of production to completion of final product. Products include tinctures, creams and lotions. Inventory is valued at cost. No packaging material of any kind is included in inventory. Packaging materials are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment
On February 15, 2020 the Company purchased DePetrillo Real Estate Holdings, LLC, a Rhode Island Limited Liability Company having as it’s only asset the building at 12 Humbert Street in North Providence Rhode Island. The building is the Company’s headquarters and a hemp processing facility. The purchase price of the building was 2 million shares of CASH common stock, $25,000 in cash and the assumption of the mortgage which at the time was $189,916. The prior owner agreed to put the $25,000 payment into building improvements. The building and land were appraised at $475,000. The building is being depreciated over 15 years on a straight-line basis starting October 1, 2021, the date building improvements were completed. Depreciation expense on the building for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $7,917.
The Company made $121,411 in building improvements and purchases of $26,588 in furniture and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company made $644,412 in building improvements during the year ended December 31, 2020. $135,000 of those improvements were in the form of CASH common stock valued at $0.50 per share. Building improvements is being depreciated over 15 years commencing from the completion of the work, October 1, 2021. Depreciation expense on building improvements for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $13,097.
Contents
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five years. On December 31, 2021 the Company wrote down the value of the equipment to $0 because the equipment had been sitting idle for over a year resulting in a loss on disposal of assets of $385,989. The furniture and equipment and related accumulated depreciation were removed from the books as of December 31, 2021. Depreciation expense on the property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2021, before it was written off was $146,522. Total depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $167,536. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value on the books of the Company.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows, ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which establishes a single and comprehensive framework and sets out how much revenue is to be recognized, and when. The core principle is that a vendor should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the vendor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue will now be recognized by a vendor when control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In contrast, Revenue based revenue recognition is around an analysis of the transfer of risks and rewards; this now forms one of a number of criteria that are assessed in determining whether control has been transferred. The application of the core principle in ASC 606 is carried out in five steps: Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer: a contract is defined as an agreement (including oral and implied), between two or more parties, that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for each of those rights and obligations. The contract needs to have commercial substance and it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: a performance obligation in a contract is a promise (including implicit) to transfer a good or service to the customer. Each performance obligation should be capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable in the contract. Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: transaction price is the amount of consideration that the entity can be entitled to, in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: for a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the entity will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation separately, in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The acceptable methods of allocating the transaction price include adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and the residual approach in limited circumstances. Discounts given should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless certain criteria are met and reallocation of changes in standalone selling prices after inception is not permitted. Step 5 - Recognize revenue as and when the entity satisfies a performance obligation: the entity should recognize revenue at a point in time, except if it meets any of the three criteria, which will require recognition of revenue over time: the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset controlled by the customer, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the entity’s performance as the entity performs, and the entity does not create an asset that has an alternative use to the entity and the entity has the right to be paid for performance to date.

Stock-based Compensation
The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and consultants based on the fair value at grant date, which generally is the agreement date the Company entered into with employees or consultants. To date the Company has issued restricted common stock shares and preferred stock.
Beneficial Conversion Features of Convertible Securities
Conversion options that are not bifurcated as a derivative pursuant to ASC 815 and not accounted for as a separate equity component under the cash conversion guidance are evaluated to determine whether they are beneficial to the investor at inception (a beneficial conversion feature) or may become beneficial in the future due to potential adjustments. The beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt which are outside the scope of ASC 815. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion option’s in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as a dividend over either the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the dividend must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.
Derivatives
The Company reviews the terms of convertible debt issued to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.
Bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common stock equivalents are determined using the treasury stock method. For diluted net loss per share purposes, the Company excludes stock options and other stock-based awards, including shares issued as a result of option exercises that are subject to repurchase by the Company, whose effect would be anti-dilutive from the calculation. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share, as their effect was anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share was the same in all periods presented.
Contents
The Company had 154,518,887 and 28,443,298 potentially dilutive options and convertible securities, respectively, that have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021, and 223,237,026 and 26,694,516 potentially dilutive options and convertible securities, respectively, that have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020, as they would be anti-dilutive.
Treasury Stock
The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholder’s deficit.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The guidance for fair value measurements, ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes the authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and outlines the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs as follow:
• Level 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2 - Inputs, other than level 1 inputs, either directly or indirectly observable; and
• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using internal estimates and assumptions (there is little or no market date) which reflect those that market participants would use.
The Company records its derivative activities at fair value. As of December 31, 2021, no derivative liabilities are recorded.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to unrecognized income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation for employees and directors in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation (“ASC 718”) as issued by the FASB. ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company’s common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method. In accordance with ASC 718 and, excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock-based awards are classified as cash flows from operating activities. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” Topic 842, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 840, Leases. The new standard increases transparency and comparability most significantly by requiring the recognition by lessees of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases longer than 12 months. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For lessees, leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company adopted the new lease guidance effective January 1, 2019. The Company is not a party to any leases and therefore is not showing any asset or liability related to leases in the current period or prior periods.
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). The amendments within the update require certain disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The amendments will require disclosure of information about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions, information regarding the line items within the consolidated financial statements that are affected by the transactions, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The amendments in the update will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results of options.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
Subsequent Events
On January 20, 2022 the Company entered into a purchase agreement with the former CEO of Real Brands Inc., Jerome Pearring. The Company sold certain intellectual property rights and Real Brands Venture Group a wholly owned subsidiary with the assumption of certain liabilities related to the IP. The purchase price is the assignment of 1,000,000 shares of series A preferred stock and waiver of any possible severance payments.

NOTE 16 - INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $5,246,800 that expire in various years through the year 2041.
Due to net operating loss carry forwards and operating losses, there is no provision for current federal or state income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for federal and state income tax purposes.
The Company’s deferred tax asset at December 31, 2021 consists of net operating loss carry forwards calculated using federal and state effective tax rates equating to approximately $1,364,168 less a valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $1,364,168. Because of the Company’s lack of earnings history, the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $287,504 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and increased by approximately $253,355 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company’s total deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:
Total Deferred Tax
The reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal and state statutory income tax rate to total income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
Reconciliation of Income Taxes
Contents
On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax asset and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.
NOTE 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The purchase price is the assignment of 1,000,000 shares of series A preferred stock and waiver of any possible severance payments.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Furthermore, smaller reporting companies may face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies often employ fewer individuals and find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Often, one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company’s operation and are in a position to override any system of internal control. Additionally, smaller reporting companies may utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Subject to the inherent limitations described in the following paragraph, our management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2021 at the reasonable assurance level.
Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2021, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The employment agreement runs for three years and provides for an annual salary of $175,000 plus bonuses as determined by the Board of Directors.

The following table sets forth as of March 25, 2022, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock by (i) each Director, nominee and executive officer of us; (ii) each person who owns beneficially more than 5% of the common stock; and (iii) all Directors, nominees and executive officers as a group. The percentage of shares beneficially owned is based on there having been 2,677,529,115 shares of common stock outstanding as of such date.
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND BENEFICIAL OWNERS, AS OF MARCH 25, 2022
(1) Unless stated otherwise, the business address for each person named is Real Brands Inc., 12 Humbert St., North Providence, RI 02911.
(2) Calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that each individual or entity named has sole investment and voting power with respect to the shares of common stock indicated as beneficially owned by them (subject to community property laws where applicable) and except where otherwise noted.
(3) Includes 46,077,210 currently exercisable stock options.
(4) Includes 6,143,628 stock options which are currently exercisable.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.
We are not currently subject to the requirements of any stock exchange or inter-dealer quotation system with respect to having a majority of “independent directors” although we believe that we meet that standard inasmuch as Messrs. Toberoff, Christos, Dobbins, Engel and Granoff are “independent” and only Mr. Kidrin, by virtue of being our president and CEO, is not independent. Although we are not currently subject to such rule, the independence of our directors meets the definition of such term as contained in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2).
The Company is committed to a convertible note payable related party in the amount of $200,000. The convertible note has a 7% annual interest rate and matures on October 15, 2023. Interest and principal are payable at maturity. The note can be converted at any time and either all or part of the amount due into equity at a price of $0.008139 per share. If converted into common stock, the related party would own 1% of Company based upon current number of shares outstanding. The related party holding the convertible note is Worlds Inc. Messrs. Kidrin, Toboroff and Christos are Directors of Worlds Inc. and Mr. Kidrin is the CEO and Mr. Ryan is the CFO of Worlds Inc.
The Company has incurred $31,500 in interest expense on the note through December 31, 2021.
A loan was provided by the CEO, Thom Kidrin, at an interest rate of 7%. The loan balance at December 31, 2021 was $133,605 with accrued interest of $16,525.
