Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the section captioned “Risk Factors” in Annual Report. The following should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.
Overview
We are a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on immunology, urology, neurology and orthopedics using adult stem cell treatments and interrelated regenerative technologies for the treatment of multiple indications. Our existing and pipeline of therapies and products include of the following:
Our subsidiary, Creative Medical Technologies, Inc. (“CMT”), was originally created to monetize U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797 and related intellectual property related to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”), which it acquired in February 2016. Subsequently, we have expanded our development and acquisition of intellectual property beyond urology to include therapeutic treatments utilizing “re-programmed” stem cells, and the treatment of neurologic disorders, lower back pain, type I diabetes, and heart, liver, kidney and other diseases using various types of stem cells through our ImmCelz, Inc., StemSpine, Inc. and AmnioStem LLC subsidiaries. However, neither ImmCelz Inc., StemSpine Inc. nor AmnioStem LLC have commenced commercial activities.
We currently conduct substantially all of our commercial operations through CMT, which markets and sells our CaverStem® and FemCelz® disposable kits utilized by physicians to perform autologous procedures that treat erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction, respectively. Our CaverStem® and FemCelz® kits are currently available through physicians at eight locations in the United States.
In addition to our CaverStem® and FemCelz® products, we are currently in the process of recruiting clinical sites for our StemSpine® Regenerative Stem Cell Procedure for the Treatment of Degenerative Disc Disease. Our StemSpine® treatment is an autologous procedure that utilizes a patient’s own stem cells to treat lower back pain.
In 2020, through our ImmCelz Inc. subsidiary, we began exploring the development of treatments that utilize a patient’s own extracted immune cells that are then “reprogrammed” by culturing them outside the patient’s body with optimized stem cells. The immune cells are then re-injected into the patient from whom they were extracted. We believe this process endows the immune cells with regenerative properties that may be suitable for the treatment of stroke victims, among other indications. In contrast to other stem cell-based approaches, the immune cells are significantly smaller in size than stem cells and are believed to more effectively penetrate areas of the damaged tissues and induce regeneration.
We are currently primarily focused on expanding the commercial sale and use of our CaverStem® and FemCelz® products by physicians in the United States and Europe, and commercializing our StemSpine® treatment for lower back pain. We also recently filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to treat stroke utilizing our ImmCelzTM technology. In the future, subject to the availability of capital, we will seek to further develop additional therapeutic products that utilize our proprietary intellectual property.
Results of Operations - For the Year Ended December 31, 2021, and for the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Gross Revenue. We generated $87,754 in gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison with $164,500 for the comparable period a year ago. The decrease of $76,746 or 46.7% is primarily due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, we were experiencing an upward trend in sales. However, starting in 2020 and continuing through 2021, most elective procedures were halted in the U.S. This resulted in a near cessation of Caverstem® and FemCelz® procedures in those time frames. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021 we field tested an alternative sales and marketing program for CaverStem® whereby we marketed directly to the patient, collected the procedure fees from the patient and paid the physicians for their services. While this effort resulted in an increase in the number of procedures and gross revenues per procedure, gross margins were greatly reduced. As a result, we have reverted to our model of contracting with physicians, who resell our kits and bill their patients directly.
Cost of Goods Sold. We generated $47,949 in cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison with $50,596 for the comparable period a year ago. The decrease of $2,647 or 5.2% was less than the related 46.7% decrease in revenues due to reduced gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2021 as described above.
Gross Profit/(Loss). We generated $39,805 in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison with $113,904 in gross profit for the comparable period a year ago. The decrease of $74,099 or 65.1% is due to the lower sales associated with the COVID-19 pandemic identified above, lower per-unit revenue from new physician promotions and lower fourth quarter margins from the temporary shift to a direct-to-patient model.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, totaled $2,964,490, in comparison with $1,161,947 for the comparable period a year ago. The increase of 1,802,543, or 155.1% is primarily due to a $707,116 expense accrual related to a vendor dispute, $493,299 in stock-based compensation, $180,936 in board member consulting services, $132,164 of increased marketing expenses tied to the direct-to-patient program, and $96,152 in director and officer insurance, which we did not carry in 2020.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 totaled $109,180 in comparison to $0 for the comparable period a year ago. The increase was due to laboratory research associated with providing a response to the FDA on the ImmCelzTM IND application.
Operating Loss. For the reasons stated above, our operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $3,125,949 in comparison with $1,114,835 for the comparable period a year ago.
Other Expense. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $22,337,717 in comparison with an expense of $35,210,395 for the comparable period a year ago. The increased income of $57,548,112, is primarily due to a decrease of $60,011,354 in the in the fair value of derivative liabilities, a $585,601 gain upon the extinguishment of convertible notes, offset by an increase of $3,048,843 in interest expense for the comparable period a year ago. We incurred interest expense calculated on our promissory notes. We recorded the amortization of various debt discounts associated with our promissory notes. The discounts are the result of a combination of on-issuance discounts and fees, warrants issued with promissory notes, and derivative liabilities which are recorded due to the variability of the notes conversion price. The derivative liabilities are re-measured as of each reporting date.
Net Loss. For the reasons stated above, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $19,211,768 in comparison with a loss of $36,325,230 for the comparable period a year ago.
Amortization Expense. We acquired a patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797) from CMH on February 2, 2016, in exchange for shares of our restricted common stock valued at $100,000. The patent expires in 2026 and we have elected to amortize the patent over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. On August 25, 2016, CMT entered into a License Agreement which grants it the exclusive right to all products derived from US Patent No. 7,569,385 for multipotent amniotic fetal stem cells. Under the terms of the license agreement, CMT paid an initial license fee within 30 days of entering into the agreement. The patent expires in 2026 and we have elected to amortize the patent over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. On May 17, 2017, CMT purchased U.S. Patent No. 9,598,673 covering use of various stem cells for treatment of lower back pain from CMH. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to pay CMH $100,000. The agreement was modified in November 2017 to waive payment of the initial license fee, modify the fee structure and add the ability to convert the outstanding payable balance into common shares. In November 2020, the Company announced the commercialization of the lower back procedure using a patient’s own cells (“autologous”). This milestone triggered a milestone payment due from the Company to CMH in the amount of $300,000, which was subsequently paid. The patent expires in 2027, and we have elected to amortize the patent over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. In December 2020, we entered into a Patent License Agreement with Jadi Cells, Inc. Execution of the contract triggered a milestone payment due from the Company to Jadi Cells, Inc. in the amount of $250,000, which was paid with shares of our common stock in February 2022.
Amortization expense of $92,084 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing the amortization of the ED, multipotent amniotic fetal stem cell and lower back pain patents and the Jadi Cell patent license agreement based upon the remaining life of the patents and license agreement. There was $66,792 of amortization expense recorded for the period ended December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had $10,723,870 of available cash and positive working capital of approximately $9,814,709. In comparison, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $98,000 of available cash and a working capital deficit of approximately $40,423,000.
On December 7, 2021, we sold an aggregate of 3,875,000 shares of our common stock, and accompanying warrants to purchase 3,875,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.13 per share, at a combined public offering price to the public of $4.13 per share of common stock and related Warrant, pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement we entered into Roth Capital Partners, LLC. We received gross proceeds of $16,003,750, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of seven percent (7%) of the gross proceeds and offering expenses. We used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to (i) redeem our Bridge Notes described below, in the aggregate outstanding amount of $5,146,176, and (ii) repurchase the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $195,000.
In addition to our 2021 public offering and smaller private convertible note and preferred stock financing transactions we completed in the last two years, in August 2021, we completed the sale of 15% Original Issue Discount Senior Notes ( “Bridge Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,456,176. In connection with the sale of the Bridge Notes, holders of shares of our preferred stock issued earlier in 2021 exchanged such preferred stock for additional Bridge Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $690,000. We also issued to the purchasers of our Bridge Notes five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 363,046 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $14.175 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustment in the event of future sales of equity by us below the then exercise price, stock dividends, stock splits and other specified events.
Net Cash used in Operating Activities. We used cash in our operating activities due to our losses from operations. Net cash used in operating activities was $2,215,782 for the year-ended ended December 30, 2021 in comparison to $434,556 for the comparable period a year ago, an increase of $1,781,226 or 410%. The increase in cash used in operations was primarily related to a $299,900 increase in payments made to CMH and a $100,669 decrease in accrued expenses.
Net Cash used in Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the purchase of licenses in comparison to $250,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Cash from Financing Activities. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $14,758,488 in net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in our December 2021 public offering, along with $4,784,790 from the issuance of convertible debt, preferred stock and short-term, non-convertible notes. We spent $6,925,032 on re-payment of notes, redemption of preferred stock, and payment of debt issuance and offering costs. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised $710,920 primarily through the issuance of convertible debt and repaid $17,000 of convertible notes. The $12,147,720 or 1,751% increase in cash flows from financing activities were primarily related to our December 2021 public offering.
We have continued to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our December 2021 public offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through at least March 2023. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in the future to support our ongoing operations and continue our clinical trials. We expect to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities from time to time for the foreseeable future to fund the development of our proposed products through clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will likely be subject to various factors, including our overall business performance and market conditions. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our ability to raise capital to fund future operational and development initiatives.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. There are certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include:
1.
an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
2.
an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
3.
an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
4.
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of the exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies required to adopt these new requirements.
