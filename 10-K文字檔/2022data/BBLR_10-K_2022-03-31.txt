Based upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We intend to fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements.
Subsequent to the year end, on March 4, 2022, we entered a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “GHS Securities Purchase Agreement”) with GHS Investments, LLC (“GHS”), whereby GHS agreed to purchase, in tranches, up to Seven Thousand Dollars ($700,000) of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for Seven Hundred (700) shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. The first tranche, promptly upon execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement, was for the purchase of Three Hundred (300) shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock for Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000). The remaining tranches of shares shall occur so long as certain conditions are met as described in the GHS Securities Purchase Agreement.
The Company issued to GHS commitment shares of Thirty Five (35) shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and a warrant (the “GHS Warrant”) to purchase 75% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “GHS Warrant Shares”). The Company has agreed to register the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and the GHS Warrant Shares.
We also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement on March 10, 2022 with another accredited investor, whereby the investor agreed to purchase One Hundred and Sixty (160) shares of Series C Preferred Stock for One Hundred and Sixty Thousand ($160,000).
The Company issued to this investor commitment shares of Eight (8) shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 75% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Warrant Shares”). The Company has agreed to register the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and the Warrant Shares.
Also on March 4, 2022, the Company entered into an Equity Financing Agreement (“Equity Financing Agreement”) and Registration Rights Agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”) with GHS. Under the terms of the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS agreed to provide the Company with up to Fifteen Million ($15,000,000) upon effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).
Following effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company shall have the discretion to deliver puts to GHS and GHS will be obligated to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) based on the investment amount specified in each put notice. The maximum amount that the Company shall be entitled to put to GHS in each put notice shall not exceed two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the average daily trading dollar volume of the Company’s Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days preceding the put, in an amount equaling less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or greater than one million dollars ($1,000,000). Pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS and its affiliates will not be permitted to purchase and the Company may not put shares of the Company’s Common Stock to GHS that would result in GHS’s beneficial ownership equaling more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock. The price of each put share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Market Price (as defined in the Equity Financing Agreement). Following an up-list to the NASDAQ or an equivalent national exchange by the Company, the Purchase price shall mean ninety percent (90%) of the Market Price, subject to a floor of $.01 per share. Puts may be delivered by the Company to GHS until the earlier of twenty-four (24) months after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the date on which GHS has purchased an aggregate of $15,000,000 worth of Common Stock under the terms of the Equity Financing Agreement.
Additionally, concurrently with the execution of definitive agreements, the Company shall issue common shares to the Investor representing a dollar value equal to one percent (1.0%) of the Commitment Amount (the “Commitment Shares”). The Commitment Shares shall be calculated at the applicable Purchase Price on the trading day immediately preceding the execution of definitive agreements.
The Registration Rights Agreement provides that the Company shall (i) use its best efforts to file with the Commission the Registration Statement within 30 days of the date of the Registration Rights Agreement; and (ii) have the Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission within 30 days after the date the Registration Statement is filed with the Commission, but in no event more than 90 days after the Registration Statement is filed.
On March 24, 2022, the Company and White Lion executed a Termination and Release Agreement dated March 22, 2022, to terminate the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement dated February 1, 2022 for an equity line of up to $10 million and registration rights. In consideration, the Company agreed to issue to White Lion 103,000 shares of common stock and to register all White Lion’s 206,000 shares.
We also plan to seek additional financing in a private or public equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
• Foreign Currency Translations
• Intangible Assets
• Long-lived Assets
• Income Taxes
Foreign Currency Translations
The functional currency of the Company’s international subsidiaries is generally their local currency of Great British pounds (GBP). Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average rates of exchange during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into accumulated other comprehensive income.
Intangible Assets
The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted future cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
