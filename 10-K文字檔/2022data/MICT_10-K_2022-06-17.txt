Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
As of June 23, 2020, we increased our ownership interest in Micronet to over 50% and started to consolidate Micronet’s operations into our financial statements up until May 9, 2021 when our ownership in Micronet was diluted to less than 50%. In addition, on July 1, 2020, we completed a merger transaction for the Acquisition of GFHI. We are consolidating the financial results of GFHI as of the date the Acquisition and for the period thereafter. Beginning December 2020, we launched our insurance platform operated by GFHI for the Chinese market and have been generating revenues in GFHI in this segment of our operations. During the first quarter of 2021, as described above, we entered into a certain transaction with Guangxi Zhongtong, Beijing Fucheng Lianbao Technology Co., Ltd. and completed the acquisition of Magpie, which operates in the field of securities trading platforms. As a result of these transactions, we have started to consolidate the financial results of these companies and business lines into our business. On July 1, 2021, we entered into a VIE transaction with All Weather and started to consolidate the financial results and business lines of All Weather into our business once the transaction was consummated. On October 21, 2021 we completed the transaction of Guangxi Zhongtong, we currently holds a sixty percent (60%) equity interest in Guangxi Zhongtong

Loans Provided by MICT
On November 13, 2019, the Company and Micronet executed a convertible loan agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to loan Micronet $500,000 (the “Convertible Loan”). The Convertible Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.95% calculated and paid on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Convertible Loan, if not converted, shall be repaid in four equal installments, the first of such installment payable following the fifth quarter after the issuance of the Convertible Loan, with the remaining three installments due on each subsequent quarter thereafter, such that the Convertible Loan shall be repaid in full upon the lapse of 24 months from its issuance. In addition, the outstanding principal balance of the Convertible Loan, and all accrued and unpaid interest, is convertible at the Company’s option, at a conversion price equal to 0.38 NIS per Micronet share. Pursuant to the Convertible Loan agreement, Micronet also agreed to issue the Company an option to purchase one of Micronet’s ordinary shares for each ordinary share that it issued as a result of a conversion of the Convertible Loan at an exercise price of 0.60 NIS per share, exercisable for a period of 15 months. On July 5, 2020, Micronet had a reverse split where the price of the Convertible Loan changed from 0.08 NIS per Micronet share into 5.7 NIS per Micronet share. The option’s exercise price changed from 0.6 NIS per share to 9 NIS per Micronet share.
On January 1, 2020, the Convertible Loan was approved at a general meeting of the Micronet shareholders and the Convertible Loan and the transactions contemplated thereby became effective. The loan was repaid on January 4, 2022.
On August 13, 2020, MICT Telematics extended to Micronet an additional loan in the aggregate amount of $175,000 (the “Third Loan”) which governed the existing outstanding intercompany debt. The Third Loan does not bear any interest and has a term of twelve (12) months. The Third Loan was extended for the purpose of supporting Micronet’s working capital and general corporate needs. The loan was repaid on August 25, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had short-term loans from others of $1,657 comprised as follows: $1,155 loans of All Weather Insurance Agency bear interest of 0%, of which $1,088 will be repaid on December 31, 2022 and $67 will be repaid on August 3, 2022.

Debt Repayment
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our total debt was $1,657,000 as compared to $884,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in total debt is primarily due to the dilution in our ownership and voting interests in Micronet, causing us to cease consolidating Micronet’s operations in our financial statements commencing from May 9, 2021 and a new loan that All weather received from others.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our working capital was $102,107,000, compared to $26,693,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to the increase in our cash as described above.

We expect the net proceeds from the sale of the securities will be used to fund the growth and development of our business, as well as for working capital and for other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our business, but we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.
Based on our current business plan, and in view of our cash balance following the transactions described in this Item 2, we anticipate that our cash balances will be sufficient to permit us to conduct our operations and carry out our contemplated business plans for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material to investors on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses and gains that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:
● Amortization of acquired intangible assets - We are required to amortize the intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to the Transaction and the Acquisition. The amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization are unique to these transactions. The amortization of acquired intangible assets are non-cash charges. We believe that such charges do not reflect our operational performance. Therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-transaction operating results.
● Expenses related to beneficial conversion feature expense - Those expenses are non-cash expenses and are related to the difference between the stock price at the closing of the Note Purchase Agreements and the conversion price of $1.10 per share.
● Stock-based compensation is share based awards granted to certain individuals. They are non-cash and affected by our historical stock prices which are irrelevant to forward-looking analyses and are not necessarily linked to our operational performance.
● Expenses related to the purchase of a business - These expenses relate directly to the purchase of the GFH I transaction and consist mainly of legal and accounting fees, insurance fees and other consultants. We believe that these expenses do not reflect our operational performance. Therefore, we exclude them to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-Vehicle Business purchase operating results.
● Expenses related to settlement agreement - These expenses relate directly to the settlement agreement with Maxim and Sunrise. More information can be found in the legal proceeding part.
The following table reconciles, for the periods presented, GAAP net loss attributable to MICT to non-GAAP net income attributable to MICT. and GAAP loss per diluted share attributable to MICT to non-GAAP net loss per diluted share attributable to MICT.:
