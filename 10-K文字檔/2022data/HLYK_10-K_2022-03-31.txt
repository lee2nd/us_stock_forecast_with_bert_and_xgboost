Overview
HealthLynked Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 4, 2014. We currently operate in four distinct divisions: the Health Services Division, the Digital Healthcare Division, the ACO/MSO (Accountable Care Organization / Managed Service Organization) Division, and the Medical Distribution Division. Our Health Services division is comprised of the operations of (i) Naples Women’s Center (“NWC”), a multi-specialty medical group including OB/GYN (both Obstetrics and Gynecology) and General Practice, (ii) Naples Center for Functional Medicine (“NCFM”), a Functional Medical Practice acquired in April 2019 that is engaged in improving the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care, and (iii) Bridging the Gap Physical Therapy (“BTG”), a physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, FL opened in January 2020 that provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery. Our Digital Healthcare division develops and operates an online personal medical information and record archive system, the “HealthLynked Network,” which enables patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system. Our ACO/MSO Division is comprised of the business acquired of Cura Health Management LLC (“CHM”) and its subsidiary ACO Health Partners LLC (“AHP”), which were acquired by the Company on May 18, 2020. CHM and AHP operate an Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) and Managed Service Organization (“MSO”) that assists physician practices in providing coordinated and more efficient care to patients via the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) as administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”), which rewards providers for efficiency in patient care. Our Medical Distribution Division is comprised of the operations of MedOffice Direct LLC (“MOD”), a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States we acquired on October 19, 2020.

Results of Operations: Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020:
Revenue
Patient service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $1,020,375, or 22% year-over-year, to $5,764,186, primarily as a result of increased patient service revenue at our NCFM practice of $704,578, increases at our NWC practice of $247,661, and increases at our BTG practice of $68,135.
Medicare shared savings revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $1,651,568, or 215%, to $2,419,312 year-over-year as a result of the higher $2,419,312 MSSP payment received in September 2021 compared to a payment of $767,744 received in September 2020.
Consulting and event revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $136,545, or 32% year-over-year to $296,432. Consulting revenue of $281,549 was earned by the ACO/MSO Division in 2021, compared to $432,977 in the year ended December 31, 2020, and decreased due to the discontinuation of a large consulting agreement in 2021. Event revenue of $14,883 was earned in connection with the HealthLynked Future of Healthcare Summit held in March 2021.
Product revenue was $718,062 in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to revenue of $188,588 included in our consolidated operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 529,474, or 281%. Product revenue was earned by the Medical Distribution Division, comprised of the operations acquired with MOD in October 2020. Accordingly, 2020 results include approximately only two-and-a-half months of product revenue from the acquisition date of October 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, whereas 2021 results include an entire year.
Operating Expenses and Costs
Practice salaries and benefits increased by $533,510, or 21%, to $3,114,991 in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of increased staffing at each of our service facilities relative to 2020 to meet an increase in patient visits in 2021 relative to 2020.
Other practice operating costs increased by $200,161, or 9%, to $2,349,279 in the year ended December 31, 2021, corresponding to increased patient service revenue at the NCFM, BTG and NWC practices.
Medicare shared savings expenses increased by $1,395,711, or 137% to $2,413,205 primarily as a result of the higher MSSP payment received in September 2021 of $2,419,312, as compared to a payment of $767,744 received in September 2020, resulting in higher payments to participating providers. Medicare shared savings expenses represent costs incurred to deliver Medicare shared savings revenue, including overhead and consulting fees related to advising participating physician practices, as well as the physicians’ portion of any shared savings received by the ACO.
Cost of product revenue was $606,521 in the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $460,060, or 314%, compared to the same period of 2020. Cost of product revenue relates to the cost of medical products sold by the Medical Distribution Division, which is comprised of the operations acquired with MOD in October 2020. Accordingly, 2020 results include approximately only two-and-a-half months of product cost from the acquisition date of October 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, whereas 2021 results include an entire year.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $1,866,639, or 61%, to $4,929,668 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to more personnel and overhead costs in our corporate function in connection with our continued expansion, increased stock-based consulting fees, higher legal, accounting and cash-based consulting fees, and higher advertising, promotional and development costs associated with developing and marketing the HealthLynked Network and related applications.
Depreciation and amortization increased the year ended December 31, 2021 by $580,330, or 235%, to $827,969 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the MOD acquisition.
Loss from operations increased by $1,971,539, or 64%, to $5,043,368 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased selling, general and administrative costs related to our expansion as well as amortization of intangibles from MOD, offset by increases in each of our revenue streams.
Other Income (Expenses)
Loss on sales of marketable securities decreased 100% to $-0- in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $282,107 in the year ended December 31, 2020. Such losses in 2020 arose from sales of marketable securities acquired in the August 2020 Equity Transaction at prices below the acquisition price.
Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $3,609,797, or 268%, to $4,957,168 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of a January 2021 transaction pursuant to which the holder of convertible notes with a face value of $1,038,500 and $317,096 of accrued interest agreed to convert the notes pursuant to the original note terms and agreed to a leak-out provision on the received shares in exchange for a five-year warrant to purchase 13,538,494 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share. In connection with the conversion, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $5,463,492 in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing the excess of the fair value of the shares and warrant issued at conversion over the carrying value of the host instrument and accrued interest. This loss was offset by a debt extinguishment gain of $632,826 related to the forgiveness of PPP loans in May and June 2021. Losses on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from an excess of fair value of consideration paid to retire a convertible notes over the carrying value of the instrument and related derivatives being retired.
Losses from the change in fair value of debt decreased by $362,589, or 95%, to $19,246 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $381,835 in the year ended December 31, 2020. Such losses resulted from certain convertible notes and notes payable to related parties that, in previous periods, were extended and treated as an extinguishment and reissuance for accounting purposes, requiring these notes to be subsequently carried at fair value. The change in fair value at the end of each reporting period was recorded as “Change in fair value of debt.” After conversion of our remaining convertible notes outstanding in January 2021, we had no further debt carried at fair value.
Amortization of original issue and debt discounts was $530,930 for the year ended December 31, 2020. With the retirement in 2020 of all floating rate convertible notes with discounts subject to amortization, there were no corresponding charges in the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gains from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments was $739,485 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We retired all derivative financial instruments in 2020 with the repayment of all adjustable-rate convertible notes payable that carried embedded conversion feature derivatives, so there were no corresponding gains or charges in the year ended December 31, 2021.
(Loss) gain from the change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration increased by $449,608, or 592%, to a loss of $373,656 in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $75,952 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the loss in 2021 was due primarily to the increase in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration related to our acquisition of MOD, which is payable in a fixed number of shares upon achievement of annual revenue milestones of the underlying business between 2021 and 2024. Due in large part to an increase in our stock price since December 31, 2020, the fair value of the liability increased substantially.
Interest expense decreased by $230,615, or 92%, to $19,144 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to interest expense of $249,759 in the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the repayment and conversion of convertible notes and notes payable to related parties during 2020 and forgiveness of PPP loans in 2021, leaving low-interest government loans as our only debt.
Total other expenses increased by $2,685,787, or 100%, to $5,369,214 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily as a result of a (i) $5,589,994 loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the retirement of our last remaining convertible notes payable in 2021, (ii) an increase in losses from the change in fair value of contingent acquisition due principally to the fixed-share structure of the MOD contingent consideration, and (iii) a gain in change in fair value of derivative financial instruments in 2020 with no corresponding income or charge in 2021.
Net loss increased by $4,657,326, or 81%, to $10,412,582 in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net loss of $5,755,256 in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of (i) a loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the retirement of our last remaining convertible notes payable in 2021, (ii) increased selling, general and administrative costs related to our expansion, an increase in losses from the change in fair value of contingent acquisition due to the fixed-share structure of the MOD contingent consideration, and (iii) a gain in change in fair value of derivative financial instruments in 2020 with no corresponding income or charge in 2021. The increased losses were offset by a 50% overall increase in our revenue year-over-year, a gain on debt extinguishment related to the forgiveness of PPP Loans in 2021, and the retirement of convertible debt that eliminated debt discount amortization charges incurred in prior periods.
Seasonal Nature of Operations
We acquired CHM in May 2020. CHM’s primary source of revenue is derived from payments earned under the Medicare shared savings program. Such amounts are determined annually when we are notified by CMS of the amount of shared savings earned. Accordingly, we recognize Medicare shared savings revenue in the period in which the CMS notifies us of the exact amount of shared savings to be paid, which historically has occurred during the three-month period ended September 30 for the program year ended December 31 of the previous year. Medicare shared savings revenue for the program year ended December 31, 2020, for which we received payment and recognized revenue in September 2021, was $2,419,312. Medicare shared savings revenue for the program year ended December 31, 2019, for which we received payment and recognized revenue in September 2020, was $767,744. Future recognition of Medicare shared savings revenue is expected to result in a material increase in our consolidated revenues in the third fiscal quarter of each year compared to the first, second and fourth fiscal quarters. Likewise, in the period in which we recognize Medicare shared savings revenue, we also determine the amount of shared savings expense to be paid to physicians participating in our ACO. This expense is also expected to be recognized in the third fiscal quarter of each year and is expected to materially increase our total operating expenses in the third fiscal quarter compared to other quarters of the fiscal year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Condition
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash balances of $3,291,646, working capital of $1,732,530 and accumulated deficit $32,205,189. For the year months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $10,412,582 and net cash used by operating activities of $3,769,854. Net cash used in investing activities was $341,356. Net cash provided by financing activities was $7,240,672, including $6,949,281 received from sales of common stock in private placements, registered direct transactions and puts pursuant to the now-expired July 2016 $3 million investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”), and $350,200 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants.
During January 2021, the holder of $1,038,500 fixed rate convertible debt converted the entire face value of $1,038,500, plus $317,096 of accrued interest on such notes, into 13,538,494 shares of common stock pursuant to the original conversion terms of the underlying notes. Following the conversion, we had no further convertible debt outstanding. During May 2021, PPP loans in the amount of $632,826 plus $6,503 accrued interest were forgiven. During August 2021, we sold 3,703,704 common shares and 1,851,852 five-year warrants with an exercise price of $0.65 to an institutional investor at an offering price of $0.54 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $2,000,000 and net proceeds after offering costs and expenses of $1,719,921.
We believe that we have sufficient cash on hand to fund the business for at least the next 12 months. We intend that the longer term (i.e., beyond twelve months) cost of completing additional intended acquisitions, implementing our development and sales efforts related to the HealthLynked Network and maintaining existing and expanding overhead and administrative costs will be financed from (i) cash on hand resulting from fund raising efforts in 2021, (ii) cash generated by our profitable Health Services and ACO/MSO business units, and (iii) the use of further outside funding sources. No assurances can be given that we will be able to access additional outside capital in a timely fashion. If necessary funds are not available, our business and operations would be materially adversely affected and in such event, we would attempt to reduce costs and adjust our business plan.
COVID-19
A novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, that was first identified in China in December 2019, has surfaced in several regions across the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak of the pandemic is materially and adversely affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The further spread of COVID-19, and the requirement to take action to limit the spread of the illness, may impact our ability to carry out our business as usual and may materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business and financial condition, including our potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented additional safety measures in its patient services locations and its corporate headquarters.
Significant Liquidity Events
Through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations principally through a combination of sales of our common stock, convertible promissory notes, government issued debt, and related party debt, as described below.
Registered Direct Offering - August 2021
On August 26, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a certain institutional investor (the “Purchaser”) pursuant to which we agreed to sell in a registered direct offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”) 3,703,704 shares of our common stock to the Purchaser at an offering price of $0.54 per share. In a concurrent private placement, we also sold to the Purchaser unregistered warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,851,852 shares of our common stock, representing 50% of the shares of common stock that were purchased in the Registered Direct Offering. The Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.65 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and have a term of exercise equal to five years from the date of issuance. We also issued compensation warrants to our placement agent to purchase up to 269,269 shares of common stock, equal to 8.0% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock placed in the Registered Direct Offering. The placement agent warrants have a term of five (5) years from the commencement of sales under the Registered Direct Offering and an exercise price of $0.675 per share of common stock (equal to 125% of the offering price per share of common stock in the Registered Direct Offering).
We received net proceeds from the in the Registered Direct Offering, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us, of $1,719,921. The transactions closed on August 31, 2021.
2021 Equity Transactions
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 13,161,943 shares of common stock in 53 separate private placement transactions. We received $4,328,725 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with these stock sales, we also issued 6,581,527 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices between $0.27 and $1.05 per share.
Plan of operation and future funding requirements
Our plan of operations is to profitably operate our Health Services business and continue to invest in our Digital Healthcare business, including our cloud-based online personal medical information and record archiving system, the “HealthLynked Network.”
We intend to market the HealthLynked Network through top level sales efforts with our new VP of sales Jeffrey Cohen targeting large health systems, hospitals and Universities. In addition, we will market via telesales targeting physicians’ offices, direct to patient marketing, affiliated marketing campaigns, co-marketing with our Medical Distribution businesses retailer MOD, and expanded southeast regional sales efforts. We intend that our initial primary sales strategy will be physician telesales through the use of telesales representatives whom we will hire as access to capital allows. In combination with our telesales, we intend to also utilize Internet based marketing to increase penetration to targeted geographical areas. These campaigns will be focused on both physician providers and patient members. We also intend to leverage MOD’s discounted medical supplies as an offering to our patient and physician members in both the HealthLynked Network and our ACO network and plans. If we fail to complete the development of, or successfully market, the HealthLynked Network, our ability to realize future increases in revenue and operating profits could be impacted, and our results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected.
A summarized timeline of our strategic acquisition transactions and the related funding sources is as follows:
● On April 15, 2019, we acquired HCFM for $750,000 in cash, $750,000 in shares of our common stock and $500,000 in a three-year performance-based payout.
● On May 18, 2020, we acquired CHM for $214,000 in cash, $201,675 in shares of our common stock, up to $223,000 cash and $660,000 in shares of our common stock based on a target MSSP payment of $1,725,000 in the current year, and up to $437,500 in a four-year performance-based payout.
● On August 20, 2020, we completed the August 2020 Equity Transaction with Trusts controlled by our CEO, Dr. Michael Dent, pursuant to which the Trusts contributed an aggregate of 76,026 NEO Shares with a fair value of $3,066,889 to us, in exchange for an aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Preferred Stock and an aggregate of 24,522,727 shares of our common stock (see Note 4 - Marketable Securities of our consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).
● On October 19, 2020, we acquired MOD, a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States, in exchange for (i) 19,045,563 restricted shares of our common stock valued at $2,704,470, (ii) the issuance of an aggregate of up to 10,004,749 restricted shares of the buyer’s common stock valued at up to $2,602,330 over a four year period based on MOD achieving certain revenue targets, and (iii) the partial satisfaction of certain outstanding debt obligations of MOD in the amount of $703,200 in cash by us.
● During the second half of 2020, we retired floating rate convertible debt with a face value of $1,012,750 through conversions and repayments and repaid related party notes with a face value of $646,000 in an effort to improve our balance sheet.
● During January 2021, the holder of $1,038,500 fixed rate convertible debt converted the full face value of $1,038,500, plus $317,096 of accrued interest on such notes, into 13,538,494 shares of common stock pursuant to the original conversion terms of the underlying notes. Following the conversion, we had no further convertible debt outstanding.
● During August 2021, we sold in the Registered Direct Offering 3,703,704 shares of common stock and 1,851,852 five-year warrants with an exercise price of $0.65 to an institutional investor at an offering price of $0.54 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $2,000,00 and net proceeds after offering costs and expenses of $1,719,921.
● During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 13,161,943 shares of common stock in 53 separate private placement transactions. We received $4,328,725 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with these stock sales, we also issued 6,581,527 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices between $0.27 and $1.05 per share. We also issued 3,006,098 shares pursuant to draws under the Investment Agreement for additional gross proceeds of $900,636.
Currently, we are focusing on acquiring additional profitable ACOs with a concentration on physician-based ACOs in Florida, the Southeast, Texas, New Jersey and Arizona. ACOs’ objectives are to reduce patients’ healthcare costs while improving their health. Our initial targets are physician-based Florida Medicare ACOs. Profitable ACOs have shared savings, which are payments made by the Medicare governing body CMS to ACOs whose Medicare patients have aggregate total savings over the regional threshold for all Medicare patients in the territory and that meet CMS’ quality standards. Given HealthLynked’s goal to improve healthcare and reduce healthcare costs for all patients, we anticipate that the ACO acquisition model can help us expand both physician and patient utilization of the HealthLynked Network while continuing to add incremental revenue and profit from to our Health Services and ACO/MSO business units. We plan to raise additional capital to fund our ongoing acquisition strategy.
