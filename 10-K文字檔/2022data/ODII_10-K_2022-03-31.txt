Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed on April 8, 2021, as amended on Form 10-K/A on May 28, 2021. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements, particularly those identified with the words, “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends,” “objectives,” and similar expressions, are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements, except as required by law. Dollars in tabular format are presented in thousands, except per share data, or otherwise indicated.

OVERVIEW
Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on April 12, 2019. The Company acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary, Odyssey Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Odyssey Semiconductor”), on June 21, 2019.
We are a semiconductor device company developing revolutionary high-voltage power switching components and systems based on proprietary Gallium Nitride (GaN) processing technology. The premium power switching device market, which is described as applications where silicon-based (Si) systems perform insufficiently, is projected to reach over $3.5 billion by 2025 and is currently dominated by the semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC). GaN-based systems outperform Si and SiC based systems in every way due to the superior material properties of GaN. However, GaN devices have, to-date, proven difficult to process using standard semiconductor processing methods that are used to create Si and SiC based devices. We have developed a novel processing modification that allows GaN to be processed in a manner that for the first time, makes high voltage GaN power switching devices viably manufacturable. Our mission is to disrupt the rapidly growing premium power switching device market using our newly developed GaN high voltage power transistor for switching applications.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On September 22, 2021, Alex Behfar resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors and a Director. On the same day, Richard Brown was appointed as our Interim Chief Executive Officer and John Edmunds as our Chairman. As of the date of such resignation, Mr. Behfar owned stock options to purchase 2,672,000 shares of common stock, of which 1,911,000 unvested options were forfeited.
On October 6, 2021, in connection with Mr. Behfar’s resignation, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Behfar. Pursuant to the separation agreement, among other things, Mr. Behfar agreed to certain waiver and release of claims in favor of the Company, and the Company agreed to pay Mr. Behfar certain severance consideration, including payment of three months of health insurance premium and acceleration of vesting of 25,000 non-qualified stock options (granted on September 25, 2019 and exercisable at $1.50 per share) which were to vest as of September 25, 2021.
Governmental Assistance
Paycheck Protection Program
On May 1, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $211,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, as amended (“CARES Act”), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of such qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after certain time periods further defined in the CARES Act (“Covered Period”) as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the Covered Period. On March 6, 2021, the entire loan balance was forgiven.
On February 24, 2021, the Company received $193,625 pursuant to a promissory note issued under the Paycheck Protection Program Part 2 (“PPP2”). Interest was to accrue at 1% per annum and the note is payable in 60 monthly installments of $3,300 commencing May 2022, however, on November 15, 2021, the entire loan balance was forgiven.
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance
On May 1, 2020, the Company received an advance in the amount of $10,000 from the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) program administered by the SBA, which program was expanded pursuant to the CARES Act. Such advance amount will reduce the Company’s PPP loan forgiveness amount described above. The Company received an additional $138,900 under this program on August 30, 2020. The loan is payable in monthly payments of $678 including interest at 3.75% payable over 30 years.
Tomkins County Area Development Loan
On May 27, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $50,000 from the Tomkins County Area Development (“TCAD”) Emergency Relief Loan Fund. The loan matures after four years and bears interest in the amount of 2.5% per annum, with one year of no interest or principal payments, followed by three years of monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $1,443 per month. The loan is collateralized against certain assets of the Company.
Equipment Loans
On August 20, 2020, the Company received a loan of $100,000 from Broome County Industrial Development Agency (5 year facility, 2.5% annual interest rate, monthly payment of $1,775); on September 1, 2020, the Company received a loan of $100,000 from Southern Tier Region Economic Development Corporation (5 year facility, 5.0% annual interest rate, monthly payment of $2,072) ; and on September 10, 2020, the Company received a loan of $75,000 from TCAD (5 year facility, 2.5% annual interest rate, monthly payment of $1,331). These loans were used to acquire equipment used in the laboratory, and are secured by the underlying assets of the Company.
Consulting Service
On October 18, 2019, the Company entered into an exclusive two-year consulting agreement with Akash Systems, Inc. (“Akash”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide certain consulting services to Akash in connection with process development and fabrication of GaN-on-Diamond high-electron-mobility transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Pursuant to the agreement, Akash guarantees to purchase at least one wafer per month from the Company for a total of 24 wafers during the term of the agreement, at a price of $85,000 per wafer. The Company delivered 2 wafers as of December 31, 2020, and the contract expired as of October 18, 2021.
COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenues
Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers that require us to design, develop, manufacture, test and integrate complex equipment and to provide engineering and technical services according to customer specifications. These contracts are often priced on a time and material type basis. Revenues on time and material type contracts are generally recognized in each period based on the amount billable to the customer which is based on direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour, plus the actual costs of materials and other direct non-labor costs. We bill customers based upon contractual terms, and accordingly, we have deferred revenues and contract assets depending upon whether we can bill in advance of earnings or in arrears, respectively.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consist of material, labor, a portion of occupancy expenses, and other expenses directly related to our revenue contracts.
Research and Development
Research and development includes expenses, primarily material, labor, a portion of occupancy expenses, and other expenses incurred in connection with the research and development of certain exploratory projects. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are incurred.
Selling, General, and Administrative
Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of salaries, payroll taxes and other benefits, legal and professional fees, stock- based compensation, rent and office expenses, marketing and travel and other costs associated with our operation.
Other Income
Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on cash balances, forgiveness of PPP loan and other miscellaneous items.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with year ended December 31, 2020
Overview
The following table presents certain information from the condensed consolidated statements of operations:
Revenues
Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $749,000 and $1,374,000, respectively, which represented a decrease of $625,000, or 46%. The timing of revenue recognition is driven by the completion of specified deliverables and the billing of time and materials over periods of time. Accordingly, the recognition of revenue for these contracts will vary from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also recognized substantially all of our revenue from one of our government contract customers. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized substantially all of our revenue under six customer contracts, including the government contract and a contract with another governmental entity (comprising 56% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the aggregate). The customer contracts with governmental entities have concluded. We have a few other customers and several outstanding proposals to new customers.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $832,000 and $1,453,000, respectively, which represented a decrease of $621,000, or 43%. The base salary, facility and equipment usage fees to operate the fabrication facility during the 2021 and 2020 periods are and allocated between research and development and cost of revenues based upon the specific projects worked on during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also incurred a loss of $60,000 on one government customer contract due to costs exceeding the contract revenues. We have operated at a gross loss for the past year as our revenues are not yet significant to cover our fixed costs of the facility.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $1,520,000 and $607,000, respectively, which represented an increase of $912,000, or 150 %. The increase was primarily attributable to an overall increase in our focus on research and development activities, which resulted in increased wage allocation of approximately $110,000 as well as increased rent, facility fees, depreciation, equipment usage costs and general lab supplies.
General and Administrative
Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $1,955,000 and $1,354,000, respectively, which represented an increase of $601,000, or 44%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation costs related to options granted to the Chief Executive Officer (including performance awards that related to the private placement that occurred in March 2021) and board members of approximately $623,000 as compared to the 2020 period. Legal and professional fees were approximately $315,000 in the 2021 period as compared to $336,000 for the 2020 period.
Other Income and expense
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes the forgiveness of our PPP loans of $ 404,000. Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes to the sale of miscellaneous tools of $28,000. Other income in the year 2020 was insignificant.
Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $16,000 and $3,000, respectively, which represented an increase of $13,000, or 392%. The increase was primarily driven by a full year of interest on the governmental loans in 2021 as compared to a partial year in 2020.
Net (Loss) Income
Net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $(3,142,000) and $(2,043,000), respectively, which represented a decrease of $(1,099,000), or 54%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues of approximately $625,000 and an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense of $536,000. The costs of the operations of the Company remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and working capital of $2,598,213 and $2,605,432, respectively. We were awarded a grant from the Empire State Development Grant Funds through the Southern Tier REDC in the amount of $650,000 in 2022. Funding of the grant is dependent on the Company maintaining capital expenditure and headcount metrics specified in the grant award.
The Company believes its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to meet its operating obligations and capital requirements for at least twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. Therefore, the Company will need to raise further capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities or other debt instruments to support its future operations. The Company has engaged with an investment bank to assist with the fund raise, however there can no assurance that a financing can be completed on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company has also taken preliminary steps to file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed public offering and a listing application with Nasdaq, but there is no assurance that the offering and the listing application will be successful.
The Company’s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company’s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully commercialize its products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, it may have to curtail its development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately, the Company could be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate.
Our sources and uses of cash were as follows:
Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $(2,457,000) and $(776,000), respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 includes cash used to fund a net loss of approximately $3,142,000, reduced by $922,000 of non-cash expenses, and increased by $237,000 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 included cash provided by net loss of approximately $(2,043,000) partially offset by $859,000 of non-cash expenses and reduced by $408,000 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $(33,000) and $(687,000), respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to the purchase property and equipment, and leasehold improvements in the laboratory.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $4,815,000 and $1,041,000, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to expenditures to the private placement of our common stock which yielded approximately $4.6 million in net proceeds, and the proceeds from the PPP2 loan of $194,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $68,000. Net cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to proceeds under government loan programs of $685,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $405,000.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to, and the consolidated financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments for all assets and liabilities, including those related to stock-based compensation expense and the timing of revenue and related cost recognition. The amount of stock based compensation has been a significant expense over the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The assumptions that go into the Black-Scholes calculation are the major driver of the calculation of the fair value of the stock options at the date of grant. The major assumption of volatility is based upon historical data, and the majority of the other assumptions used in the Black Scholes computation is based upon the terms of the specific stock option grant.
Revenues and cost of sales are important metrics in demonstrating the completion of projects and shipment of products to customers, and the profitability of such revenues. The timing of the Company’s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. A receivable is recorded when revenue is recognized prior to payment and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. Contract assets are comprised of unbilled contract receivables related to revenues earned but not yet invoiced to customers.
We review the status of each project at each period end and determine whether the earnings process is complete and the revenue and costs of sales should be recognized.
