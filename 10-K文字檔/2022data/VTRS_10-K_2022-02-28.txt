Company Overview
Viatris is a global healthcare company formed in November 2020 whose mission is to empower people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life, regardless of geography or circumstance. Improving the ability of patients to gain access to sustainable and high-quality healthcare is our relentless pursuit. One that rests on visionary thinking, determination and best-in-class capabilities that were strategically built to remove barriers across the health spectrum and advance access globally.
Viatris’ seasoned management team is focused on ensuring that the Company is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients, shareholders, customers and other stakeholders. With a global workforce of approximately 37,000, the Company has industry leading commercial, R&D, regulatory, manufacturing, legal and medical expertise complemented by a strong commitment to quality and unparalleled geographic footprint to deliver high-quality medicines to patients in more than 165 countries and territories. Viatris’ portfolio comprises more than 1,400 approved molecules across a wide range of key therapeutic areas, including globally recognized iconic and key brands, generics, complex generics, and biosimilars. The Company operates approximately 40 manufacturing sites worldwide that produce oral solid doses, injectables, complex dosage forms and APIs. Viatris is headquartered in the U.S., with global centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Shanghai, China and Hyderabad, India.
Viatris has four reportable segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. The Company reports segment information on the basis of markets and geography, which reflects its focus on bringing its broad and diversified portfolio of branded, complex generics and biosimilars, and generic products to people in markets everywhere. Our Developed Markets segment comprises our operations primarily in North America and Europe. Our Greater China segment includes our operations in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our JANZ segment reflects our operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Our Emerging Markets segment encompasses our presence in more than 125 countries with developing markets and emerging economies including in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East as well as the Company’s ARV franchise.
Certain Market and Industry Factors
The global pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and highly regulated industry. As a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. The following discussion highlights some of these key factors and market conditions.
Generic products, particularly in the U.S., generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margins at the time of their launch, and even more so in periods of market exclusivity, or in periods of limited generic competition. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results. The entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of the Company’s control. Conversely, generic products generally experience less volatility over a longer period of time in Europe as compared to the U.S., primarily due to the role of government oversight of healthcare systems in the region.
For branded products, the majority of the product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales.
Certain markets in which we do business outside of the U.S. have undergone government-imposed price reductions, and further government-imposed price reductions are expected in the future. Such measures, along with the tender systems discussed below, are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, government initiatives in certain markets that appear to favor generic products could help to mitigate this unfavorable effect by increasing rates of generic substitution and penetration.
Additionally, a number of markets in which we operate outside of the U.S. have implemented, or may implement, tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Generally speaking, tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on sales and profitability. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive priority placement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. The loss of a tender by a third party to whom we supply API can also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability. Sales continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems in certain countries.
Recent Developments
Biocon Biologics Agreement
On February 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to contribute its biosimilars business to Biocon Biologics. Under the terms of the Biocon Agreement, at closing Viatris will receive an up-front cash payment of $2.0 billion, $1.0 billion of convertible preferred equity and up to $335 million as additional cash payments that are expected to be paid in 2024. Viatris will own a stake of at least 12.9% of Biocon Biologics, on a fully-diluted basis, and will have certain priority rights with respect to certain liquidity events. The companies will also enter into a two-year transition services agreement, subject to extension in certain circumstances, during which time Viatris will provide certain commercial and administrative services for an applicable service fee. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022 and is subject to customary closing conditions (including regulatory approvals).
Share Repurchase Program
On February 28, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s shares of common stock. The Company has not yet repurchased any shares of common stock under the share repurchase program and the share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock.
Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion
On February 3, 2022, the Company announced that it had received approval from the FDA for its ANDA for Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion 0.05%, the first generic version of Allergan's Restasis®. Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion is indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, also known as dry eye. The commercial launch of the product occurred in February 2022.
SEMGLEE®
On June 11, 2020, the FDA approved the SEMGLEE® vial and pen products, which the Company began selling on August 31, 2020. On July 28, 2021, Viatris and Biocon announced that the FDA had approved SEMGLEE® (insulin glargine-yfgn) injection as the first interchangeable biosimilar product under the 351(k) regulatory pathway. The interchangeable SEMGLEE® product, which allows substitution of SEMGLEE® for the reference product, Lantus®, at the pharmacy counter, was launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company has exclusivity for 12 months from launch before the FDA can approve another biosimilar interchangeable to Lantus®.
2020 Restructuring Program
During the fourth quarter of 2020, Viatris announced a significant global restructuring program in order to achieve synergies and ensure that the organization is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients, shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders. Viatris’ restructuring initiative incorporates and expands on the restructuring program announced by Mylan N.V. earlier in 2020 as part of its business transformation efforts. As part of the restructuring, the Company is optimizing its commercial capabilities and enabling functions, and closing, downsizing or divesting certain manufacturing facilities globally that are deemed to be no longer viable either due to surplus capacity, challenging market dynamics or a shift in its product portfolio toward more complex products.
For the committed restructuring actions, the Company expects to incur total pre-tax charges of up to approximately $1.4 billion. Such charges are expected to include up to approximately $450 million of non-cash charges mainly related to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges, including inventory write-offs. The remaining estimated cash costs of up to approximately $950 million are expected to be primarily related to severance and employee benefits expense, as well as other costs, including those related to contract terminations and other plant disposal costs. In addition, management believes the potential annual savings related to these committed restructuring activities to be up to approximately $900 million once fully implemented, with most of these savings expected to improve operating cash flow.
Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic
As a leading global pharmaceutical company, Viatris is committed to continue doing its part in support of public health needs amid the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s priorities remain protecting the health and safety of our workforce, continuing to produce critically needed medicines, deploying resources and expertise in the fight against COVID-19 through potential prevention and treatment efforts, supporting the communities in which we operate and maintaining the health of our overall business. As a result, many Viatris administrative offices continue operating under work from home protocols and some of our customer facing field personnel continue on a remote engagement model to ensure continued support for healthcare professionals, patient care and access to needed products. Additionally, all of our manufacturing facilities, and those of our key global partners, are currently operational and, at this time, we are not experiencing any significant disruptions. Current inventory levels, both ours and those in our distribution channel, remain in-line with normal levels.
The global spread of COVID-19 has created and continues to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption affecting the markets we serve, including impacts on supply chain partners, third-party manufacturers, logistics providers and other vendors. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, operations and financial results in future periods will depend on numerous evolving factors that are beyond our control and that we may not be able to accurately predict, and could adversely impact our results of operations in future periods. Due to the Company’s ability to generate significant cash flows from operations, combined with our access to borrowing facilities and capital markets, we believe that we currently have, and will maintain, the ability to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. For additional information, see Results of Operations in Part II. Item 7.
Financial Summary
The table below is a summary of the Company’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period:
A detailed discussion of the Company’s financial results can be found below in the section titled “Results of Operations.” As part of this discussion, we also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measures of “constant currency” net sales and total revenues. These measures provide information on the change in net sales and total revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason.
More information about non-GAAP measures used by the Company as part of this discussion, including adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross margins, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EBITDA (all of which are defined below) are discussed further in this Part II. Item 7 under Results of Operations and Results of Operations - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Results of Operations
2021 Compared to 2020
____________
(1)Currency impact is shown as unfavorable (favorable).
(2)The constant currency percentage change is derived by translating net sales or revenues for the current period at prior year comparative period exchange rates, and in doing so shows the percentage change from 2021 constant currency net sales or revenues to the corresponding amount in the prior year.
(3)For the year ended December 31, 2021, other revenues in Developed Markets, JANZ, and Emerging Markets were approximately $51.0 million, $1.5 million, and $20.2 million, respectively.
(4)Amounts exclude intersegment revenue which eliminates on a consolidated basis.
Total Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported total revenues of $17.89 billion, compared to $11.95 billion for the comparable prior year period, representing an increase of $5.94 billion, or 50%. Total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $17.81 billion, compared to $11.82 billion for the comparable prior year period, representing an increase of $5.99 billion, or 51%. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $72.7 million, compared to $126.1 million for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $53.4 million.
The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the incremental net sales from the Upjohn Business totaling $5.80 billion and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of subsidiaries in countries within the EU, of approximately $206.4 million, or 2%. New product sales of $698.7 million were offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes of $710.9 million. New product sales include new products launched in 2021 and the carryover impact of new products, including business development, launched within the last twelve months. We estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic positively impacted our 2021 net sales compared to the prior year by approximately 2%, primarily driven by a partial recovery of customer buying patterns in the current year.
From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product introductions and the amount, if any, of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of net sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 33% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the year over year increase a result of the Combination. This percentage may fluctuate based upon the timing of new product launches, seasonality and the impact of competition.
Net sales are derived from our four reporting segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ and Emerging Markets.
Developed Markets Segment
Net sales from Developed Markets increased by $1.92 billion or 23% during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the prior year. Net sales within North America totaled approximately $4.59 billion and net sales within Europe totaled approximately $5.84 billion. This increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the Upjohn Business in the current year of $1.83 billion and new product sales, including the portfolio of thrombosis products in Europe acquired from Aspen in the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was partially offset by lower pricing and volumes on net sales of existing products, including Wixela® Inhub®, Perforomist®, Xulane®, and Miacalcin® within the U.S., due to additional competition. Lower volumes were also due to the impact of product divestitures, including certain North American OTC products during the second quarter of 2021 and other products during 2020 as a result of the Combination. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current period net sales was approximately $185.1 million, or 2%. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately $1.73 billion, or 20% when compared to the prior year.
Greater China Segment
Net sales from Greater China increased by $1.95 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the Upjohn Business of $1.93 billion. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately $9.3 million or 4%. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately $1.94 billion when compared to the prior year.
JANZ Segment
Net sales from JANZ increased by $832.1 million or 70% for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the Upjohn Business of $666.6 million, and higher net sales of existing products driven by higher volumes primarily related to Amitiza® and Creon®, as well as the impact of the termination of the collaboration arrangement with Pfizer in the prior year in Japan. These increases were partially offset by lower pricing driven by government price reductions and product competition. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately $2.7 million, or less than 1%. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately $829.4 million, or 69% when compared to the prior year.
Emerging Markets Segment
Net sales from Emerging Markets increased by $1.29 billion or 70% for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the Upjohn Business of $1.37 billion and COVID-19 related product sales in India, primarily remdesivir and ambisome. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, pricing as a result of customer purchasing patterns and competitive market conditions, including for ARV products. The increase in net sales was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9.3 million, or less than 1%. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately $1.28 billion, or 69%.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales increased from $8.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $12.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cost of sales was primarily impacted by purchase accounting related amortization of acquired intangible assets and other special items, which are described further in the section titled Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Additional incremental cost of sales from the Upjohn Business, including the impact of amortization expense, was $3.57 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This includes incremental amortization expense of $2.01 billion primarily for purchase accounting related amortization of intangible assets and the fair value step-up of acquired inventory.
Gross profit from net sales of existing products was impacted by lower pricing and to a lesser extent, lower volumes. Gross margins were 31% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Adjusted gross margins were approximately 59% and 54% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the year-over-year increase driven by the impact of the Combination.
A reconciliation between cost of sales, as reported under U.S. GAAP, and adjusted cost of sales and adjusted gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:
____________
(a)Adjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues less adjusted cost of sales. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues.
Operating Expenses
Research & Development Expense
R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $751.1 million, compared to $555.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $196.0 million. This increase was primarily due to additional incremental costs associated with the Upjohn Business of $81.7 million, higher expenses related to licensing arrangements for products in development, and increased costs for inventory validation batches for certain products under development.
Selling, General & Administrative Expense
SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.53 billion, compared to $3.34 billion for the prior year, an increase of $1.18 billion. The increase was primarily due to additional incremental costs associated with the Upjohn Business of $1.21 billion and an increase of approximately $236.4 million in restructuring costs due to the implementation of the 2020 restructuring program. Partially offsetting these increases were lower selling and promotional expenses, including through our active management related to synergies and certain lower expenses as a result of COVID-19. In addition, the Company incurred lower acquisition related costs of approximately $386.9 million, as the prior year costs included approximately $200.9 million for advisory and consulting fees related to the closing of the Combination, $303.5 million related to the Company’s obligation to reimburse Pfizer for certain financing and transaction related costs under the BCA and SDA and approximately $69.3 million of employee related to change in control and retention amounts.
Litigation Settlements and Other Contingencies, Net
The following table includes the losses recognized in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
Litigation settlements in 2021 include a $264.0 million charge for the EpiPen® related settlement.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $636.2 million, compared to $497.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $138.4 million. The increase is primarily due to additional incremental interest expense related to the debt assumed in the Combination of approximately $247.6 million, partially offset by amortization of debt premium of $60.1 million and by the impact of debt repayments in 2021.
Other Expense, Net
Other expense (income), net includes losses from equity affiliates, foreign exchange gains and losses, expense (income) related to post-employment benefit plans and interest and dividend income. Other expense (income), net was comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
Income Tax (Benefit) Provision
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $604.7 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $51.3 million for the comparable prior year, a change in the provision of $656.0 million. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 was negatively impacted by the tax rates applied to the reversal of intercompany profit in inventory reserve which was recorded on the opening balance sheet as part of the Combination. This reserve eliminates the profit in inventory related to intercompany transactions and changes to this reserve occur as products are sold to third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a net charge as a result of adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by changes in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. Also impacting the current year income tax expense for both periods was the changing mix of income earned in jurisdictions with differing tax rates.
2020 Compared to 2019
Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Whenever the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, since these are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning across companies, or as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures or measures with the same title used by other companies.
Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. Primarily due to acquisitions and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results, we believe that an evaluation of our ongoing operations (and comparisons of our current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of our financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using adjusted metrics as described below, along with other performance metrics. The Company’s use of such non-GAAP measures is governed by an adjusted reporting policy maintained by the Company and such non-GAAP measures are reviewed in detail with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Adjusted Cost of Sales and Adjusted Gross Margin
We use the non-GAAP financial measure “adjusted cost of sales” and the corresponding non-GAAP financial measure “adjusted gross margin.” The principal items excluded from adjusted cost of sales include restructuring, acquisition related and other special items and purchase accounting related amortization, which are described in greater detail below.
Adjusted Net Earnings
Adjusted net earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and provides an alternative view of performance used by management. Management believes that, primarily due to acquisition activity and other significant events, an evaluation of the Company’s ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that adjusted net earnings is an important internal financial metric related to the ongoing operating performance of the Company, and is therefore useful to investors and that their understanding of our performance is enhanced by this measure. Actual internal and forecasted operating results and annual budgets used by management include adjusted net earnings.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company’s ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness. The Company also believes that adjusted EBITDA better focuses management on the Company’s underlying operational results and true business performance and, is used, in part, for management’s incentive compensation. We calculate EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) adjusted for net contribution attributable to equity method investments, income tax provision (benefit), interest expense and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is further adjusted for share-based compensation expense, litigation settlements and other contingencies, net, and restructuring, acquisition related and other special items to determine adjusted EBITDA. These adjustments are generally permitted under our credit agreement in calculating adjusted EBITDA for determining compliance with our debt covenants.
The significant items excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EBITDA include:
Purchase Accounting Amortization and Other Related Items
The ongoing impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions of both businesses and assets is excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets, inventory step-up, property, plant and equipment step-up, and intangible asset impairment charges, including for in-process research and development. For the acquisition of businesses accounted for under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, these purchase accounting impacts are excluded regardless of the financing method used for the acquisitions, including the use of cash, long-term debt, the issuance of common stock, contingent consideration or any combination thereof.
Upfront and Milestone-Related R&D Expenses
These expenses and payments are excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA because they generally occur at irregular intervals and are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations.
Accretion of Contingent Consideration Liability and Other Fair Value Adjustments
The impact of changes to the fair value of contingent consideration and accretion expense are excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA because they are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations due to the variability of the amounts and the lack of predictability as to the occurrence and/or timing and management believes their exclusion is helpful to understanding the underlying, ongoing operational performance of the business.
Share-based Compensation Expense
Share-based compensation expense is excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Our share-based compensation programs have become increasingly weighted toward performance-based compensation, which leads to variability and to a lack of predictability as to the occurrence and/or timing of amounts incurred. As such, management believes the exclusion of such amounts on an ongoing basis is helpful to understanding the underlying operational performance of the business.
Restructuring, Acquisition Related and Other Special Items
Costs related to restructuring, acquisition and integration activities and other actions are excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA, as applicable. These amounts include items such as:
•Costs related to formal restructuring programs and actions, including costs associated with facilities to be closed or divested, employee separation costs, impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, incremental manufacturing variances, equipment relocation costs, decommissioning and other restructuring related costs;
•Certain acquisition related remediation and integration and planning costs, as well as other costs associated with acquisitions such as advisory and legal fees, certain financing related costs, certain reimbursements related to the Company’s obligation to reimburse Pfizer for certain financing and transaction related costs under the BCA and SDA, certain other TSA related exit costs, and other business transformation and/or optimization initiatives, which are not part of a formal restructuring program, including employee separation and post-employment costs;
•The pre-tax loss of the Company’s clean energy investments, whose activities qualify for income tax credits under the Code; only included in adjusted net earnings is the net tax effect of the entity’s activities;
•Other costs, incurred from time to time, related to certain special events or activities that lead to gains or losses, including, but not limited to, incremental manufacturing variances, asset write-downs, or liability adjustments;
•Certain costs to further develop and optimize our global enterprise resource planning systems, operations and supply chain; and
•The impact of changes related to uncertain tax positions and certain impacts related to the Combination are excluded from adjusted net earnings. In addition, tax adjustments to adjusted earnings are recorded to present items on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of adjusted net earnings.
The Company has undertaken restructurings and other optimization initiatives of differing types, scope and amount during the covered periods and, therefore, these charges should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is helpful to understanding the underlying, ongoing operational performance of the business.
Litigation Settlements, Net
Charges and gains related to legal matters, such as those discussed in Note 19 Litigation included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K are generally excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Normal, ongoing defense costs of the Company made in the normal course of our business are not excluded.

(a) Includes amortization of premiums and discounts on long-term debt.
(b) Includes purchase accounting related amortization.
(c) See items detailed in the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Net (Loss) Earnings to Adjusted Net Earnings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities, which was $3.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities and available liquidity will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on debt obligations, and dividend payments. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, fund planned capital expenditures, or dividend payments, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.79 billion to $3.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities is derived from net (loss) earnings adjusted for non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash, including changes in cash primarily reflecting the timing of cash collections from customers, payments to vendors and employees and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to higher operating earnings after adjusting for non-cash operating items. Non-cash operating items increased significantly during the year reflecting the impacts of purchase accounting related to the Combination and non-cash charges related to the ongoing restructuring initiatives. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted in 2021 by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $301.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $183.3 million.
In 2021, significant items in investing activities included the following:
•cash received from acquisitions, net totaling approximately $277.0 million related to additional target cash balances received from Pfizer subsequent to the closing of the Combination;
•proceeds from the sale of assets of $96.7 million, primarily related to a group of OTC products in the U.S.; and
•capital expenditures, primarily for equipment and facilities, totaling approximately $457.2 million. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, capital expenditures for the 2022 calendar year are expected to be approximately $525 million to $675 million.
In 2020, significant items in investing activities included the following:
•cash received from acquisitions, net totaling approximately $415.8 million primarily related to the cash received as part of the Combination;
•payments for product rights and other, net totaling approximately $438.2 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Aspen’s thrombosis product portfolio in Europe along with other acquisitions of intellectual property rights and marketing authorizations; and
•capital expenditures, primarily for equipment and facilities, totaling approximately $243.0 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $3.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $605.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.41 billion.
In 2021, significant items in financing activities included the following:
•long-term debt payments of approximately $4.20 billion, consisting of the redemption of $2.25 billion of the 3.150% Senior Notes due 2021, repayment of $1.35 billion of borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility and the 2021 Revolving Facility, and repayment of $600.0 million of the USD Term Loan;
•long-term borrowings of $1.71 billion, consisting of borrowings of $1.35 billion under the 2020 Revolving Facility and the 2021 Revolving Facility, and borrowings of $360.0 million under the YEN Term Loan;
•net short-term borrowings of $392.1 million;
•deferred non-contingent payments for product rights totaling approximately $456.0 million primarily related to the acquisition of Aspen’s thrombosis product portfolio in Europe; and
•cash dividends paid of $399.0 million.
In 2020, significant items in financing activities included the following:
•net short-term and long-term borrowings of $2.08 billion;
•long-term debt payments of approximately $2.48 billion, consisting primarily of repayment at maturity of €500.0 million principal amount of Floating Rate Euro Notes due May 2020, repayment at maturity of €750.0 million principal amount of Euro Senior Notes due November 2020, repayment of $983.0 million of borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility and repayment at maturity of $50.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020; and
•payments totaling approximately $48.5 million (of the $111.8 million) in profit share payments related to the respiratory delivery platform contingent consideration. The remaining payments related to the respiratory delivery platform contingent consideration are included as a component of other operating assets and liabilities, net within net cash from operating activities.
Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details on other significant sources and uses of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Capital Resources
Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $701.2 million at December 31, 2021, and the majority of these funds are held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company anticipates having sufficient liquidity, including existing borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Facility, Commercial Paper Program and the Receivables Facility and the Note Securitization Facility combined with cash to be generated from operations, to fund foreseeable cash needs without requiring the repatriation of non-U.S. cash.
In September 2021, Viatris filed a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an offer to exchange up to $7.45 billion aggregate principal amount of Unregistered Upjohn U.S Dollar Notes with Registered Upjohn Notes in the same aggregate principal amount and with terms substantially identical in all material respects, which was declared effective on September 28, 2021. The exchange offer expired on October 28, 2021 and settled on October 29, 2021. More than 99.9% of the aggregate principal amount of the Unregistered Upjohn U.S. Dollar Notes were exchanged for Registered Upjohn Notes.
In July 2021, Viatris entered into (i) the YEN Term Loan Facility and (ii) the 2021 Revolving Facility with various syndicates of banks. The 2021 Revolving Facility amended and restated the 2020 Revolving Facility and proceeds from the 2021 Revolving Facility were used to repay outstanding obligations under the 2020 Revolving Facility and the 2020 Revolving Facility was terminated. Proceeds from the YEN Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Revolving Facility were also used to repay the USD Term Loan Facility in full and the USD Term Loan Facility was terminated. The 2021 Revolving Facility and the YEN Term Loan Facility have substantially identical terms to the 2020 Revolving Facility and USD Term Loan Facility, respectively, with the following exceptions: 1) the maturity of both the YEN Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Revolving Facility is July 2026, 2) the pricing was adjusted to reflect current market prices (which were generally more favorable) and 3) the maximum leverage ratio as of the end of any quarter was set at 4.25 to 1.00 for each quarter ending after June 30, 2021 through and including June 30, 2022, 4.0 to 1.00 for each quarter ending after June 30, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 and 3.75 to 1.00 thereafter, except in circumstances as defined in the related credit agreement.
The Company has access to $4.0 billion under the 2021 Revolving Facility which matures in July 2026. Up to $1.65 billion of the 2021 Revolving Facility may be used to support borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.17 billion outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and did not have any borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Facility.
In addition to the 2021 Revolving Facility, MPI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has access to $400 million under the Receivables Facility, which expires in April 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $318.5 million outstanding under the Receivables Facility.
In August 2020, the Company entered into the Note Securitization Facility for borrowings up to $200 million, which was amended on July 1, 2021 to extend the term to August 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Note Securitization Facility.
Under the terms of each of the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility, certain of our accounts receivable secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. The amount that we may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying accounts receivable that are present at such point in time. Borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Facility bear interest at a commercial paper rate plus 0.925% and under the Note Securitization Facility at a rate per annum quoted from time to time by MUFG Bank, Ltd. plus 0.85% and are included as a component of short-term borrowings, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of accounts receivable, net, in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the agreements governing the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility contain various customary affirmative and negative covenants, and customary default and termination provisions.
We have entered into accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our non-U.S. accounts receivable. These transactions are accounted for as sales and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Our factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility, and we do not retain any interest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. We derecognized $29.6 million and $153.0 million of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 under these factoring arrangements, respectively.
We are continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of our future growth. Consequently, we may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. Also, on an ongoing basis, we review our operations including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses as part of our future strategy. Any divestitures could impact future liquidity. In addition, we plan to continue to explore various other ways to create, enhance or otherwise unlock the value of the Company’s unique global platform in order to create shareholder value.
For information regarding our dividends paid and declared, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Long-term Debt Maturity
For information regarding our debt agreements and mandatory minimum repayments remaining on the outstanding notional amount of long-term debt at December 31, 2021, refer to Note 10 Debt in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The YEN Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Revolving Facility contain customary affirmative covenants for facilities of this type, including among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements, notices of default and certain material events, maintenance of corporate existence and rights, property, and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants for facilities of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, liens, mergers and certain other fundamental changes, investments and loans, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, payments of dividends and other restricted payments and changes in our lines of business.
The Company is in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the next twelve months.

The guarantee obligations of Viatris Inc., Mylan Inc., Utah Acquisition Sub Inc., and Mylan II B.V. under the Senior U.S. Dollar Notes are subject to certain limitations and terms similar to those applicable to other guarantees of similar instruments, including that (i) the guarantees are subject to fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws and (ii) each guarantee is limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable guarantor without rendering the guarantee, as it relates to such guarantor, voidable under applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
The following table presents unaudited summarized financial information of Viatris Inc., Mylan Inc., Utah Acquisition Sub Inc., and Mylan II B.V. on a combined basis as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. This unaudited combined summarized financial information is presented utilizing the equity method of accounting.
Other Commitments
The Company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings, tax proceedings and litigation matters, both in the U.S. and abroad, that arise from time to time, some of which could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges against the Company. These matters are often complex and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We have approximately $609 million accrued for legal contingencies at December 31, 2021.
While the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and the assumed legal matters referenced above, and intends to vigorously defend its position, the process of resolving these matters is inherently uncertain and may develop over a long period of time, and so it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of any such matter. It is possible that an unfavorable resolution of any of the ongoing matters could have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price.
In conjunction with the Combination, Viatris entered into a TSA with Pfizer pursuant to which each party will provide certain limited transition services to the other party generally for an initial period of 24 months from closing date of the Combination. In addition to the monthly service fees under the TSA, Viatris has agreed to reimburse Pfizer for fifty percent of the costs, up to the first $380 million incurred, to establish and wind down the TSA services. Viatris will be required to fully reimburse Pfizer for total costs in excess of $380 million. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred $30.4 million and $53.1 million, respectively, related to this provision of the TSA, and approximately $83.5 million during the period beginning on the closing date of the Combination and ended December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to repayment of outstanding borrowings and interest, open purchase orders, post-employment benefit plans, unrecognized tax benefits, capital expenditures, dividends and leases. For additional information, refer to Notes 2, 6, 10, 12, 14, and 16 in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels.
In the normal course of business, Viatris periodically enters into employment, legal settlement and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions. While the maximum amount to which Viatris may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company maintains insurance coverage, which management believes will effectively mitigate the Company’s obligations under these indemnification provisions. No amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements with respect to the Company’s obligations under such agreements.
We have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives and other employees that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.
Licensing and Other Partner Agreements
Under our licensing and other partner agreements, our potential maximum development milestones not accrued for at December 31, 2021 totaled approximately $351 million. We estimate that the amounts that may be paid during the next twelve months to be approximately $18 million. Additionally, these agreements may also include potential sales-based milestones and call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty or a profit share. Refer to Note 18 Licensing and Other Partner Agreements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and, therefore, have been deemed to be “critical accounting policies.” Critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates, which reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have identified the following to be our critical accounting policies: the determination of net revenue provisions, acquisitions, intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration, income taxes and the impact of existing legal matters.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenues in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes net revenue for product sales when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, governmental rebate programs, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. As such, they have been identified as critical accounting estimates. The following section briefly describes the nature of our provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated:
•Chargebacks: the Company has agreements with certain indirect customers, such as independent pharmacies, retail pharmacy chains, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers, which establish contract prices for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Such credits are called chargebacks. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. We continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available. A change of 5% would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $29.6 million.
•Rebates, promotional programs and other sales allowances: this category includes rebate and other programs to assist in product sales. These programs generally provide that the customer receives credit directly related to the amount of purchases or credits upon the attainment of pre-established volumes. Also included in this category are prompt pay discounts, administrative fees and price adjustments to reflect decreases in the selling prices of products. A change of 5% would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $68.7 million.
•Returns: consistent with industry practice, Viatris maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product, which varies country by country in accordance with local practices, generally within a specified period prior (six months) and subsequent (twelve months) to the expiration date. The Company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns. Generally, returned products are destroyed and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit. A change of 5% would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $34.3 million.
•Governmental rebate programs: government reimbursement programs in the U.S. include Medicare, Medicaid, and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs established according to statute, regulations and policy. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products that are covered by the Medicaid program are required to pay rebates to each state based on a statutory formula set forth in the Social Security Act. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain discounted prescription drug coverage from private sector providers. In addition, certain states have also implemented supplemental rebate programs that obligate manufacturers to pay rebates in excess of those required under federal law. Our estimate of these rebates is based on the historical trends of rebates paid as well as on changes in wholesaler inventory levels and increases or decreases in the level of sales. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap” based on historical experience of prescriptions and utilization expected to result in the discount of the “coverage gap”.
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales are contractually or legislatively governed. In certain European countries, certain rebates are calculated on the governments total pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale thresholds. We utilize historical data and obtain third party information to determine the adequacy of these accruals. Also, this provision includes price reductions that are mandated by law outside of the U.S.
A change of 5% would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $20.0 million.
The following is a rollforward of the categories of variable consideration during 2021:
Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net revenues and in accounts receivable and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions, which were comprised of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
We have not made and do not anticipate making any significant changes to the methodologies that we use to measure provisions for variable consideration; however, the balances within these reserves can fluctuate significantly through the consistent application of our methodologies. Historically, we have not recorded in any current period any material amounts related to adjustments made to prior period reserves.
Acquisitions, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Contingent Consideration
The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire businesses is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized at the date of acquisition and, at that time, such IPR&D assets have indefinite lives. As products in development are approved for sale, amounts are allocated to product rights and licenses and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions and Other Transactions included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further additional information regarding the Company’s acquisitions, including the acquisition accounting related to the Combination.
Purchases of developed products and licenses that are accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over an estimated useful life. IPR&D assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition are expensed immediately if they have no alternative future uses.
The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows. Because this process involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volumes, pricing, new product launches, government reform actions, anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions, and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
The Company records contingent consideration resulting from business acquisitions at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies, net within the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps, regulatory approvals, market launches, sales targets and profitability. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
Significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units as compared to their related carrying value. Under the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount is less than its fair value, then no impairment is recognized. If the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2021 on a quantitative basis for its five reporting units, North America, Europe, Emerging Markets, JANZ, and Greater China. Additionally, the net assets acquired as part of the Combination were included in the respective reporting units and in the annual impairment test for the first time. In estimating each reporting unit’s fair value, the Company performed an extensive valuation analysis, utilizing both income and market-based approaches. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, market multiples, control premiums, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting units.
Income Approach: Under this approach, to determine fair value, we discounted the expected future cash flows of each reporting unit. We used a discount rate, which reflected the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would have expected to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we used EBITDA in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption, and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value.
Market-Based Approach: The Company also utilizes a market-based approach to estimate fair value, principally utilizing the guideline company method which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to a select group of publicly traded companies with reasonably similar guidelines.
As of April 1, 2021, the allocation of the Company’s total goodwill was as follows: North America $3.66 billion, Europe $5.15 billion, Emerging Markets $1.58 billion, JANZ $0.82 billion and Greater China $0.70 billion.
As of April 1, 2021, the Company determined that the fair value of the North America, Emerging Markets and Greater China reporting units was substantially in excess of the respective unit’s carrying value.
For the Europe reporting unit, the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately $0.91 billion or 5.8% for the annual goodwill impairment test. As it relates to the income approach for the Europe reporting unit at April 1, 2021, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 3.0%. A terminal year value was calculated with a 0.9% revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 10.5% and the estimated tax rate was 19.0%. Under the market-based approach, we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 7.5 to 8.5 times EBITDA plus a control premium of 15.0%. If all other assumptions are held constant, a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 2.9% or an increase in discount rate by 1.5% would result in an impairment charge for the Europe reporting unit.
For the JANZ reporting unit, the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately $0.23 billion or 7.0% for the annual goodwill impairment test. As it relates to the income approach for the JANZ reporting unit at April 1, 2021, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately negative 1.5%. A terminal year value was calculated with a 0.7% revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 8.5% and the estimated tax rate was 30.5%. Under the market-based approach, we utilized an estimated market multiple of 6.0 times EBITDA plus a control premium of 15.0%. If all other assumptions are held constant, a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 4.2% or an increase in discount rate by 2.0% would result in an impairment charge for the JANZ reporting unit.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions, especially as they relate to the key assumptions detailed, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
The carrying values of long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are evaluated periodically in relation to the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets and monitored for other potential triggering events. We have assessed the recoverability of certain long-lived assets, principally finite-lived intangible assets, contained within the reporting units whenever certain impairment indicators are present. Any impairment of these assets must be considered prior to our impairment review of goodwill. The assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows.
Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $83.4 million (related to the sale of a group of OTC products in the U.S.), $45.0 million, and $42.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges for finite-lived intangible assets, which were recorded as a component of amortization expense. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets totaled $26.09 billion and $29.60 billion, respectively. Changes to any of the Company’s assumptions related to the estimated fair value based on the discounted cash flows, including discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets, could lead to future material impairment charges. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, principally IPR&D, are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The impairment test for IPR&D consists of a comparison of the asset’s fair value with its carrying value. Impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of IPR&D assets, which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans, is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $19.4 million, $37.4 million, and $138.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges, which were recorded as a component of amortization expense. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s IPR&D assets totaled $46.5 million and $80.7 million, respectively.
The fair value of both IPR&D and finite-lived intangible assets was determined based upon detailed valuations employing the income approach which utilized Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 9 Financial Instruments and Risk Management included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes to any of the Company’s assumptions including changes to or abandonment of development programs, regulatory timelines, discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges.
Income Taxes
We compute our income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax reliefs available to Viatris in the various jurisdictions in which we generate income. Significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves in accordance with Viatris’ policy regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Our policy provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in Viatris’ financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. Our provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution or expiration of the underlying statutes of limitation. Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2021, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $322.9 million, of which $264.0 million was recorded in connection with the Combination and is subject to Pfizer’s indemnification obligations to Viatris under the Tax Matters Agreement.
Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in certain taxing jurisdictions over the three-year period ended December 31, 2021. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth.
Based on this evaluation and other factors, as of December 31, 2021, a valuation allowance of $780.4 million has been recorded in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers all available evidence, including historical information, long-term forecasts of future taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances can result from a complex series of estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, assumptions and judgments, actual results could differ materially. Any future increases to the Company’s valuation allowances could materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s net deferred tax assets totaled $1.33 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively.
A variance of 5% between estimated reserves and valuation allowances and actual resolution and realization of these tax items would have an effect on our reserve balance and valuation allowance of approximately $55.1 million.
Legal Matters
Viatris is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
A variance of 5% between estimated and recorded litigation reserves and actual resolution of certain legal matters would have an effect on our litigation reserve balance of approximately $30.4 million. Refer to Note 19 Litigation included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of litigation matters.
Impact of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation
Because our results are reported in U.S. Dollars, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which we operate, mainly the Euro, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling and South Korean Won affect our results as previously noted. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our revenues or results of operations in any of the past three years.
