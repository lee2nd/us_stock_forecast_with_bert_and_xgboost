Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may materially and adversely affect our actual results, which may differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a microglia-focused company dedicated to improving the lives of patients, caregivers and families affected by rare and common neurodegenerative diseases by pursuing the development of disease-modifying therapeutics to restore the vigilance of microglia. Microglia are the sentinel immune cells of the brain and play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system, or CNS, health and responding to damage caused by disease. Leveraging recent research implicating microglial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, we utilize a precision medicine approach to develop a pipeline of therapeutic candidates, initially for genetically defined patient subpopulations, that we believe will activate and restore microglial function.
Our lead candidate, VGL101, is a fully human monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that is designed to activate Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2, or TREM2. In November 2021, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for VGL101 in ALSP at doses up to 20 mg/kg. We initiated our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial with VGL101 in healthy volunteers in December 2021 and as of today, we have completed dosing of the 20 mg/kg SAD cohort without any safety signals and initiated the 20 mg/kg MAD cohort. We expect to announce topline data in the second half of 2022.
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, research and development activities, business planning, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock, the sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock and a Simple Agreement for Future Equity, or SAFE. As of December 31, 2021, we had $91.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of $140.0 million from the sale of equity securities as follows:
•During the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020, we raised $5.0 million gross proceeds from the SAFE which was subsequently converted to 1,963,093 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock and $25.0 million gross proceeds from the issuance of 9,815,467 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $2.547 per share. Costs associated with these issuances were approximately $0.2 million.
•During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we raised $20.0 million gross proceeds from the issuance of 7,852,373 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $2.547 per share and $90.0 million gross proceeds from the issuance of 25,657,096 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at $3.5078 per share. Costs associated with these issuances were approximately $0.4 million.
Subsequently, in January 2022, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock, in which we issued an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share, for gross cash proceeds of $98.0 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions. We received approximately $88.0 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.
We have incurred significant operating losses since the commencement of our operations. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current therapeutic candidates or any future therapeutic candidates. Our accumulated deficit was $28.5 million at December 31, 2020 and $71.8 million at December 31, 2021, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our current and future therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical development, continue to build our operations and transition to operating as a public company.
Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of expenditures on our research and development activities. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and
development and general and administrative expenses. The timing of payment of these expenses has an effect on cash used to fund operating expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.
We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as we:
•continue our ongoing and planned research and development of our VGL101 and small molecule TREM2 agonist program;
•initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional therapeutic candidates that we may pursue in the future;
•expand our product pipeline based on TREM2 and other microglia targets across multiple therapeutic modalities, through internal discovery and development, or through strategic collaborations or alliances with academic organizations, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies;
•seek regulatory approvals for any therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•invest in capital equipment in order to expand our research and development activities;
•attract, hire and retain additional clinical, scientific, quality control, and manufacturing management and administrative personnel;
•add clinical, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development;
•develop, maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;
•acquire or in-license other therapeutic candidates and technologies;
•expand our operations in the United States and to other geographies;
•incur additional legal, accounting, investor relations and other general and administrative expenses associated with operating as a public company; and
•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure, either ourselves or in partnership with others, to commercialize any therapeutic candidates, if approved.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our therapeutic candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, marketing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. We may also require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other drug candidates. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We also expect to increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenses related to other research and development activities.
As a result, we will require substantial additional funding to develop our therapeutic candidates and support our continuing operations. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales or other sources, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which could include proceeds from potential collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our therapeutic candidates or grant rights to develop and market therapeutic candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Our failure to obtain sufficient funds with acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including requiring us to have to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the amount of increased expenses or timing, or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. We are subject to a number of risks associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, including potential delays associated with our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials. COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems or those of our third-party vendors and collaborators, and increase expenses, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that are being taken, such as restrictions on travel and border crossings, quarantine polices and social distancing. We and our third-party vendors and collaborators may experience disruptions in supply of items that are essential for our research and development activities. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has disrupted global healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems which could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay, FDA approval and approval by other health authorities worldwide with respect to our therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, our clinical trials may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Site initiation, patient enrollment and patient follow-up visits may be delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 outbreak, travel restrictions, the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring, and difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our planned clinical trials. The emergence of additional variants, as well as reduced efficacy of vaccines over time and the possibility that a large number of people decline to get vaccinated or receive booster shots, creates inherent uncertainty as to the future of our business, our industry and the economy in general in light of the pandemic. We cannot at this time predict the specific extent, duration, or full impact that the COVID-19 outbreak will have on our financial condition and operations. If we do not successfully commercialize any of our therapeutic candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue or achieve profitability.
Exclusive License Agreement with Amgen Inc.
In July 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Amgen Agreement, with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Amgen, to commercially develop, manufacture, use, distribute and sell therapeutic products containing compounds that bind to TREM2. In addition, we are required to reimburse Amgen for amounts it paid to its contract manufacturers on our behalf. See “Business Section-Exclusive License Agreement with Amgen Inc.” and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Amgen Agreement.
As initial consideration for the license, we paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and also recognized an obligation to issue shares of Series A convertible preferred stock with an antidilution provision, or the Related Party Antidilution Obligation. As Amgen reported in its Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on January 11, 2022, as of that date, Amgen owns approximately 11.3% of our outstanding shares of capital stock. As additional consideration for the license, we are required to pay Amgen up to $80.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones for the first monoclonal antibody TREM2 agonist (mAb) product and the first small molecule TREM2 agonist product and aggregate milestone payments of up to $350.0 million upon the achievement of specific commercial milestones across all mAb products and small molecule products. No regulatory or commercial milestones have been achieved to date under the Amgen Agreement. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of low to mid single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the products covered by the license. In the event that the exploitation of a product is not covered by a valid claim within the licensed patent rights, then the royalty rate with respect to the net sales shall be subject to a customary reduction by a certain percentage. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights and (ii) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
In connection with the license agreement, Amgen entered into certain stockholder agreements related to this investment. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Series A Preferred Stock Financings.”
Components of Our Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.
Related Party Acquired In-process Research and Development
Related party acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, expenses consist primarily of the upfront costs to acquire the IPR&D assets at inception of the Amgen Agreement and the initial recognition of the fair value of the Related Party Antidilution Obligation. Upfront and milestone payments are accrued for and expensed as IPR&D expense when the achievement of the milestone is probable up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments made upon regulatory approval will be capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. We did not incur related party IPR&D expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our programs. These expenses include:
•employee related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our VGL101 and small molecule TREM2 agonist program;
•expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, clinical investigators, contractors and contract research organizations, or CROs, that assist with (i) the preclinical studies of VGL101 and (ii) identification of potential therapeutic candidates in our small molecule TREM2 agonist program;
•the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing therapeutic candidates for use in our research and preclinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•payments made under our licensing agreement with a related party; and
•other expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities.
Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. We base these estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. Actual results could differ from our estimates.
Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to CROs, CMOs, central laboratories and outside consultants in connection with our research and discovery, preclinical development, process development, manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory and quality activities. We do not allocate employee costs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs. Our internal resources conduct our research and discovery activities and manage our preclinical development and process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities.
The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by program:
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Therapeutic candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over the next several years as we expect to (i) advance VGL101 and our small molecule TREM2 agonist programs’ initial clinical trials, (ii) develop VGL101 for other indications, including other rare leukodystrophies, and leukoencephalopathies, and (iii) expand our modality agnostic product pipeline to other microglia targets beyond TREM2.
The successful development and commercialization of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our therapeutic candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:
•the timing, design and successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical development activities;
•the sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•effective INDs or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials for any therapeutic candidates we may develop;
•successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials, including under the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, and any additional regulatory requirements from foreign regulatory authorities;
•positive results from our future clinical trials that support a finding of safety and effectiveness and an acceptable risk-benefit profile in the intended populations;
•the receipt of regulatory marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•the establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;
•the establishment, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection or regulatory exclusivity for any therapeutic candidates we may develop;
•patient recruitment and enrollment;
•commercial launch of any therapeutic candidates we may develop, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•acceptance of the benefits and use of our therapeutic candidates we may develop, including method of administration, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•our ability to compete effectively with other therapies and treatment options;
•maintenance of a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of any therapeutic candidates we may develop following approval;
•establishment and maintenance of healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement by payors;
•our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•the performance of our future collaborators, if any;
•development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our planned clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial launch;
•obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
•launching commercial sales of our therapeutic candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the therapeutic candidates following approval.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our therapeutic candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these therapeutic candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time to complete clinical development of that therapeutic candidate. We may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, and, even if we do, drug commercialization takes several years and millions of dollars in development costs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in executive, accounting, business development, legal, human resources and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support the continued research and development of our programs and the growth of our business. We also anticipate incurring additional expenses associated with operating as a public company, including increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance, investor and public relations and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.
Other Income (Expense)
Change in Fair Value of Related Party Antidilution Obligation
Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we agreed to issue Amgen equity in an amount equal to 25% of our capital stock on a fully diluted basis until such time as we have raised an aggregate of $45.0 million in net cash proceeds from financing activities relating to dilutive transactions including the Related Party Antidilution Obligation. In September 2020, we completed the first closing pursuant to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, and as a result issued Amgen 6,928,566 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock such that Amgen’s ownership represented 25% of the post-closing capitalization on a fully diluted basis. The Related Party Antidilution Obligation was separately exercisable from the Amgen Agreement and was classified as a liability and recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding charge to research and development at inception of the license agreement in July of 2020. The Related Party Antidilution Obligation was remeasured at fair value at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in change in fair value of Related Party Antidilution Obligation in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. In September 2020, the Related Party Antidilution Obligation was partially settled through the issuance of 6,928,566 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $17.5 million. In May 2021, we settled the remaining Related Party Antidilution Obligation in full with the second closing pursuant to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. Amgen received an additional 1,963,093 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $5.1 million.
Change in Fair Value of Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation
In September 2020, we entered into the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and issued 9,815,467 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $2.547 per share, for gross cash proceeds of $25.0 million. The gross proceeds were offset by $0.2 million of issuance costs and $0.2 million related to the Series A Preferred Tranche Obligation, discussed below. Concurrently with this issuance, the SAFE converted to 1,963,093 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock. As part of the September 2020 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the investors were contingently obligated to purchase 7,852,373 additional shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at $2.547 per share upon the satisfaction of specified research and development milestones, collectively, the Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation. The Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation was legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series A convertible preferred stock. As such, we allocated the proceeds from the September 2020 issuance between the Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation and the Series A convertible preferred stock. As the Series A convertible preferred stock is redeemable upon a deemed liquidation event at the election of the holder controlled Board, and therefore outside of the control of our company, the Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation was classified as a liability and recorded at its fair value. The Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation was remeasured at fair value at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in change in fair value of Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents. We expect our interest income will increase slightly as we invest the cash received from our sales of Series B preferred stock and the net proceeds from our IPO. Interest income was immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2021, and the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020.
Other Expense, net
Other expense, net includes gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into our functional currency. Other expense, net was immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2021, and the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and tax credits will be realized. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $45.6 million and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $45.0 million which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2035. The total federal NOL of $45.6 million are not subject to expiration. As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal and state tax research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, to offset future tax liabilities, which begin to expire in 2035. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had no unrecognized tax benefits.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020:
Related Party Acquired In-process Research and Development Expenses
We did not incur any related party acquired IPR&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. Related party acquired IPR&D expenses was $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted of the costs to acquire the IPR&D assets at inception of the Amgen Agreement, including (i) $20.4 million initial recognition of a Related Party Antidilution Obligation that obligates us to issue shares of the Series A convertible preferred stock equal to 25% of our capital stock until we have raised $45.0 million in net cash proceeds from equity financings and (ii) the upfront cash consideration for the license arrangement of $0.5 million.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $4.5 million for the period June 22, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020. The increase of $27.8 million consisted primarily of the following:
•$7.6 million of external manufacturing expenses related to the development and manufacturing of VGL101, which was primarily incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. These manufacturing expenses are primarily related to the drug substance manufacturing of VGL101, which we expect to use in conducting our clinical trials;
•$6.8 million of other VGL101 program expenses, including $3.5 million associated with IND-enabling studies;
•$4.5 million of small molecule TREM2 agonist program expenses;
•$2.8 million of external costs and other expenses; and
•$6.1 million of facilities, personnel-related and other expenses, of which $5.4 million related to personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation of $0.7 million
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.8 million for the period June 22, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020. The increase of $8.3 million consisted primarily of the following:
•$3.5 million of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation of $1.1 million;
•$3.4 million of professional fees, including legal, accounting and other expenses; and
•$1.4 million of other general and administrative expenses
Change in Fair Value of Related Party Antidilution Obligation
The change in fair value of Related Party Antidilution Obligation was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.3 million for the period June 22, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020. This decrease of $0.5 million was related to the re-measurement to fair value of the Related Party Antidilution Obligation associated with the Amgen Agreement as well as the partial settlement of the Related Party Antidilution Obligation which was fully settled in May 2021. On September 18, 2020, we completed the first closing pursuant to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement which triggered the partial settlement of the Related Party Antidilution Obligation resulting in the issuance of 6,928,566 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock to Amgen. On May 28, 2021, we completed the second closing pursuant to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement which resulted in our raising of net cash proceeds from financing activities in excess of the $45.0 million Related Party Antidilution Obligation cap. The second closing triggered the settlement of the remaining Related Party Antidilution Obligation, resulting in the issuance of 1,963,093 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to Amgen with a fair value of $5.1 million.
Change in Fair Value of Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation
The change in fair value of Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation was $24 thousand for the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020 as compared to $28 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase of $4 thousand related to the remeasurement to fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation associated with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. In May 2021, we settled the Series A Tranche Obligation with the issuance of 7,852,373 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of our therapeutic candidates. Since our inception through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations with net proceeds from sales of our convertible preferred stock and SAFE of $139.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $91.4 million.
In January 2022, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock, in which we issued an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of common stock, at a price of $14.00 per share, for gross cash proceeds of $98.0 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions. We received approximately $88.0 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses
Based on our current operating plan, we expect the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our existing cash, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of $43.3 million, partially offset by (i) $0.6 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities, (ii) $0.8 million change in Related Party Antidilution Obligation, (iii) $2.1 million stock-based compensation expense, and (iv) $0.3 million change in operating lease expenses. The net loss primarily consisted of $32.3 million of research and development expenses, $10.1 million of general and administrative expenses and a $0.8 million unfavorable change in fair value of Related Party Antidilution Obligation.
During the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020, operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of $28.5 million, partially offset by (i) $20.9 million acquired IPR&D fee associated with the Amgen Agreement, (ii) $1.3 million change in Related Party Antidilution Obligation, (iii) $0.8 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities and (iv) $0.3 million stock-based compensation expense. The net loss consisted of $20.9 million of related party acquired IPR&D, $4.5 million of research and development expenses, $1.8 million of general and administrative expenses and a $1.3 million unfavorable change in fair value of Related Party Antidilution.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by investing activities consisted of $0.2 million of capital expenditures.
During the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020, net cash used by investing activities consisted of $0.5 million paid as part of the Amgen Agreement.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $20.0 million gross proceeds from the issuance of 7,852,373 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $2.547 per share, and $90.0 million gross proceeds from the issuance of 25,657,096 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at $3.5078 per share, offset by approximately $0.4 million of issuance costs.
During the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $5.0 million in gross proceeds from the SAFE and $25.0 million gross proceeds from the issuance of 9,815,467 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $2.547 per share. The gross proceeds are partially offset by approximately $0.2 million of issuance costs during the period from June 22, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020.
Our primary uses of cash are to fund our research and development activities related to our VGL101 and small molecule TREM2 agonist program, hiring personnel, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
We currently have no ongoing material financing commitments that are expected to affect our liquidity over the next five years, other than our lease obligations and a $0.9 million standby letter of credit we entered into in September 2021, in connection with a lease for laboratory and office space in Watertown, Massachusetts. The standby letter of credit expires in December 2032. See “Contractual Obligations and Commitments”.
Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development of, receive regulatory approval for, and commercialize, VGL101, and we do not know when, or if at all, that will occur. We expect our expenses and capital requirements to increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for our VGL101 and small molecule TREM2 agonist program. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, marketing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. We may also require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other drug candidates. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will require substantial additional funding to develop our therapeutic candidates and support our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the initiation, scope, progress, timing, results and costs of product discovery, preclinical studies and clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates or any future candidates we may develop;
•our ability to maintain our relationship with Amgen and any other key licensors or collaborators;
•the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;
•the costs, timing and outcome of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more preclinical studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect or change their requirements on studies that had previously been agreed to;
•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we enter into;
•the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under collaboration agreements, if any;
•the costs to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•the extent to which we acquire or in-license other therapeutic candidates and technologies;
•the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production;
•the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory approvals to market our therapeutic candidates; and
•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.
Identifying potential therapeutic candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our therapeutic candidates. In addition, our therapeutic candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate significant revenue from product sales or other sources, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, which could include proceeds from potential collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other similar arrangements with third parties. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt
securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Any future debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, selling or licensing our assets, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or encumbering our assets to secure future indebtedness. Such restrictions could adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business plan.
If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or therapeutic candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our therapeutic candidates or grant rights to develop and market therapeutic candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We expect our existing cash, and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024 at which point we would need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our operating and finance lease commitments as of December 31, 2021:
In September 2021, we entered into a lease for laboratory and office space in Watertown, Massachusetts with an initial term of ten years, and a five-year renewal option at the end of the initial lease term. The monthly lease payment is approximately $0.2 million with annual escalation of approximately 3%. The lease includes a $3.7 million construction allowance. The lease is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2022 when the leased space is expected to be made available for use, as such this lease is not included in the table above given the commencement date.
In November 2021, we entered into a statement of work with FUJIFILM for $3.8 million under our existing master services agreement for the manufacturing of VGL101. If we terminate the statement of work before completion, we may be required to pay fees ranging from 0% to 100%. The amount due upon an early termination depends on the length of time prior to the commencement of specific stages of the statement of work. As of December 31, 2021, no significant work had begun. The statement of work is expected to be incurred over approximately 2 years.
Apart from the contracts with payment commitments noted above, we have entered into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice and, as a result, are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation.
We may in the future incur potential royalty payments under license and collaboration agreements we have entered and will enter into with various entities pursuant to which we have in-licensed certain intellectual property, such as our exclusive license agreement with Amgen. Due to the uncertainty of the achievement and timing of the events requiring payment under these agreements, the amounts to be paid by us are not fixed or determinable at this time.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and the disclosure of our contingent liabilities in our financial statements. We
base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited financial statements.
Research and Development
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. At each period end, we corroborate the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include those related to fees paid to:
•vendors in connection with discovery and preclinical development activities;
•CROs in connection with preclinical and clinical studies and testing; and
•CMOs in connection with the process development and scale up activities and the production of materials.
We record the expense and accrual related to contract research and manufacturing based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended considering a number of factors, including our knowledge of the progress towards completion of the research, development, and manufacturing activities; invoicing to date under contracts; communication from the CROs, CMOs, and other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced; and the costs included in the contracts and purchase orders. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses, however, there is no guarantee there will not be any such adjustments in the future.
Stock Compensation
We have limited public market historical information for our common stock as we completed our IPO in January 2020. Historically, the estimated fair value of our common stock has been determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
Our common stock valuations were prepared using either an option pricing method, or OPM, or a hybrid method of OPM and probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM. Both the OPM and hybrid method used market approaches to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger.
The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of common stock based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. A discount for lack of marketability of the common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.
The hybrid method is a hybrid between the PWERM and OPM, estimating the probability-weighted value across multiple scenarios but using the OPM to estimate the allocation of value within one or more of those scenarios. When using the hybrid method, we assumed two scenarios: an IPO scenario and a sale scenario. The IPO scenario estimated an equity value based on the guideline public company method under a market approach. The guideline public companies considered for this scenario consist of biopharmaceutical companies with recently completed initial public offerings. We converted our estimated future value in an IPO to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The equity value for the sale scenario was estimated using the price of a recently issued preferred security, as well as a milestone-based tranche closing. We utilized an option pricing model to quantify or attribute value to these economic rights of convertible preferred stock as compared to the common stock, such as liquidation preferences, dividend provisions, and participation rights after liquidation preferences.
These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $1.89 as of September 18, 2020, $3.78 as of May 1, 2021, $6.02 as of July 21, 2021, $9.57 as of October 14, 2021 and $11.79 as of November 19, 2021. In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date, including:
•the prices at which we sold shares of preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;
•the progress of our research and development programs, including the status and results of preclinical studies for our therapeutic candidates;
•our stage of development and our business strategy;
•external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry and trends within the biopharmaceutical industry;
•our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;
•the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock;
•significant changes to the key assumptions underlying the factors used could have resulted in different fair values of common stock at each valuation date;
•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering, or IPO, or sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and
•the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the therapeutics industry.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimate, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if we had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of our common stock and our stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different.
In the course of preparing for our IPO, in June 2021, we performed a retrospective fair value assessment and concluded that (i) the fair value of our common stock underlying restricted shares that we granted on July 8, 2020 was $2.42 per share for accounting purposes and (ii) the fair value of our common stock underlying stock options that we granted on November 19, 2020, November 23, 2020 and February 23, 2021 was $3.53 per share for accounting purposes. These reassessed values were based, in part, upon third-party valuations of our common stock prepared on a retrospective basis as of July 8, 2020 and September 18, 2020, respectively. The third-party retrospective valuations were prepared using the OPM or the PWERM, both which used a market approach to determine our enterprise value.
In the course of preparing for our IPO, in September 2021, we performed a retrospective fair value assessment and concluded that the fair value of our common stock underlying stock options that we granted on September 1, 2021 was $6.55 per share for accounting purposes. The reassessed value was based, in part, upon a third-party valuation of our common stock prepared on a retrospective basis as of September 1, 2021. The third-party retrospective valuation was prepared using the hybrid method, which used a market approach to determine our enterprise value.
In the course of preparing for our IPO, in November 2021, we performed a retrospective fair value assessment and concluded that the fair value of our common stock underlying stock options that we granted on November 4 and 16, 2021 was $11.79 per share for accounting purposes. The reassessed value was based, in part, upon a third-party valuation of our common stock prepared on a retrospective basis as of November 19, 2021. The third-party retrospective valuation was prepared using the hybrid method, which used a market approach to determine our enterprise value.
We applied the fair values of our common stock from our retrospective fair value assessments performed in June 2021 and September 2021 to determine the fair value of the July 2020, November 2020, February 2021 and September 2021 awards as of each respective grant date and to calculate stock-based compensation expense for accounting purposes for all applicable periods, from the date such awards were granted.
As a public trading market for our common stock has been established it will no longer be necessary for our board of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for granted stock options and other such awards we may grant, as the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock. Following the close of our IPO in January 2022, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.
Valuation of Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation and Related Party Antidilution Obligation
The Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation was valued using a probability-weighted present value model. The valuation model considered the probability of closing the tranche, the estimated future value of the Series A convertible preferred stock to be issued at each closing and the investment required at each closing. Future values were converted to present value using a discount rate appropriate for probability-adjusted cash flows. The Series A Preferred Stock Tranche Obligation was settled during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The Related Party Antidilution Obligation was valued using a probability-weighted expected return method, which requires a variety of inputs, including the probability of occurrence of events that would trigger the issuance of additional shares, the expected timing of such events, the expected value of the contingently issuable equity upon occurrence of a triggering event and a discount rate. The fair value of the Related Party Antidilution Obligation when it was settled in May 2021 was $5.1 million which was based on 1,963,093 shares of preferred stock issued at a price of $2.589 per share.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS, permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. There are other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act that we are currently evaluating. For example, as an “emerging growth company,” we are exempt from Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would otherwise require us to (1) submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency,” and “golden parachutes;” and (2) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of our chief executive officer’s compensation to our median employee compensation. We also intend to rely on an exemption from the rule requiring us to provide an auditor’s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will continue to remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of the following: (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than $1.07 billion; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
