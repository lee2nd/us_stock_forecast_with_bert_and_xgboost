The Company was incorporated on August 31, 1995 as Visioneering Corporation. In 1999, the Company acquired 20/20 Web Design, Inc., a Colorado corporation wholly owned by Crown Partners, Inc. In August, 2009, Crown Partners transferred its shares of the Company to Crown Marketing Corporation ("Crown Marketing") in exchange for marketing and public relation services to be provided by Crown Marketing.
The Company continues to search for additional areas in which it can generate revenue so that the Company will become profitable but there can be no guarantee that profitability will be achieved in the near- or long-term.
The Company will attempt to carry out its business plan as discussed below. The Company's business plan is to continue building its network of online publishing sites, as well as continuing to provide the consulting and services to its client on an as-needed basis. These services include general and financial management to private and public companies with an emphasis on their financial reporting and filing requirements. Such service is subject to the needs of its clients and may vary by company. The Company will attempt to carry out its business plan as described above. The Company cannot predict to what extent its lack of liquidity and capital resources will hinder its business plan prior to the consummation of a business combination.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING
The Company's existing capital may not be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs, including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any funds will be available to the Company to allow it to cover its expenses.
