In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon our current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part 1, Item 1A, of this Form 10-K and in other parts of this Form 10-K. Please read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Overview
We are a life sciences company pioneering a novel technology for bioengineering fully transplantable organs to help save and improve patients’ lives. Founded in 2009, we are one of a small group of companies at the forefront of developing alternatives to human-donor organ transplants, and within this small group of companies there are important differences between the technologies being developed. Our proprietary technology is a scalable platform that uses a two-step method of decellularization and recellularization designed to remove the porcine cells from the organs obtained from pigs and replace them with unmodified human cells. Our initial development focus is on bioengineering livers and kidneys, and our technology platform is also applicable to bioengineering other organs including, hearts, lungs and pancreases. We have collaborations with the Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai and the Texas Heart Institute, and have received strategic investments from Baxter, CareDx and DaVita.
Substantially all of our revenue to date has been generated by royalties we received from the sale of our biologic surgical products Miromesh and Miroderm, which we spun out as Reprise effective June 30, 2019. We subsequently divested our minority ownership stake in Reprise in March 2021. We continue to receive a royalty on the sales of these products by Reprise. See “Related Party Transactions - Reprise.”
Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33,066, consisting entirely of licensing revenue. Our net loss for the same fiscal year was $14,670,756. We have not been profitable since inception and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $74,051,914.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Licensing Revenue
For the periods presented, all of our revenue consists of licensing revenue pursuant to the Reprise License Agreement with Reprise. Revenue pursuant to this agreement is recognized at the later of (i) when the related sales occur after the minimum guarantee is satisfied, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold relates to our license agreement with the University, pursuant to which we owe the University royalties on our revenues, which are subject to annual minimum payments.
Gross Loss
Our gross loss is calculated by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenue.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, consulting services, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with products and technologies in development. These expenses include payroll and related expenses, consulting expenses, laboratory supplies, and amounts incurred under certain collaborative agreements. Expenditures for research and development activities are charged to operations as incurred.
We expect research and development expenses in absolute dollars to increase in the future as we develop our product candidates. We expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary over time depending on the level and timing of new product development initiatives.
Regulatory and Clinical Expenses
Regulatory and clinical expenses include costs for developing our regulatory and clinical study strategies for our product candidates. These expenses include payroll and related expenses and consulting expenses.
Over time we expect our regulatory and clinical expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we develop our product candidates and move through various regulatory processes. We expect our regulatory and clinical expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily as, and to the extent, our revenue grows.
Quality Expenses
Quality expenses relate to costs of systems and procedures to develop a manufacturing facility that is compliant with Current Good Manufacturing Practices. These expenses include payroll and related expenses. We expect our quality expenses to increase in future years as we continue to develop the process and systems needed to produce our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting and human resources functions. Costs consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, professional service fees related to accounting, legal and other contract and administrative services and related infrastructure expenses.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our headcount to support our growth and incur additional expenses related to operating as a public company, including director and officer insurance coverage, legal costs, accounting costs, costs related to exchange listing and costs related to SEC compliance and investor relations.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of interest under our loan agreements. See “- Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Licensing Revenue
Licensing revenue was $33,066 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $46,530 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $13,464, or 28.9%. The licensing revenue is a result of the Reprise Licensing Agreement with Reprise. The remainder of the minimum royalties due from Reprise for 2020 and 2021 have been deferred to 2022 and 2023, respectively. Due to the uncertainty regarding the collectability of these minimum royalties from Reprise, the Company has set up an allowance to offset the remaining minimum royalty receivable amount.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $500,000 for both the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Cost of goods sold relates to the minimum royalty due to the University under our licensing agreement.
Gross Loss
Gross loss was $466,934 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $453,470 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $13,464, or 3.0%. The gross loss position for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 resulted from the uncertainty of collecting the deferred minimum royalty from Reprise, which was fully reserved against.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $10,750,500 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $7,280,798 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3,469,702, or 47.7%. The increase was primarily due to lab supplies increase of $2,045,138, the hiring of additional employees of $1,101,760, and consulting expense increase of $331,808, partially offset by a contract pre-clinical cost decrease of $245,818.
Regulatory and Clinical
Regulatory and clinical expenses were $551,494 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $265,885 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $285,609, or 107.4%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the hiring of additional employees of $212,427 as well as regulatory consulting expense increase of $50,720.
Quality Expenses
Quality expenses were $547,129 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $149,199 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $397,930, or 266.7%. The increase was due to an increase in hiring of additional employees.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses were $4,643,473 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $2,109,196 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,534,277, or 120.2%. The increase was primarily due to an insurance expense increase of $688,390, hiring of additional employees of $644,545, public company expense increase of $491,705, consulting expense increase of $257,309, office expense increase of $201,991, legal and accounting expense increase of $151,363 and other expense increase of $98,974. These increases can primarily be attributed to the cost of being a public company.
Interest Income
Interest income was $1,973 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $8,733 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $6,760, or 77.4%. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on cash balances in 2021 compared to 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $613,882 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $656,552 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $42,670, or 6.5%. The decrease was primarily due to the interest expense on the Cheshire Note (as defined below) being lower in 2021 compared to 2020, as the note was converted to equity in June 2021.
Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment
Loss on disposal of property and equipment was $5,459 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5,459, or 100.0%. The loss on disposal of property and equipment in 2021 related to the disposal of lab equipment no longer used.
Amortization of Discount on Note
Amortization expense related to the Cheshire Note was $62,638 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $108,620 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $45,982, or 42.3%. The decrease was due to the note being converted to equity in June 2021, and therefore there was less amortization expense related to the note in 2021 compared to 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative
The change in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the Cheshire Note was $246,962 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and ($51,446) for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $298,408, or 580.0%. The decrease was due to the Cheshire Note being converted to equity in June 2021.
Research Grants
Research grants were $393,034 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $992,144 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $599,110, or 60.4%. The decrease in research grants was primarily due to decreases in pre-clinical contracting, resulting in lower grant funds.
Equity Loss in Affiliate
Equity loss in affiliate was $223,633 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $2,358,392 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2,134,759, or 90.5%. The decrease in equity loss in our affiliate was due to the Company owning a smaller percentage of Reprise in 2021 as compared to 2020, as well as the Company selling its remaining ownership in Reprise in March 2021.
Gain on Sale of Equity Investment
The Company recognized a gain of $1,983,912 related to the sale of its remaining 1,800,000 shares in Reprise for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The Company recognized a gain of $2,123,113 related to the sale of 2,700,000 million shares in Reprise for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gain on Debt Extinguishment
The Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $568,505 for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the forgiveness of our loan under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred net losses since our inception. We incurred a net loss of $14,670,756 for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $74,051,914.
We expect to incur additional losses in the near future, and we expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to develop our bioengineered organs, as we conduct clinical trials and other studies for our bioengineered organs, seek regulatory clearances or approvals for Miroliver and Mirokidney, continue preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and to invest in our infrastructure to support our future manufacturing and other activities. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company in the U.S.. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on our ability to, among other things:
● advance clinical development of our product candidates;
● manufacture, or have manufactured on our behalf, our preclinical and clinical materials and develop processes for commercial manufacturing of any product candidates that may receive regulatory approval;
● seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
● establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own;
● establish collaborations to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval but do not intend to commercialize on our own;
● expand our operational, financial and management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, quality control, research and development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts, our general and administrative activities and our operations as a public company; and
● obtain new intellectual property and maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.
To date, we have primarily financed our operations through equity and debt financings as well as research grants. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52,811,531. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from sales of our bioengineered organs, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Additional capital may not be available when needed, on reasonable terms, or at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, curtail or discontinue our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
In December 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement with the Minnesota Agricultural and Economic Development Board under which we borrowed $250,000. The loan was secured by our accounts receivable and bore an interest rate of 6% per annum. This loan matured on November 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding balance became $0.
In January 2012, we signed a promissory note with the Regents of the University of Minnesota for $405,559. The promissory note bears interest at 3% per annum, compounded monthly. The note matures on December 31, 2022 and is unsecured. We are required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $7,737 until the note is paid in full. In connection with the promissory note, we issued the Regents of the University of Minnesota warrants to purchase 80,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.69. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the principal outstanding on this loan was $83,849 and $172,731, respectively.
In May 2015, we entered into a loan agreement with the Minnesota Department of Employment & Economic Development under which we borrowed $250,000. The loan is unsecured and does not bear interest. The loan is due in a lump sum payment on April 1, 2022. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance outstanding on this loan was $250,000.
In October 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for certain lab equipment, which is being accounted for as a capitalized lease. The total cost of the equipment was $102,026. The lease bears interest at 7.2% per annum and we will make 60 payments in total of $1,863 until the lease is paid in full. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount outstanding on the lease was $38,271 and $57,127, respectively. The lease is secured by the lab equipment.
In January 2019, we issued the University a promissory note in the amount of $385,997 in satisfaction of our minimum royalty obligation under the EPLA for the year ended December 31, 2018. The note bears interest at 6% per annum and is due on January 31, 2025. In addition, we issued the University a 10-year warrant to purchase 20,587 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.75 per share. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the principal outstanding on this loan was $385,997.
On March 6, 2020, we entered into a note and warrant purchase agreement (the “Cheshire Purchase Agreement”) with Cheshire MD Holdings, LLC (“Cheshire”), an affiliate of DaVita Inc., under which we received a bridge financing of $6,000,000. In connection with the Cheshire Purchase Agreement, we issued a $6,000,000 convertible promissory note (the “Cheshire Note”) to Cheshire and issued Cheshire a warrant to purchase up to $750,000 of shares of our preferred stock. The Cheshire Note was unsecured and had a maturity date of September 6, 2021. The Cheshire Note bore interest at 5% per annum through and until May 1, 2020, at which time the interest rate increased to 7%. The interest rate increased by an additional 2% on the first day of each subsequent month (beginning on June 1, 2020) prior to the maturity date, provided that the interest rate shall not exceed 20%. As of December 1, 2020, the interest rate
reached the maximum of 20%. Under the Cheshire Purchase Agreement, as long as the Cheshire Note remained outstanding, the Company was required to issue to Cheshire additional warrants on the first date of each month beginning on May 1, 2020, to purchase up to $75,000 of shares of our preferred stock. In June 2021, the Note and all accrued interest was converted to 956,887 shares of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance outstanding on the loan was $0 and $6,000,000, respectively.
On April 16, 2020, we issued an unsecured promissory note for $563,397 under the Paycheck Protection Program through the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which was fully guaranteed by the SBA. The promissory note bore interest at 1% per annum and was scheduled to become due on April 16, 2022. Under the terms of the note, some or all of the debt could be forgiven based upon our use of the funds. We received notification from the bank that held the promissory note in March 2021 that $513,520 had been forgiven, and in August 2021 we received notification that the remaining amount due on the note of $49,877 had been forgiven. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance outstanding on the loan was $0 and $563,397, respectively.
In June 2021, we completed our IPO through which we issued and sold 5,520,000 shares of common stock at $9.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, we raised $44,528,060, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us.
In July 2021, we signed a lease agreement for a piece of equipment that is being accounted for as a capitalized lease. The total cost of the equipment was $44,251. The lease bears interest at 5.0% and we will make 24 monthly payments in total of $1,941 until the lease is paid in full. As of December 31, 2021, the amount outstanding on the lease was $33,597. The lease is secured by the piece of equipment.
In September 2021, we signed a lease agreement for a piece of equipment that is being accounted for as a capitalized lease. The total cost of the equipment was $43,517. The lease bears interest at 6.8% and we will make 36 monthly payments in total of $1,337 until the lease is paid in full. As of December 31, 2021, the amount outstanding on the lease was $38,937. The lease is secured by the piece of equipment.
We will continue to incur additional costs of operating as a public company. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional common equity or debt securities, or enter into a new credit facility. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution and any new equity securities could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. We cannot be assured that additional equity or debt financing will be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing we may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marketing of our product candidates.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $14,809,229 and reflected (i) the net loss of $14,670,756, (ii) net non-cash items of ($1,577,238), including a gain on sale of stock of $1,983,912 and $563,397 related to the forgiveness of a paycheck protection program loan, partially offset by $622,159 of stock-based compensation, $167,907 of depreciation and amortization, $223,633 in equity loss in affiliate, and (iii) a net cash inflow from changes in balances of operating assets and liabilities of $1,438,765.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $6,355,298, primarily driven by the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Items subject to estimates based on judgments include, but are not limited to; the valuation of options and warrants to purchase capital stock and the determination of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations in future periods.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Some of these accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Options
We recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and non-employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective award.
As a result of our Black-Scholes option fair value calculations, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $514,318 and $655,443 for stock options during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, total compensation cost related to unvested stock options not yet recognized in the financial statements was $1,433,087, which will be recognized over the next four years. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which help us determine the estimated fair value of stock-based awards, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. These assumptions include:
● Expected Term: The expected term represents the period for which our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is based on analyzing the vesting and contractual terms of the options and the holders’ historical exercise patterns and termination behavior.
● Volatility: We used an average historical stock price volatility of comparable public companies that were deemed to be representative of future stock price trends, as we have limited history for our common stock.
● Risk-Free Interest Rate: We base the risk-free interest rate over the expected term of the options based on the constant maturity rate of U.S. Treasury securities with similar maturities as of the date of grant.
● Expected Dividends: We have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future.
In addition to the assumptions used in the Black Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.
The estimated grant date fair values of the employee and non-employee stock options were based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
Prior to our IPO on June 23, 2021, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-held-Company Equity Securities issued as Compensation (the AICPA Practice Aid) our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock.
Significant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining the Estimated Fair Value of Our Common Stock
Prior to our IPO on June 23, 2021, the exercise price of our stock options and the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying the options was determined by our board of directors with input from management, after taking into account the relevant valuations from an independent third-party valuation specialist. The board of directors utilized the fair values of the common stock derived in the third-party valuations as a factor to set the exercise prices for
options granted, however management and our board of directors assume full responsibility for the estimates. Our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of each grant based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including:
● the superior rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock, including the liquidation preferences of the convertible preferred stock;
● our operating results and financial condition, including our levels of available capital resources;
● material risks related to our business;
● the lack of liquidity of our common stock as a private company and the state of the IPO offering market for similarly situated private companies;
● the estimated likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an IPO and valuation conditions on our ability to go public;
● the results of research and development activities;
● external market conditions affecting the life sciences industry sector;
● the valuation of publicly traded companies in the life sciences sector;
● valuations performed by an independent third party; and
● general U.S. economic conditions, including stock volatility and interest rates.
Our board of directors intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than fair market value of the shares of our stock underlying those options on their respective dates of grant.
There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the estimated fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates include assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to a liquidity event, or other event and the determination of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share could have been significantly different.
After completion of our IPO on June 23, 2021, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price as reported on the date of grant on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.
Restricted Stock Units
We recognize compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted to employees and directors based on the grant date fair value and they are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective award.
We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $107,841 for restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, total compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units not yet recognized in the financial statements was $317,619, which will be recognized over the next four years. We expect to continue to grant restricted stock units in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, consulting services, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with products and technologies in development. These expenses include employee and non-employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies, materials, consulting, related travel expenses and facility costs. We charge expenditures for research and development activities to operations as they are incurred.
Equity Method Investment
We account for our equity investments in 20% to 50%-owned companies under the equity method as the Company can exercise significant influence, but not control, over such investments. The equity method requires that gains (losses) are recognized in other income (expense), net in the statements of operations. A gain on equity investment in Reprise resulted from recording the fair value of the Company’s investment in Reprise upon losing a controlling interest in the
Company on June 30, 2019. We recorded the equity method share of losses in Reprise for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in the statements of operations. Even though our ownership dropped below 20% on November 15, 2020, the Company still had significant influence over the activities of Reprise due to common board members. We sold our remaining ownership of Reprise in March 2021 (see Note 4 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
License Revenue
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
For our agreements that include sales-based royalties and where the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur after the minimum guarantee is satisfied, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). We assess the collectability of the consideration and only recognize revenue when the collectability of the consideration is deemed probable. We re-assess the collectability of the consideration on a periodic basis, typically quarterly, and recognize revenue deemed probable of being collected.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, companies have extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected this exemption to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2026, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company,
● we may present only two years of audited financial statements, plus unaudited condensed financial statements for any interim period, and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K;
● we may avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
● we may provide reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
● we may not require stockholder non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (1) the market value of our stock held by nonaffiliates is less than $250.0 million or (2) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
