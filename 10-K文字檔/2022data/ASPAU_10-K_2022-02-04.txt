ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors,” our Form S-1 as filed on July 15, 2021.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated on March 18, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses or IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limiting our ability to conduct meetings to negotiate and consummate transactions in a timely manner with potential investors, target company’s personnel, or vendors and services providers.
On August 12, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we sold to our Sponsor in a Private Placement 276,250 Private Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $2,762,500. The Private Units are identical to the Public Units.

Results of Operations
Our only activities from March 18, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to consummate the IPO, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the period from March 18, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had net loss of $1,127,612, which consisted of operating costs of $1,134,803, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,299 and a change in fair value of warrant liability of $5,892.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On August 12, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 5,000,000 Units, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $50,000,000. On August 12, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we sold 276,250 Private Units to our Sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $2,762,500.
On August 19, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intent to exercise of the over-allotment option in part and, on August 23, 2021, the underwriters purchased 733,920 Additional Units at $10.00 per Additional Unit upon the closing of the over-allotment option, generating additional gross proceeds of $7,339,200. On August 23, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Additional Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 18,348 Private Units at $10.00 per Additional Private Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $183,480. A total of $7,339,200 of the net proceeds from the sale of the Additional Units and the Additional Private Units was deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account on that date to $57,339,200.
For the period from March 18, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $768,862. Net loss of $(1,127,612) was offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,299 and a change in fair value of warrant liability of $5,892. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $365,941 of cash for operating activities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $57,340,207 consisting of securities held in a money market fund and government bonds that invests in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2021, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Account to pay our taxes. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a Business Combination, the remaining funds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $154,942. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of our Initial Public Offering had been satisfied through proceeds from notes payable and advances from related party and from the issuance of common stock. Subsequent to the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we expect that we will need additional capital to satisfy our liquidity needs beyond the net proceeds from the consummation of our Initial Public Offering and the proceeds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective business combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating an initial business combination. Although certain of our initial stockholders, officers and directors or their affiliates have committed to loan us funds from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, there is no guarantee that we will receive such funds.
The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management plans to address this uncertainty during period leading up to the business combination. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its plans to raise capital or to consummate a business combination will be successful. Based on the foregoing, management believes that there is a risk that the Company may not have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of the business combination or one year from this filing. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on August 9, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation.
In connection with our initial business combination, we are obligated to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the deferred underwriting commission payable to our underwriter in an amount equal to 3.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering, or $1,500,000, upon consummation of our initial business combination.
Upon consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we sold to our underwriters, for $100, an option to purchase up to a total of 300,000 units (or up to 345,000 if the over-allotment is exercised in full) exercisable, in whole or in part, at $11.50 per unit, commencing on the consummation of our initial business combination. The purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from the commencement of sales in our Initial Public Offering. The option and the 300,000 units, as well as the 300,000 shares of common stock, and the warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the option have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of our registration statement, or August 9, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Derivative Warrant Liabilities
We will account for warrants for shares of the Company’s common stock that are not indexed to our own stock as liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet in accordance with ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASC 815-40”). Such warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other income (expense), net on the statement of operations. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of any warrants. At that time, the portion of the warrant liabilities related to the warrants will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet.
Net Income Per Common Share
We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Common stock subject to possible redemption which is not currently redeemable and is not redeemable at fair value, has been excluded from the calculation of basic net income per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
