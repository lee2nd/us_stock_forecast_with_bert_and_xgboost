The information contained in this report may contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the Corporation and its financial condition and results of operations that involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Corporation's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected or projected as discussed in forward-looking statements. A discussion of forward-looking statements and factors that might cause such a difference includes those discussed in Part I, "Forward-Looking Statements," Item 1A. "Risk Factors," as well as those within this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion below outlines the Corporation's critical accounting policies. For further information regarding accounting policies, refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Management, in order to prepare the Corporation's financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Corporation's financial statements. There are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions. Certain critical accounting policies could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the Corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions. The Corporation has identified the fair value measurement of investment securities available-for-sale and the calculation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, as critical accounting policies.
Fair Value Measurement of Investment Securities Available-for-Sale: The Corporation designates its investment securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading. Each of these designations affords different treatment on the balance sheet and statement of income for market value changes affecting securities. Should evidence emerge that indicates that management's intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable, securities in the held-to-maturity or available-for-sale designations may be re-categorized so that adjustments to either the balance sheet or statement of income may be required.
Fair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flows and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. If at any time, the pricing service determines that it does have not sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security, the Corporation will utilize valuations from another pricing service. Management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service's valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loan and Leases: The Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) on loans and leases are provided using techniques that estimate losses on pools of loans and leases that share similar risk characteristics, specifically identify losses on individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with others, and estimate the amount of unallocated allowance necessary to account for losses that may be present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable. The adequacy of these allowances are sensitive to changes in current and forecasted economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral securing such payments. Management utilizes a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to calculate the present value of the expected cash flows for pools of loans and leases that share similar risk characteristics and compares the results of this calculation to the amortized cost basis to determine its allowance for credit loss balance. The key assumptions used in the model are (1) probability of default, (2) loss given default, (3) prepayment and curtailment rates, (4) recovery delay (5) reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, (6) forecast reversion period, (7) expected recoveries on charged off loans, and (8) discount rate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to establish the ACL, future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and the Corporation’s results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. While management believes it has established the ACL in conformity with GAAP, our regulators, in reviewing
the loan portfolio, may request us to increase our ACL based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted without uncertainty, the existing ACL may not be adequate or increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans or leases deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the ACL would adversely affect the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations.
Quantitative Attribution Analysis
Economic Factors
Sensitivity Analysis
The below table indicates the impact to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases if the factors described below were adjusted in the Corporation's CECL model.
Readers of the Corporation’s financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the Corporation’s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances, business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the Corporation at that time.
General
The Corporation earns revenues primarily from the margins and fees generated from the lending and depository services as well as fee-based income from trust, insurance, mortgage banking, treasury management and investment services. The Corporation seeks to achieve adequate and reliable earnings through business growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
Selected Financial Data
Executive Overview
The Corporation's consolidated net income, earnings per share and return on average assets and average equity were as follows:
2021 Overview
The Corporation reported net income of $91.8 million, or $3.11 diluted earnings per share, for 2021 compared to net income of $46.9 million, or $1.60 diluted earnings per share, for 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation reversed CECL related charges of $10.1 million, of which $17.9 million (after-tax benefit of $14.2 million), or $0.48 diluted earnings per share, was attributable to favorable changes in economic-related assumptions within the CECL model partially offset by a $7.4 million increase in reserves for loans.
The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 included tax-free bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") death benefit claims of $1.1 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share, and income of $15.0 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share, within net interest income related to PPP loans, of which $10.4 million was the result of recognition of associated net deferred loan fees upon forgiveness and pay downs of PPP loans totaling $630.7 million.
2020 Overview
The Corporation reported net income of $46.9 million, or $1.60 diluted earnings per share, for 2020 compared to net income of $65.7 million, or $2.24 diluted earnings per share, for 2019.
The Corporation adopted CECL effective January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases increased by $12.9 million, the allowance for credit losses on investments increased by $300 thousand and the reserve for unfunded commitments increased by $1.1 million, which, in the aggregate, resulted in an after-tax retained earnings adjustment of $11.3 million. In conjunction with this adoption, management adjusted certain Financial Statement line item titles to reflect the new accounting standard. Prior period amounts, which are accounted for under previous accounting standards, are presented on the same line item throughout the remainder of this document.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation recorded CECL related charges of $40.8 million, of which $27.4 million (after-tax charge of $21.6 million), or $0.74 diluted earnings per share, was attributable to changes in economic related assumptions within the CECL model, primarily related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 included a $1.4 million ($1.1 million after-tax), or $0.04 diluted earnings per share, restructuring charge associated with the Corporation's financial service center optimization plan announced during the third quarter of 2020 in which the Bank announced its plan to close or relocate eight, or 20%, of its financial centers. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included a charge of $1.8 million ($1.4 million after-tax), or $0.05 diluted earnings per share, in other expense related to the extinguishment of long-term debt and a $652 thousand, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, gain on sale of investment securities. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Corporation modified the vesting criteria for outstanding performance-based restricted stock grants to better reflect the current operating environment. As a result of these modifications, a benefit of $928 thousand ($733 thousand after-tax), or $0.03 diluted earnings per share, was recognized in salaries, benefits and commissions for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Acquisitions
Paul I. Sheaffer Insurance Agency
On December 1, 2021, Univest Insurance, LLC., the Bank's insurance subsidiary, completed the acquisition of certain assets of the Paul I. Sheaffer Insurance Agency (Sheaffer), a full-service firm providing insurance solutions to businesses and individuals in Central Pennsylvania.
The Corporation paid $3.8 million in cash at closing with additional contingent consideration to be paid in annual installments over the three-year period ending November 30, 2024, based on the achievement of certain levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The potential aggregate cash payments that could result from the contingent consideration arrangement range from $0 to a maximum of $1.9 million over the next three years. As a result of the acquisition, the Corporation recorded goodwill of $3.0 million (inclusive of the contingent consideration) and customer-related intangibles of $2.5 million.
Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and leases and investment securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the principal source of the Corporation's revenue. Table 1 presents the Corporation's average balances, tax-equivalent interest income, interest expense, tax-equivalent yields earned on average assets, cost of average liabilities, and shareholders' equity on a tax-equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The tax-equivalent net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The tax-equivalent net interest spread represents the weighted average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets less the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of net interest-free funding sources represents the effect on the net interest margin of net funding provided by noninterest-earning assets, noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders' equity. Table 2 analyzes the changes in the tax-equivalent net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components.
2021 versus 2020
Reported net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $188.4 million, an increase of $14.0 million, or 8.0%, from the prior year. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $190.5 million, an increase of $13.7 million, or 7.7%, from the prior year. The increase in reported and tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to an increase in PPP loan income of $7.0 million, an $8.2 million decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and growth in loans, primarily commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in loan yields, excluding PPP loans, and investment yields. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.06% compared to 3.16% for 2020. The net interest margin decrease was attributable to increased levels of excess liquidity in 2021 driven by strong deposit growth, primarily due to the various pandemic-related stimulus initiatives offset by the favorable impact of fully forgiven PPP loans.
2020 versus 2019
Reported net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $174.4 million, an increase of $5.1 million, or 3.0%, from the prior year. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $176.8 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 2.9%, from the prior year. The increase in reported and tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to lower deposit costs and growth in loans partially offset by a decrease in loan and investment yields. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.16% compared to 3.59% for 2019. The net interest margin decrease was attributable to Federal Reserve interest rate reductions of 75 basis points in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020, increased levels of excess liquidity in 2020 driven by strong deposit balance growth and lower-yielding PPP loans, which were originated primarily during the second quarter of 2020.
Table 1-Average Balances and Interest Rates-Tax-Equivalent Basis
*Obligations of states and political subdivisions and municipal loans and leases are tax-exempt earning assets.
Notes: For rate calculation purposes, average loan and lease categories include deferred fees and costs and purchase accounting adjustments.
Net interest income includes net deferred fees (costs) of $8.7 million, $893 thousand and ($2.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Nonaccrual loans and leases have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Loans held for sale have been included in the average loan balances.
Tax-equivalent amounts for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 have been calculated using the Corporation's federal applicable rate of 21%.
Table 2-Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income
The rate-volume variance analysis set forth in the table below compares changes in tax-equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, indicated by their rate and volume components. The change in interest income/expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately.
Interest Income
2021 versus 2020
Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $211.9 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 2.6%, from 2020. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in PPP loan income of $7.0 million, offset by a decrease in loan yields, excluding PPP loans, and investment yields.
2020 versus 2019
Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $206.4 million, a decrease of $10.3 million, or 4.7%, from 2019. The decrease in interest income attributable to rate changes of $35.7 million was primarily due to the Federal Reserve interest rate reductions of 75 basis points in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 and its impact on loan and investment yields. This decrease was offset by an increase of $17.4 million attributable to volume changes, excluding PPP loans, which was due to increases in average gross loans and leases held for investment, of $397.3 million, excluding PPP loans, and was offset by $8.1 million in income from PPP loans.
Interest Expense
2021 versus 2020
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $21.3 million, a decrease of $8.2 million, or 27.8%, from 2020. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to $6.7 million decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, due to the current rate environment, and a $1.5 million decrease in interest expense on long-term FHLB advances.
2020 versus 2019
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $29.6 million, a decrease of $15.3 million, or 34.1%, from 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the Federal Reserve interest rate decreases in 2019 and 2020 and a $105.1 million decrease in the average balance of time deposits, partially offset by growth of 12.7% in average interest-bearing liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the issuance of $100.0 million of subordinated notes in August 2020.
Provision for Credit Losses
The reversal of provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10.1 million and the provision for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $40.8 million, and $8.5 million, respectively. Net loan and lease charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $213 thousand, $4.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. See Executive Overview for additional information.
Noninterest Income
The following table presents noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
2021 versus 2020
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $83.2 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 6.3%, compared to 2020.
Investment advisory commission and fee income increased $3.0 million, or 18.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to increased assets under management driven by new customer relationships and favorable market conditions. BOLI income increased $1.0 million, or 35.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to proceeds from BOLI death benefits of $1.1 million.
Other service fee income increased $2.7 million, or 36.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, from the prior year. Interchange income increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to increased customer activity. Mortgage servicing fees increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by an increase in retained servicing associated with elevated mortgage volume and reduced amortization due to decreased refinance activity and lower prepayment assumptions.
Net gain on mortgage banking activities decreased $1.3 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to a decrease in volume and contraction of margins.
Other income decreased $1.5 million, or 24.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Fees on risk participation agreements for interest rate swaps decreased $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in customer demand. Gain on sale of small business administration (SBA) loans increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was reflective of the Corporation's continued commitment to delivering comprehensive financial solutions to small businesses through the expansion of the SBA lending team during the first half of 2021. Other income also increased $347 thousand driven by an increase in the fair value of equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2021.
2020 versus 2019
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $78.3 million, an increase of $12.9 million, or 19.7%, compared to 2019. Net gain on mortgage banking activities increased $12.5 million, or 316.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to an increase in volume and expansion of margins.
Other income increased $3.3 million, or 127.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Fees on risk participation agreements for interest rate swaps increased $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by increased customer activity due to the current rate environment. Gain on sale of small business administration (SBA) loans decreased $482 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the prior year due to decreased SBA loan sale activity. Equity securities measured at fair value decreased $266 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the prior year.
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $1.1 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the prior year due to the waiving of certain deposit service charges for customers in response to COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020 and reduced customer activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
Other service fee income decreased $1.8 million, or 19.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the prior year. Mortgage servicing right amortization increased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the prior year driven by the decline in interest rates and their impact on prepayment activity. Interchange income decreased $308 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the prior year due to decreased customer transaction activity.
Noninterest Expense
The following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
2021 versus 2020
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $167.4 million, an increase of $12.4 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2020.
Salaries, benefits and commissions increased $11.0 million, or 11.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflects our continued investment in revenue producing staff across all business lines and annual merit increases. Variable incentive compensation expenses increased $3.6 million from the prior year due to increased profitability. Additionally, the Corporation modified the vesting criteria for performance-based restricted stock grants in 2020 to better reflect the operating environment, which resulted in a benefit of $928 thousand in salaries, benefits and commissions in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Professional fees increased $2.3 million, or 44.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to consulting fees totaling $1.5 million during 2021 in support of our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program, training initiatives and treasury management product enhancements. Data processing expense increased $1.4 million, or 12.4%, primarily due to continued investments in our end-to-end loan origination solution for loans below $1.0 million, customer relationship management software, internal infrastructure improvements and outsourced data processing solutions.
Restructuring charges decreased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These charges related to the Corporation's financial center optimization plan announced in 2020. Other expense decreased $961 thousand, or 4.1%, primarily driven by extinguishment of long-term debt expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, offset primarily by increases in interchange expense driven by increased customer activity.
2020 versus 2019
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $155.0 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 6.1%, compared to 2019. Salaries, benefits and commissions increased $4.9 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increases were attributable to additional staff hired, primarily during 2019 as noted below, to support revenue generation across all business lines, expansion of our commercial lending groups in the first and second quarters of 2019, annual merit increases and increased variable compensation due to strong mortgage banking activity. These increases in salaries, benefits and
commissions were offset by the $928 thousand benefit recorded in connection with the modification of the metric issued to evaluate previously issued performance-based restricted stock, $1.3 million of incremental capitalized compensation related to the origination of PPP loans and a $994 thousand reduction in self-insured medical expenses.
Deposit insurance premiums increased $1.8 million, or 232.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an FDIC small bank assessment credit of $1.1 million, of which $988 thousand was recognized during the third quarter of 2019 and $114 thousand was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019, and an increased assessment base for 2020 due to asset growth. Restructuring charges increased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the impact of the financial service center optimization plan discussed in the Executive Overview. Other expense increased $1.3 million, or 5.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to charges from the extinguishment of long-term debt.
Tax Provision
The provision for income taxes was $22.5 million, $10.0 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, at effective rates of 19.7%, 17.5% and 17.9%, respectively. The effective tax rates reflect the benefits of tax-exempt income from investments in municipal securities and loans and leases. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate was 21.2%, 21.3% and 21.1% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Financial Condition
ASSETS
The following table presents assets at the dates indicated:
Cash and Interest-Earning Deposits
Cash and interest-earning deposits increased $670.3 million, or 304.9%, from December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased interest earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $678.9 million, resulting from excess cash on hand due to deposit growth exceeding the growth in loans and securities.
Investment Securities
Total investment securities at December 31, 2021 increased $123.8 million, or 33.2%, from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by purchases of $253.1 million, primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, offset by $127.0 million in maturities and pay-downs, sales, and calls, and net amortization of purchased premiums and discounts of $2.8 million.
Table 3-Investment Securities
The following table shows the carrying amount of investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses, at the dates indicated. Held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and equity security portfolios are combined.
Table 4-Investment Securities (Yields)
The following table shows the maturity distribution and weighted average yields of investment securities at amortized cost at December 31, 2021. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because debt issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. Therefore, the stated yield may not be recognized in future periods. Additionally, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are collateralized by residential mortgage loans, typically prepay at a rate faster than the stated maturity. The weighted average yield is calculated by dividing income, which has not been tax effected on tax-exempt obligations, within each contractual maturity range by the outstanding amount of the related investment. Held-to-maturity and available-for-sale portfolios are combined, net of allowance for credit losses.
At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had no reportable investments in any single issuer representing more than 10% of shareholders' equity.
Loans and Leases
Gross loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2021 increased $3.2 million, or 0.1%, from December 31, 2020. Gross loans and leases held for investment, excluding the $452.0 million decrease in PPP loans, increased $455.2 million, or 9.4% from December 31, 2020. The growth in gross loans and leases held for investment, excluding PPP loans, was primarily due to increases in commercial, construction, commercial real estate loans, and residential mortgage loans and lease financings.
Table 5-Loan and Lease Portfolio
The following table presents the composition of the loan and lease portfolio at the dates indicated:
Table 6-Loan and Lease Maturities and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates
The following table presents the maturity schedule of the loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2021. Loans with variable rates or floating interest rates include adjustable rate instruments that may have longer than one month, and in some instances, multiple years of a fixed rate interest period.
Asset Quality
The Bank's strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans and leases. Performance of the loan and lease portfolio is monitored on a regular basis by Bank management and lending officers.
Nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing troubled debt restructured loans are loans or leases for which it is probable that not all principal and interest payments due will be collectible in accordance with the original contractual terms. Factors considered by management in determining accrual status include payment status, borrower cash flows, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.
At December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing troubled debt restructured loans were $33.3 million and had a related allowance for credit losses on loans and leases of $11 thousand. At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing troubled debt restructured loans were $31.7 million and had a related allowance for credit losses on loans and leases of $585 thousand. Individual reserves have been established based on current facts and management's judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits, including the most recent known data available on any related underlying collateral and the borrower's cash flows. The amount of the individual reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits.
Other real estate owned was $279 thousand at December 31, 2021, compared to $7.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease of $7.1 million was related to the sale of a commercial real estate property in the second quarter of 2021 which was transferred to other real estate owned in the second quarter of 2020.
Table 7-Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans and Leases; Troubled Debt Restructured Loans and Lease Modifications; and Related Ratios
The following table details information pertaining to the Corporation's nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.
The following table provides additional information on the Corporation's nonaccrual loans held for investment:
The Corporation modified certain loans and leases via principal and/or interest deferrals in accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus, which permitted such modifications not to be categorized as troubled debt restructurings. As of December 31, 2021, there were nine loan and lease modifications outstanding with principal balances totaling $6.2 million, which represented approximately 0.1% of the loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, there were 72 loan modifications outstanding with principal balances totaling $68.0 million, which represented approximately 1.4% of the loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans. See Table 8 below for a breakdown of these loans by industry description.
Table 8-Loan Concentration
The following table provides summarized detail related to outstanding commercial loan balances, excluding PPP loans, segmented by industry description, and certain loan modifications segmented by industry description for commercial loans and segmented by loan category for other loan types as of December 31, 2021:
(1) Loan modifications referenced above were made in accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus and therefore were not classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2021.
Table 9-Summary of Loan and Lease Loss Experience
The following table presents average loans and leases and loan and lease loss experience for the periods indicated.
During the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded a charge-off of $2.7 million related to one commercial real-estate loan borrower.
Table 10-Allowance for Credit Losses On Loans and Leases
The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, and the percentage of loans and leases in each major loan category to total loans and leases held for investment at the dates indicated.
At December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on individually analyzed loans was $11 thousand, or 0.03% of the balance of individually analyzed loans of $33.1 million. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on individually analyzed loans was $585 thousand, or 1.9% of the balance of individually analyzed loans of $31.5 million.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the Corporation in connection with acquisitions. The increase in goodwill of $3.0 million was related to the Sheaffer acquisition. Other intangible assets increased $3.0 million, primarily due to an increase of $2.5 million in customer-related intangibles related to the Sheaffer acquisition. There was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangibles recorded during 2019 through 2021. There can be no assurance that future impairment assessments or tests will not result in a charge to earnings.
LIABILITIES
The following table presents liabilities at the dates indicated:
Deposits
Total deposits increased $812.4 million, or 15.5%, from December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in commercial, consumer and public fund deposits offset by a decrease in brokered deposits.
Table 11-Deposits
The following table summarizes the average amount of deposits for the periods indicated:
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had $119.9 million and $161.6 million, respectively, in time deposits in excess of $250,000 maturing disclosed in the table below. Brokered deposits in the amount of $15.0 million at December 31, 2020 are not included in time deposits more than $250,000. There were no brokered time deposits at December 31, 2021.
Borrowings
Total borrowings decreased $97.4 million from December 31, 2020 due to $85.0 million of redemptions of subordinated notes, which issued in 2015 and 2016, and a decrease of $15.0 million in long-term FHLB advances.
Short-term borrowings at December 31, 2021 included $20.1 million of customer repurchase agreements on an overnight basis. Long-term debt at December 31, 2021 included $95.0 million of FHLB advances and $98.9 million of subordinated notes. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank had outstanding short-term letters of credit with the FHLB totaling $831.8 million and $669.7 million, respectively, which were utilized to collateralize public fund deposits.
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The following table presents total shareholders' equity at the dates indicated:
The increase in shareholder's equity at December 31, 2021 of $81.3 million from December 31, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in retained earnings of $68.2 million. Retained earnings was impacted by net income of $91.8 million, partially offset by $23.5 million of cash dividends paid during the year. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by $5.8 million, primarily due to unrealized gains of $5.4 million related to the defined benefit pension plans. Treasury stock decreased by $4.3 million, primarily related to $2.2 million of stock issued under dividend reinvestment and employee stock purchase plans and $1.9 million of stock options exercised.
Discussion of Segments
The Corporation has three operating segments: Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance. Detailed segment information appears in Note 23, "Segment Reporting" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The Banking segment reported pre-tax income of $113.1 million in 2021, $53.2 million in 2020 and $74.4 million in 2019. See the section of this MD&A under the heading ""Results of Operations" and "Financial Condition" for a discussion of the key items impacting the Banking Segment.
The Wealth Management segment reported pre-tax income of $8.5 million in 2021 and $7.5 million in 2020 and 2019, which included noninterest income of $27.5 million in 2021, $23.8 million in 2020 and $23.9 million in 2019. The pre-tax income and noninterest income increased from 2020 primarily due to increased assets under management and supervision driven by favorable market conditions and new client relationships. Noninterest income decreased slightly in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to decreased asset values driven by volatile market performance throughout 2020. Wealth Management assets under management and supervision were $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2019.
The Insurance segment reported pre-tax income of $3.4 million in 2021, $4.1 million in 2020 and $4.3 million in 2019, which included noninterest income of $17.0 million in 2021, $16.7 million in 2020 and $17.3 million in 2019. The decrease in pre-tax income in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to increases in salary expense as we continue to invest in revenue producing positions. The increase in noninterest income in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in premiums for commercial lines, which was $7.7 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, offset by a decrease in contingent commission income, which was $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decreases in pre-tax income and noninterest income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in contingent commission income, which was $1.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Capital Adequacy
Capital guidelines assign minimum capital requirements for categories of assets depending on their assigned risks. The components of risk-based capital for the Corporation are Tier 1 and Tier 2.
At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.08% and total risk-based capital ratio of 13.77%. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.76% and total risk-based capital ratio of 15.31%. The Corporation continues to be in the "well-capitalized" category under regulatory standards. Details on the capital ratios can be found in Note 21, "Regulatory Matters," included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K along with a discussion on dividend and other restrictions.
Asset/Liability Management
The primary functions of Asset/Liability Management are to assure adequate earnings, capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management's objective with regard to interest rate risk is to understand the Corporation's sensitivity to changes in interest rates and develop and implement strategies to minimize volatility while maximizing net interest income.
The Corporation uses gap analysis and earnings at risk simulation modeling to quantify exposure to interest rate risk. The Corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long-term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure short-term rate exposure. The Corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the impact of declining or rising interest rates on net interest income over a one-year and two-year horizon. The simulation uses expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates company-developed, market-based assumptions regarding growth, pricing, and optionality such as prepayment speeds. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate assets tend to decrease in value; conversely, as interest rates decline, fixed-rate assets tend to increase in value.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
Interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the Corporation's assets and liabilities. Minimizing the balance sheet's maturity and repricing risk is a continual focus in a changing interest rate environment. The Corporation uses a variety of techniques to assist in identifying the potential range of risk, including a maturity/repricing gap analysis as well as an Earnings at Risk analysis under various interest rate scenarios.
The gap analysis identifies interest rate risk by identifying repricing gaps in the Corporation’s balance sheet. All assets and liabilities are modeled to reflect some level of behavioral optionality, such as prepayments on loans, early call features on investments or potential pricing change and/or product change to interest bearing deposits. The Corporation projects all non-interest bearing deposits to be considered non-rate sensitive. These assumptions are based upon historic behavior; however, they are inherently uncertain and thus cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates. While actual results will differ from simulated results due to customer behavioral change and/or market and regulatory influences, the following models are important tools to guide management.
Table 12-Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap Analysis
The following table presents the Corporation's gap analysis at December 31, 2021:
The table above indicates that the Corporation should anticipate a greater amount of assets repricing than liabilities in the next twelve months. However, this table and analysis is limited as it does not take into account the magnitude of repricing due to rate changes.
Table 13-Net Interest Income - Summary of Earnings at Risk Simulation
Management also performs a simulation of net interest income to measure interest rate exposure. The following table demonstrates the anticipated impact of an instantaneous and parallel interest rate shift, or "shock," to the yield curve on the Corporation's net interest income over the next twelve months. This simulation incorporates the same assumptions noted above and assumes a static balance sheet with no incremental growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next twelve months.
The changes to net interest income are shown in the below table at December 31, 2021. The results suggest the Corporation's year-end balance sheet is asset sensitive as net interest income is projected to increase in a rising rate environment. The Corporation acknowledges that the excess liquidity at year end is materially elevated and significantly adds to the increased asset sensitivity modelled within the rising rate scenarios. Actual results will likely be different than modeled due to changes in excess liquidity and other numerous factors, including interest rates earned on new loans and investments as well as rates paid on new and existing deposits and new borrowings. The changes to net interest income shown below are in compliance with the Corporation's policy guidelines.
Credit Risk
Originating loans exposes the Corporation to credit risk, which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan. The Corporation manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards, guidelines and limitations established by the Board of Directors. Written loan policies establish underwriting standards, lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent. While the Corporation has strict underwriting, review, and monitoring procedures in place, these procedures cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these lending activities.
The Corporation's loan review department conducts ongoing, independent reviews of the lending process to ensure adherence to established policies and procedures, monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations and provides objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.
The Corporation focuses on both assessing the borrower's capacity and willingness to repay and obtaining sufficient collateral. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans are generally secured by the borrower's assets and by personal guarantees. Commercial real estate, construction and residential real estate secured for business purposes loans are originated primarily within the Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey market areas at prudent loan-to-value ratios and are often supported by a guarantee of the borrowers. Management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that any credit concentrations by borrower or industry are identified and managed. See "Risk Factors" included herein under Item 1A for additional information on lending risk related to commercial loans.
The Corporation originates fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying 1- to 4-family residential properties for personal purposes. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-equity ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. Residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the 80% loan-to-value ratio are generally insured by private mortgage insurance.
Credit risk in the consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and, if secured, collateral values. In the home equity loan portfolio, combined loan-to-value ratios are generally limited to 80%, but may be increased to 85% for the Corporation's strongest profile borrowers. Other credit considerations and compensating factors may warrant higher combined loan-to-value ratios. These loans are included within the portfolio of loans to individuals.
The primary risks that are involved with lease financing receivables are credit underwriting and borrower industry concentrations. The Corporation has strict underwriting, review, and monitoring procedures in place to mitigate these risks. Risk also lies in the residual value of the underlying equipment. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, the Corporation bears the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value. The Corporation greatly reduces this risk primarily by using $1.00 buyout leases and equipment finance agreements, in which the entire cost of the leased equipment is included in the contractual
payments, leaving no residual payment at the end of the lease term for the majority of the lease portfolio.
The Corporation closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining asset quality. Collection efforts begin after a loan payment is missed, by attempting to contact all borrowers. If collection attempts fail, the Corporation will proceed to gain control of all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses. While liquidation and recovery efforts continue, officers continue to work with the borrowers, if appropriate, to recover all monies owed to the Corporation.
Liquidity
The Corporation, in its role as a financial intermediary, is exposed to certain liquidity risks. Liquidity refers to the Corporation's ability to ensure that sufficient cash flows and liquid assets are available to satisfy demand for loans, deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings, certificates of deposit at maturity, operating expense and capital expenditures. The Corporation manages liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring liquidity sources and estimated funding needs on a daily basis. The Corporation has a contingency funding plan in place to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or a systemic financial crisis.
Sources of Funds
Core deposits continue to be the largest significant funding source for the Corporation. These deposits are primarily generated from individuals, businesses, municipalities and non-profit customers located in our primary service areas. The Corporation faces increased competition for these deposits from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mutual funds, security dealers and others.
As part of its diversified funding strategy, the Corporation also utilizes a mix of short-term and long-term wholesale funding providers. Wholesale funding includes federal funds purchases from correspondent banks, secured borrowing lines from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and, at times, brokered deposits and other similar sources.
Cash Requirements
The Corporation has cash requirements for various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that require cash payments. The most significant contractual obligation, in both the under and over one-year time period, is for the Bank to repay certificates of deposit and long-term borrowings. The Bank anticipates meeting these obligations by utilizing on-balance sheet liquidity and continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its financial center network, thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market. The Bank will also use borrowings and brokered deposits to meet its obligations.
Commitments to extend credit are the Bank's most significant commitment in both the under and over one-year time periods. These commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon.
