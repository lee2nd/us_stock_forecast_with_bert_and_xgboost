COVID-19 Effects, Actions and Recent Developments
Overview. During 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the President of the United States. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have included quarantines/shelter-in-place orders, the closure or limiting capacity of businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain limitations and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. As the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, its severity; the duration of the outbreak; the impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). COVID-19 has negatively affected, and is expected to continue to negatively affect, our business, financial position and operating results. In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time, but it has been and is expected to continue to be material. The longer-term potential impact on our business could depend to a large extent on future developments and actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 and its economic impact. Furthermore, the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period as the potential exists for additional variants of COVID-19, including the recent Omicron variant, to impede the global economic recovery and exacerbate geographic differences in the spread of, and response to, COVID-19.
Impact on our Operations. In 2020, the State of Texas and many other jurisdictions declared health emergencies. The resulting closures and/or limited operations of non-essential businesses and related economic disruption impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Financial services were identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security. Accordingly, our business remained open and we implemented our Business Continuity and Health Emergency Response plans to address the issues arising as a result of COVID-19 and to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees. Nonetheless, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be on-going, there continues to be uncertainties related to its magnitude, duration and persistent effects. This is particularly the case with the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus as well as the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic could still, among other things, greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism, particularly among key personnel; result in limited access to or closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices; exacerbate operational, technical or security-related risks arising from a remote workforce; and result in adverse government or regulatory agency orders. Additionally, we are experiencing an increasingly competitive labor market due to an on-going labor shortage which has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to staff open positions and/or retain existing employees and has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs. The business and operations of our third-party service providers, many of whom perform critical services for our business, could also
be significantly impacted by many of these same issues, which in turn could impact us. As a result, we continue to be unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown and/or beyond our control.
Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations. Our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations, the availability of our workforce, the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us. While its effects continue to be on-going, during 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. This decrease in commercial activity caused and, in light of new and different strains of the virus, may yet further cause our customers (including affected businesses and individuals), vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. The national public health crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (and public expectations about it), combined with other factors, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruption and further oil price volatility, could, despite improvements in 2021, again destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements could further impact the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers. Borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions, which, in turn, are likely to impact our borrowers' creditworthiness and our ability to make loans. See further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned “Loans” and “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion.
In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits, affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. Consumers affected by COVID-19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over. For example, consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis and certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings) as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction. We lend to customers operating in such industries including energy, hotels/lodging, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate, among others, that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely. Additionally, the temporary closures of bank branches in 2020 and the safety precautions implemented at re-opened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing face-to-face interaction. Our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors.
Legislative and Regulatory Actions. Actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 have impacted our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below.
During 2020, in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, the Federal Reserve:
•Expanded reverse repo operations, adding liquidity to the banking system.
•Restarted quantitative easing.
•Lowered the interest rate at the discount window by 1.5% to 0.25%.
•Reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent.
•Encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend.
•Introduced and expanded several new temporary programs to help preserve market liquidity.
In 2020, the U.S. government enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19. The Phase 1 legislation, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, was enacted on March 6, 2020 and, among other things, authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures. The Phase 2 legislation, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020 and provided for paid sick/medical leave, established no-cost coverage for coronavirus testing, expanded unemployment benefits, expanded food assistance, and provided additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic, among other provisions. The Phase 3 legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), was enacted on March 27, 2020. Among other provisions, the CARES Act (i) authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to make loans, loan guarantees and other investments,
up to $500 billion, for assistance to eligible businesses, States and municipalities with limited, targeted relief for passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and businesses critical to maintaining national security, (ii) created a $349 billion loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) for loans to small businesses for, among other things, payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments, (iii) provided certain credits against the 2020 personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents, (iv) expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional $600 per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each State and (v) expanded tele-health services in Medicare. The Phase 3.5 legislation, the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act of 2020 (the “PPPHE Act”), was enacted on April 24, 2020. Among other things, the PPPHE Act provided an additional $310 billion of funding for the PPP. The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020” (the “PPPF Act”) was enacted in June 2020 to modify certain provisions of the PPP including, among other things, establishing a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the PPPF Act and permitted an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree.
In December 2020, the Bipartisan-Bicameral Omnibus COVID Relief Deal, included as a component of appropriations legislation, was enacted to provide economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in further response to the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the legislation (i) authorized payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year, (ii) extended the timeframe for enhanced unemployment benefits and (iii) authorized approximately $325 billion for small business relief, including approximately $284 billion for a second round of PPP loans and a new simplified forgiveness procedure for PPP loans of $150,000 or less.
During the first quarter of 2021, President Biden signed a number of executive orders relating to stimulus and relief measures. These orders included, among other things, (i) an extension, through March 31, 2021, of the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, (ii) an extension, through September 30, 2021, of the deferral of federal student loan payments and interest and (iii) an extension, through June 30, 2021, of certain mortgage forbearance programs and guidelines.
On March 11 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARP Act”) was enacted, implementing a $1.9 trillion package of stimulus and relief proposals. Among other things, the ARP Act provided (i) additional funding for the PPP program and an expansion of the program for the benefit of certain nonprofits, (ii) funding for the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to make targeted grants for restaurants and similar establishments, (iii) direct cash payments of up to $1,400 to individuals, subject to income provisions, (iv) an increase in the maximum annual Child Tax Credit, subject to income limitation provisions, (v) $300 a week in expanded unemployment insurance lasting through September 6, 2021 and made $10,200 in unemployment benefits tax free for households, subject to income limitation provisions, (vi) tax relief making any student loan forgiveness incurred between December 31, 2020, and January 1, 2026 non-taxable income, and (vii) funding to support state and local governments; K-12 schools and higher education; the Centers for Disease Control; public transit; rental assistance; child care; and airline industry workers.
On March 27, 2021, the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act of 2021 was enacted, extending the bankruptcy relief provisions enacted in the CARES Act of 2020 bill until March 27, 2022. These provisions provide financially distressed small businesses and individuals greater access to bankruptcy relief. We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government.
The above mentioned significant fiscal stimulus and monetary policy actions of the U.S. government and Federal Reserve have been contributing factors to an inflationary surge during most of 2021. As a result, in December 2021, the Federal Reserve released projections related to the target range for the federal funds rate that imply, while there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur, three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in 2022, followed by three in 2023 and two in 2024 as further discussed in the section captioned “Net Interest Income” elsewhere in this discussion.
Banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards. Such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates
We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.
We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements.
Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326 (“ASC 326”) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected.
In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion as well as Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses.
Overview
The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 5, 2021 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2020.
Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. From time to time, we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary. None of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements. We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and as such, the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition.
Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a 21% income tax rate.
Dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts.
Results of Operations
Net income available to common shareholders totaled $435.9 million, or $6.76 diluted per common share, in 2021 compared to $323.6 million, or $5.10 diluted per common share, in 2020 and $435.5 million, or $6.84 diluted per common share, in 2019.
Selected income statement data, returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows:
Net income available to common shareholders increased $112.3 million for 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily the result of a $241.2 million decrease in credit loss expense and an $8.9 million increase in net interest income partly offset by a $78.7 million decrease in non-interest income, a $33.1 million increase in non-interest expense and a $26.3 million increase in income tax expense. Credit loss expense during 2020 was impacted by both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices. Non-interest income during 2020 was impacted by a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions during the first quarter. Net income available to common shareholders during 2020 was also impacted by the reclassification of $5.5 million of issuance costs associated with our Series A preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the Series A preferred stock.
Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 71.8% of total revenue during 2021. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin.
The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2019 at 5.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. During 2020, the prime rate decreased 150 basis points in March to 3.25% where it remained through December 31, 2021. Our loan portfolio is also significantly impacted, by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). At December 31, 2021, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 0.10% and 0.21%, respectively, while at December 31, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 0.14% and 0.24% respectively, and at December 31, 2019, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 1.76% and 1.90% respectively. We discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021 and will negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index, the American Interbank Offered Rate (“AMERIBOR”), a benchmark developed by the American Financial Exchange, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or (“BSBY”), a benchmark developed by Bloomberg Index Services. For our currently outstanding LIBOR-based loans, the timing and manner in which each customer’s contract transitions to AMERIBOR, SOFR or BSBY will vary on a case-by-case basis. We expect to complete all transitions by the first quarter of 2023.
The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began 2019 at 2.25% to 2.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 1.50% to 1.75%. During 2020, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 150 basis points in March to zero to 0.25% where it remained through December 31, 2021. The decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2020 was largely an emergency measure by the Federal Reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19. In December 2021, the Federal Reserve released projections whereby the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate would rise to 0.9% by the end of 2022, to 1.6% by the end of 2023 and to 2.1% by the end of 2024. While there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur, these projections imply three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in 2022, followed by three in 2023 and two in 2024.
We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. See
