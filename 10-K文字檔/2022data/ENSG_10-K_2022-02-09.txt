Overview
We are a provider of health care services across the post-acute care continuum, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and leasing of skilled nursing, senior living and other healthcare related properties and other ancillary businesses located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. Our operating subsidiaries, each of which strives to be the operation of choice in the community it serves, provide a broad spectrum of skilled nursing, senior living and other ancillary services. As of December 31, 2021, we offered skilled nursing, senior living and rehabilitative care services through 245 skilled nursing and senior living facilities. Of the 245 facilities, we operated 176 facilities under long-term lease arrangements and have options to purchase 11 of those 176 facilities. Our real estate portfolio includes 100 owned real estate properties, which included 69 facilities operated and managed by us, 32 senior living operations leased to and operated by The Pennant Group, Inc., or Pennant, as part of the spin-off transaction that occurred in October 2019 (Spin-Off), and the Service Center location. Of the 32 real estate operations leased to Pennant, two senior living operations are located on the same real estate properties as skilled nursing facilities that we own and operate.
Ensign is a holding company with no direct operating assets, employees or revenues. Our operating subsidiaries are operated by separate, independent entities, each of which has its own management, employees and assets. In addition, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to collectively as the Service Center, provide centralized accounting, payroll, human resources, information technology, legal, risk management and other centralized services to the other operating subsidiaries through contractual relationships with such subsidiaries. We also have a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (or the Captive Insurance) that provides some claims-made coverage to our operating subsidiaries for general and professional liability, as well as coverage for certain workers’ compensation insurance liabilities and our captive real estate trust owns and operates our real estate portfolio. Our captive real estate investment trust (Standard Bearer REIT) owns and manages our real estate business. References herein to the consolidated “Company” and “its” assets and activities, as well as the use of the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms in this Annual Report, are not meant to imply, nor should they be construed as meaning, that The Ensign Group, Inc. has direct operating assets, employees or revenue, or that any of the subsidiaries are operated by The Ensign Group.
Recent Activities
Captive Real Estate Investment Trust - On January 1, 2022, we completed our plan to form Standard Bearer REIT. Standard Bearer REIT is a holding company with subsidiaries that own most of our real estate portfolio. We expect the REIT structure will allow us to better demonstrate the growing value of our owned real estate and provides us with an efficient vehicle for future acquisitions of properties that could be operated by Ensign affiliates or other third parties. We believe this structure will give us new pathways to growth with transactions we would not have considered in the past. Standard Bearer REIT intends to qualify and elects to be taxed as a REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2022.
The real estate portfolio in Standard Bearer REIT consists of selected 93 of our 100 owned real estate properties. Of the 93 owned real estate properties in Standard Bearer REIT, 65 facilities are operated by Ensign operating subsidiaries and 30 are leased to and operated by Pennant. Of the 30 real estate operations leased to Pennant, two senior living operations are located on the same real estate properties as skilled nursing facilities that we own and operate.
The fair value of Standard Bearer REIT's real estate portfolio is approximately $1.0 billion. The fair value was determined by a third party independent valuation specialist and incorporated each property's rental income, capitalization rate, rental yield rate and discount rate as appropriate.
On January 1, 2022, as part of the formation of Standard Bearer REIT, certain of our operating subsidiaries and the 65 Standard Bearer REIT subsidiaries entered into five "triple-net" master lease agreements (collectively, the Standard Bearer REIT Master Leases). The lease period ranges from 15 to 19 years with three five-year renewal option beyond the initial term, on the same terms and conditions. The rent structure under the Standard Bearer REIT Master Leases includes a fixed component, subject to annual escalation equal to the lesser of (1) the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (but not less than zero) or (2) 2.5%. In addition to rent, the operating subsidiaries are required to pay the following: (1) all impositions and taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); (2) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (4) all facility maintenance and repair costs; and (5) all fees in connection with any licenses or authorizations necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. Total annual rental income under the Standard Bearer REIT Master Lease is approximately $54.0 million. In addition, as we expand our real estate portfolio through our acquisition strategy, we anticipate that the acquired real estate will be included in Standard Bearer REIT.
Standard Bearer REIT has no employees. Personnel and service provided to Standard Bearer REIT by the Service Center are pursuant to the management agreement between Standard Bearer REIT and the Service Center. The management agreement provides for a base management fee and an incentive management fee, payable in cash, among other terms. The base management fee for each applicable period is equal to 5% of the total revenue of Standard Bearer REIT. The incentive management fee is equal to 5% of funds from operations (FFO) and is capped at 1% of total revenue. In addition, operating expenses incurred by the Service Center on Standard Bearer REIT's behalf, which includes the cost of legal, tax, consulting, accounting and other similar services rendered by the Service Center, its advisers or other third parties, are reimbursed by Standard Bearer REIT.
Standard Bearer REIT will obtain its funding through various sources including operating cash flows, access to debt arrangements and intercompany loans. The intercompany debt arrangements include mortgage loans and a credit revolver between the Ensign Group, Inc., the real estate properties and Standard Bearer REIT and will fund acquisitions and working capital needs. The interest rate under the credit revolver is a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% per annum or LIBOR plus a margin range from 1.50% to 2.50% per annum. The intercompany mortgage loan amount is $93.0 million. There
is currently no outstanding debt under the intercompany credit revolver. In addition, as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) mortgage loans and promissory notes are entered into by our real estate properties, these debts in the aggregate amount of $160.0 million are included in Standard Bearer REIT.
Coronavirus Update - We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and are taking proactive steps designed to protect the health and safety of our residents and employees and to maintain business continuity. As the vaccines became accessible in all 50 states, we began to see a significant decline in COVID-19 cases in our affiliated operations as we worked diligently to vaccinate all of our willing residents and staff. While we saw declining COVID-19 cases during the summer of 2021 as a result of vaccination efforts, introductions of variants have caused spikes in the number of COVID cases. Our primary focus throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has remained ensuring the health and safety of our patients, residents, employees, and their respective families. We continue to implement measures necessary to provide the safest possible environment within our sites of service, taking into consideration the vulnerable nature of our patients and the unique exposure risks of our staff.
During the year, combined Same Facilities and Transitioning Facilities occupancy declined by 0.4% and skilled mix increased by 0.6% compared to 2020. In 2020, our occupancy, which was at its highest point prior to the pandemic, started to decline in mid-February and continued to decrease to its lowest point in December 2020. As the vaccine distribution commenced and infection rates began to decline, our occupancy rates started to recover in the first quarter of 2021 and continued throughout 2021. The improvements in occupancy were due to our operations developing innovative approaches to confront the occupancy declines, including strategic partnerships with upstream and downstream continuum partners and increasing clinical competencies to treat high-acuity patients, including those that are COVID-19 positive. Additionally, we have seen increases in hospital volumes for surgeries. Some operations added COVID-19 wings, while others became COVID-19 dedicated facilities, enabling an important offloading of strained hospital capacity. Even with COVID-19 demands waning, the partnerships developed during the pandemic will continue to benefit us into the future.
More specifically as a result of our local, one operation at a time approach, our Same Facilities and Transitioning Facilities occupancy rebounded by 3.1% and 4.8%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As the Delta variant and the recent Omicron variant become the dominant form of COVID-19 in the U.S. and elsewhere, many states and areas in which our communities are located are experiencing new COVID-19 caseloads. The rise of COVID-19 cases in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through early 2022 has slowed down our census recoveries. Our monthly occupancy for Same Facilities and Transitioning Facilities grew 85 basis points from July 2021 to December 2021 after growth had accelerated sequentially by 337 basis points from December 2020 to June 2021. Occupancy at the end of 2021 has recovered 53.8% from the lowest point in 2020. We expect sequential monthly occupancy to again grow starting in the first quarter of 2022, but at a slightly more moderated rate. By strengthening existing partnerships, creating new partnerships and most importantly, demonstrating clinical capabilities and favorable outcomes, our census has continued to stabilize. We believe our operations are primed to rebuild occupancies and continue to gain additional market share as a result of relationships with acute care providers and other health care partners.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received approximately $11.6 million in provider relief fund distributions (Provider Relief Fund) from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act) from the federal government. To date, we have returned all Provider Relief Funds that we received. Further, in March 2021, we repaid the remaining $102.0 million of Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program funds. On September 10, 2021, HHS made an additional round of $17.0 billion in Provider Relief Fund available to support healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. We have not received any funding related to the additional round of Provider Relief Fund distributions.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received state relief funding of $70.5 million and $51.9 million and recognized $75.2 million and $45.4 million, respectively, as revenue. Our unapplied state funding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively. See Note 3, COVID-19 Update in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due by December 31, 2022. We recorded $48.3 million of deferred payments of social security taxes as a liability in 2020, of which $24.2 million was paid out in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the remaining liabilities will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Until the COVID-19 pandemic has been resolved as a public health crisis, it has the potential to cause further and more severe disruption of the global and national economies. Despite these challenges, we believe we are well-positioned to operate effectively in the current environment. Our forecasted metrics may be modified as the pace of the recovery in our volumes and costs of services and supplies become clearer over the coming months.
We continue to focus on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through utilizing the infrastructure of our local operational approach. Each location is partnering with its local leaders and community outreach to ensure the operations are well equipped to deliver quality care. Consistent with previous hurdles, our local leaders are adjusting their operation to meet the clinical and financial challenges, including utilizing the expertise of our Service Center resources to implement best practices.
HUD Mortgage Loans - During the year ended December 31, 2021, four of our subsidiaries entered into HUD mortgage loans in the aggregate amount of approximately $45.0 million. The mortgage loans are insured with HUD, which subjects these subsidiaries to HUD oversight and periodic inspections. Loan proceeds were used to fund acquisitions, to renovate and upgrade existing and future facilities, to cover working capital needs and for other business purposes.
Common Stock Repurchase Program - On October 21, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our common stock under the program for a period of approximately 12 months that starts on October 29, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $10.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $9.9 million. This repurchase program expired upon the repurchase of the full authorized amount under the plan. On February 9, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our common stock under the program for a period of approximately 12 months that starts on February 10, 2022.
Key Performance Indicators
We manage the fiscal aspects of our business by monitoring key performance indicators that affect our financial performance. Revenue associated with these metrics is generated based on contractually agreed-upon amounts or rate, excluding the estimates of variable consideration under the revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. These indicators and their definitions include the following:
Skilled Services
•Routine revenue - Routine revenue is generated by the contracted daily rate charged for all contractually inclusive skilled nursing services. The inclusion of therapy and other ancillary treatments varies by payor source and by contract. Services provided outside of the routine contractual agreement are recorded separately as ancillary revenue, including Medicare Part B therapy services, and are not included in the routine revenue definition.
•Skilled revenue - The amount of routine revenue generated from patients in the skilled nursing facilities who are receiving higher levels of care under Medicare, managed care, Medicaid, or other skilled reimbursement programs. The other skilled patients who are included in this population represent very high acuity patients who are receiving high levels of nursing and ancillary services which are reimbursed by payors other than Medicare or managed care. Skilled revenue excludes any revenue generated from our senior living services.
•Skilled mix - The amount of our skilled revenue as a percentage of our total skilled nursing routine revenue. Skilled mix (in days) represents the number of days our Medicare, managed care, or other skilled patients are receiving skilled nursing services at the skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients from all payor sources are receiving skilled nursing services at the skilled nursing facilities for any given period.
•Average daily rates - The routine revenue by payor source for a period at the skilled nursing facilities divided by actual patient days for that revenue source for that given period. These rates exclude additional state relief funding, which includes payments we recognized as part of The Family First Coronavirus Response Act.
•Occupancy percentage (operational beds) - The total number of patients occupying a bed in a skilled nursing facility as a percentage of the beds in a facility which are available for occupancy during the measurement period.
•Number of facilities and operational beds - The total number of skilled nursing facilities that we own or operate and the total number of operational beds associated with these facilities.
Skilled Mix - Like most skilled nursing providers, we measure both patient days and revenue by payor. Medicare, managed care and other skilled patients, whom we refer to as high acuity patients, typically require a higher level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care. Accordingly, Medicare and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors. In most states, Medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest of all payor types. Changes in the payor mix can significantly affect our revenue and profitability.
The following table summarizes our overall skilled mix from our skilled nursing services for the periods indicated as a percentage of our total skilled nursing routine revenue and as a percentage of total skilled nursing patient days:
Year Ended December 31,
Skilled Mix: 2021 2020
Days 31.7 % 31.7 %
Revenue 52.3 % 53.1 %
Occupancy - We define occupancy derived from our skilled services as the ratio of actual patient days (one patient day equals one patient occupying one bed for one day) during any measurement period to the number of beds in facilities which are available for occupancy during the measurement period. The number of licensed beds in a skilled nursing facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total official licensed bed capacity. This sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes, such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and/or operational efficiencies in a facility. In some cases, three- and four-bed wards have been reduced to two-bed rooms for resident comfort, and larger wards have been reduced to conform to changes in Medicare requirements. These beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service. We believe that reporting occupancy based on operational beds is consistent with industry practices and provides a more useful measure of actual occupancy performance from period to period.
The following table summarizes our overall occupancy statistics for skilled nursing operations for the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31,
Occupancy for skilled services: 2021 2020
Operational beds at end of period 25,032 23,172
Available patient days 8,895,949 8,392,147
Actual patient days 6,478,810 6,171,198
Occupancy percentage (based on operational beds) 72.8 % 73.5 %
Segments
We have two reportable segments: (1) skilled services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation therapy services and (2) real estate, which is comprised of properties owned by us and leased to skilled nursing and assisted living operations, including our own operating subsidiaries and third party operators, and are subject to triple-net long-term leases.
We also reported an “all other” category that includes operating results from our senior living operations, mobile diagnostics, transportation and other ancillary operations. Our senior living, mobile diagnostics, transportation and other ancillary operations businesses are neither significant individually, nor in aggregate and therefore do not constitute a reportable segment. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information at the operating segment level.
Revenue Sources
Skilled Services
Within our skilled nursing operations, we generate revenue from Medicaid, private pay, managed care and Medicare payors. We believe that our skilled mix, which we define as the number of days Medicare, managed care and other skilled patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing operations divided by the total number of days patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing operations, from all payor sources (less days from senior living services) for any given period, is an important indicator of our success in attracting high-acuity patients because it represents the percentage of our patients who are reimbursed by Medicare, managed care and other skilled payors, for whom we receive higher reimbursement rates.
We are participating in supplemental payment programs in various states that provide supplemental Medicaid payments for skilled nursing facilities that are licensed to non-state government-owned entities such as city and county hospital districts. Several of our operating subsidiaries entered into transactions with several such hospital districts providing for the transfer of
the licenses for those skilled nursing facilities to the hospital districts. Each affected operating subsidiary agreement between the hospital district and our subsidiary is terminable by either party to fully restore the prior license status.
Real Estate
We generate rental revenue primarily by leasing post-acute care properties we acquired to healthcare operators under triple-net lease arrangements, whereby the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property, including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs, subject to certain exceptions. As of December 31, 2021, our real estate portfolio comprised of 100 real estate properties. Of these properties, 69 are leased to affiliated skilled nursing facilities wholly owned and managed by us, 32 are leased to senior living operations wholly owned and managed by Pennant and our Service Center property, which is leased to our Service Center and numerous third parties for commercial office space. Of the 32 real estate operations leased to Pennant, two senior living operations are located on the same real estate properties as skilled nursing facilities that the Company owns and operates. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated rental revenues of $65.5 million, of which $49.6 million was derived from affiliated wholly owned healthcare operators, and therefore eliminated in consolidation.
Other
Within our senior living operations, we generate revenue primarily from private pay sources, with a portion earned from Medicaid payors or through other state-specific programs. In addition, we hold majority membership interests in our other ancillary operations. Payment for these services varies and is based upon the service provided. The payment is adjusted for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk.
Primary Components of Expense
Cost of Services (exclusive of rent and depreciation and amortization shown separately). Our cost of services represents the costs of operating our operating subsidiaries, which primarily consists of payroll and related benefits, supplies, purchased services, and ancillary expenses such as the cost of pharmacy and therapy services provided to patients. Cost of services also includes the cost of general and professional liability insurance, rent expenses related to leasing our operational facilities that are not included in facility rent - cost of services, and other general cost of services with respect to our operations.
Facility Rent - Cost of Services. Rent - cost of services consists solely of base minimum rent amounts payable under lease agreements to third-party real estate owners. Our operating subsidiaries lease and operate but do not own the underlying real estate and these amounts do not include taxes, insurance, impounds, capital reserves or other charges payable under the applicable lease agreements. Expenses related to leasing our operations other than rent are included in cost of services.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for our Service Center personnel, including training and other operational support. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees (including accounting and legal fees), costs relating to our information systems and stock-based compensation related to our Service Center employees.
Depreciation and Amortization. Property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. The following is a summary of the depreciable lives of our depreciable assets:
Buildings and improvements Minimum of three years to a maximum of 57 years, generally 45 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life, generally 5 to 15 years
Furniture and equipment 3 to 10 years
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant
judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Variable consideration within revenue recognition - Revenue recognized from healthcare services are adjusted for estimates of variable consideration to arrive at the transaction price. We determine the transaction price based on contractually agreed-upon amounts or rates, adjusted for estimates of variable consideration. We use the expected value method in determining the variable component that should be used to arrive at the transaction price, using contractual agreements and historical reimbursement experience within each payor type. The amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. If actual amounts of consideration ultimately received differ from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net service revenue in the period such variances become known.
Self-insurance for general and professional liability - The self-insured retention and deductible limits for general and professional liability for all states are self-insured through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the Captive Insurance), the related assets and liabilities of which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our general and professional liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $69.7 million and $60.9 million, respectively.
Our policy is to accrue amounts equal to the actuarially estimated costs to settle open claims of insureds, as well as an estimate of the cost of insured claims that have been incurred but not reported. We develop information about the size of the ultimate claims based on historical experience, current industry information and actuarial analysis, and evaluate the estimates for claim loss exposure on a quarterly basis. We use actuarial valuations to estimate the liability based on historical experience and industry information.
Results of Operations
We believe we exist to dignify and transform post-acute care. We set out a strategy to achieve our goal of ensuring our patients are receiving the best possible care through our ability to acquire, integrate and improve our operations. Our results serve as a strong indicator that our strategy is working and our transformation is underway. As vaccines became available in the communities we serve, we began to see a recovery in our census during the first quarter of 2021, which has improved throughout 2021. Despite the emergence of COVID-19 variants in late 2021, which has led to spikes in COVID-19 caseloads and slowed down our census recoveries starting in the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we continue to experience healthy growth in both revenue and operational earnings.
Our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 continued to be impacted by COVID-19. The Emergency Waivers issued by CMS, including a waiver of the requirement to have a three-day stay in a hospital to get Medicare coverage of a skilled nursing stay as well as the authorization of renewed skilled nursing facility coverage without having to start a new benefit period for certain beneficiaries who recently exhausted their skilled nursing facility benefits, continued into 2021 and remain in effect at the beginning of 2022. In addition, we continued to receive state relief funding in selected states, which has been designed to enhance reimbursement to provide additional funding to cover COVID-19 related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded state relief revenue of $75.2 million, respectively, which directly offset against COVID-19 related expenses we incurred in those states. See Recent Activities for further information.
Since 2016, our total revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 82.8%, representing a 12.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) while our diluted GAAP earning per share (EPS) from continued operations grew by $2.86 from 2016 to $3.42, representing a 35.2% CAGR. Over the past year, we have continued to make progress on targeted initiatives, including our foundational structure of local operations that are the centers of excellence in the communities they serve. As part of this focus, we have been able to expand our relationships with doctors, hospitals and managed care plans. Revenue from our skilled services collectively increased by 10.3%. We have also strengthened our collection process and identified non-clinical areas where we can manage spending. These operational fundamentals coupled with the reduction of interest expense due to the deferral of payroll tax payments and cash generated from strong fiscal year performance.

The following discussion includes references to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Funds from Operations (FFO) which are non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.
We believe the presentation of certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements regarding our results of operations because:
•they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and
•they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results.
We use the Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
•as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis;
•to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business;
•to assess the value of a potential acquisition;
•to assess the value of a transformed operation's performance;
•to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies; and
•to compare our operating performance to that of our competitors.
We use certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures to compare the operating performance of each operation. These measures are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, which may vary from period-to-period depending upon various factors, including the method used to finance operations, the amount of debt that we have incurred, whether an operation is owned or leased, the date of acquisition of a facility or business, and the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates.
We also establish compensation programs and bonuses for our leaders that are partially based upon the achievement of Adjusted EBITDAR targets.
Despite the importance of these measures in analyzing our underlying business, designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures have no standardized meaning defined by GAAP. Therefore, certain of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•they do not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•they do not reflect the net interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;
•they do not reflect rent expenses, which are necessary to operate our leased operations, in the case of Adjusted EBITDAR;
•they do not reflect any income tax payments we may be required to make;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures.
We compensate for these limitations by using them only to supplement net income on a basis prepared in accordance with GAAP in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.
Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ Non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. We strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of income from operations to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the table below, along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document.
We use the following Non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key valuation and operating performance measures:
PERFORMANCE MEASURES:
EBITDA
We believe EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base (depreciation and amortization expense) from our operating results.
We calculate EBITDA as net income, adjusted for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest, before (a) interest expense, net, (b) provision for income taxes, and (c) depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA
We adjust EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with EBITDA and GAAP net income attributable to The Ensign Group, Inc., is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for non-core business items, which for the reported periods includes, to the extent applicable:
•stock-based compensation expense;
•costs incurred related to real estate due diligence;
•business interruption gain;
•results related to operations not at full capacity;
•gain on sale of assets;
•acquisition related costs; and
•costs incurred related to new systems implementation.
Funds from Operations (FFO)
We consider FFO to be a useful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our real estate segment. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs, which excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. We define (in accordance with the definition used by NAREIT) FFO to consist of real estate segment income, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains or losses from sales of real estate, insurance recoveries related to real estate and impairment of depreciable real estate assets.
VALUATION MEASURE:
Adjusted EBITDAR
We use Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the value of prospective acquisitions. It is also a commonly used measure by our management, research analysts and investors, to compare the enterprise value of different companies in the healthcare industry, without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements. Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure that is not specified in GAAP. This measure is not displayed as a performance measure as it excludes rent expense, which is a normal and recurring operating expense.
The adjustments made and previously described in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA are also made when computing Adjusted EBITDAR. We calculate Adjusted EBITDAR by excluding rent-cost of services from Adjusted EBITDA.
We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDAR allows the investor to compare operational results of companies who have operating and capital leases. A significant portion of capital lease expenditures are recorded in interest, whereas operating lease expenditures are recorded in rent expense.

Our total revenue increased $224.9 million, or 9.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue from same facility and transitioning operations was primarily driven by the increase in skilled service revenue per patient day, along with the impact of acquisitions. Total revenue from operations acquired on or subsequent to January 1, 2020 increased our consolidated revenue by $126.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. In addition, we recorded $75.2 million of state relief revenue during the year ended in 2021 compared to $45.4 million in 2020, which correlated directly to the additional COVID-19 related expenses incurred. All state relief revenue is included in Medicaid revenue.

*Campus represents a facility that offers both skilled nursing and senior living services. Revenue and expenses related to skilled nursing and senior living services have been allocated and recorded in the respective operating segment. In the first half of 2021, we converted two campuses into two skilled nursing facilities.
(1)Same Facility results represent all facilities purchased prior to January 1, 2018.
(2)Transitioning Facility results represent all facilities purchased from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019.
(3)Recently Acquired Facility (Acquisitions) results represent all facilities purchased on or subsequent to January 1, 2020.
Skilled services revenue increased $235.1 million, or 10.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary changes were from increases in managed care revenue of $89.6 million or 24.4%, Medicaid custodial revenue of $120.1 million or 13.5%, other skilled revenue of $22.9 million or 15.3%, and private and other payors revenue increased by $2.7 million, or 1.7%. Medicare revenue remained consistent from the prior year.
The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our skilled services operations. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our census started in mid-February 2020 and continued into the first quarter of 2021. Census began to recover in the second quarter of 2021 and continued throughout 2021. Our consolidated occupancy decreased by 0.7%, which includes operations acquired at lower occupancy, compared to the same period in the prior year. Consolidated patient days increased due to transitioning and newly acquired operations. The decline in consolidated occupancy was offset by the increase in average daily revenue rates and skilled days due to a shift in higher acuity. As COVID-19 cases decline, we have experienced a recovery in our census, which includes the return of our long-term care patients. This has a direct impact on our skilled days percentage as our long-term care patient days continue to climb and make up a higher percentage of the total patient days. Our ancillary revenue services also increased by 37.9%. In addition, we recorded $75.2 million of state relief revenue during the year ended in 2021 compared to $45.4 million in 2020, which correlated directly to the additional COVID-19 related expenses incurred.
Revenue in our Same Facilities increased $80.0 million, or 4.2% due to higher average daily revenue rates due to a shift toward higher acuity patients, offset by the decrease in occupancy of 0.5%, which primarily declined in the first three months in 2021 and has steadily increased since April 2021. The decline in our occupancy is mainly in our non-skilled patient days, which was offset by the shift toward higher acuity patients. Total revenue for Same Facilities included $58.4 million and $37.2 million of Medicaid revenue related to state relief funding for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Managed care revenue increased by $63.0 million or 19.8%, driven by increases in managed care days as our partnership with various managed care organizations, hospitals and the local communities strengthened.
Revenue generated by our Transitioning Facilities increased $30.7 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to increases in our daily rate and skilled mix days compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, demonstrating our ability to transition these healthcare operations that were acquired two and three years ago. In addition, we experienced a shift toward higher acuity patients as our skilled days increased by 10.1%.
Skilled services revenue generated by facilities purchased on or subsequent to January 1, 2020 (Recently Acquired Facilities) increased by approximately $124.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We acquired 17 operations between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 across five states.
In the future, if we acquire additional facilities that are underperforming and need to be turned around or invest in start-up operations, we expect to see lower occupancy rates and skilled mix and these metrics are expected to vary from period to period based upon the maturity of the facilities within our portfolio. Historically, we have generally experienced lower occupancy rates and lower skilled mix at Recently Acquired Facilities and therefore, we anticipate generally lower overall occupancy during years of growth.
The following table reflects the change in skilled nursing average daily revenue rates by payor source, excluding services that are not covered by the daily rate (1):

(1) These rates exclude additional Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) we recognized and include sequestration reversal of 2%.
Our Medicare daily rates at Same Facilities and Transitioning Facilities increased by 3.7% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is attributable to the 1.2% net market basket increase that became effective in October 2021 coupled with our continued shift towards higher acuity patients. Included in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 is the twelve-month impact of the temporary suspension of the 2% Medicare sequestration, which started on May 1, 2020 and was extended through April 1, 2022. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 included eight months of impact from the temporary suspension of the 2% Medicare sequestration.
Our average Medicaid rates increased 4.1% due to state reimbursement increases and our participation in supplemental Medicaid payment programs and quality improvement programs in various states. Medicaid rates exclude the amount of state relief revenue we recorded.
Payor Sources as a Percentage of Skilled Nursing Services. We use our skilled mix as a measure of the quality of reimbursements we receive at our affiliated skilled nursing facilities over various periods.

Rental revenue. Our rental revenue, including revenue generated from our affiliated facilities, increased by $4.3 million, or 7.0% to $65.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to acquisitions and CPI increases.
FFO. Our FFO increased $6.2 million, or 12.5% to $55.7 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in FFO is primarily related to the increase in rental revenue and the decrease in interest expense.
All Other Service Revenue
Our other revenue decreased by $11.0 million, or 11.1% to $88.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Other revenue for 2021 includes senior living revenue of $48.4 million and revenue from other ancillary services of $39.8 million. The decrease in revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19, which negatively impacted services in our other ancillary services.
Consolidated Financial Expenses
Rent - cost of services. Our rent - cost of services as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 0.1% to 5.3%, primarily due to the growth in revenue outpacing the increase in rent expense.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased $22.0 million or 17.0%, to $151.8 million. This increase was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits due to enhanced performance and growth, as well as expenses incurred related to the formation of Standard Bearer REIT of $5.7 million. General and administrative expense increased by 0.4% to 5.8%, as a percentage of revenue.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.4 million, or 2.6%, to $56.0 million. This increase was primarily related to the additional depreciation and amortization incurred as a result of our newly acquired operations. Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.2%, to 2.1%, as a percentage of revenue.
Other expense, net. Other expense, net as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.1%, to 0.1%. Other expense primarily includes interest expense related to borrowings under mortgage debt. As there was no outstanding debt under the Credit Facility, interest expense decreased.
Provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 21.3% for the same period in 2020. The effective tax rate for both periods is driven by the impact of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by non-deductible expenses. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been derived from our cash flows from operations and long-term debt secured by our real property and our Credit Facility. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2021 is impacted by cash generated from strong operational performance and the repayment of Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program funds and deferral of the employer portion of social security taxes.
Historically, we have primarily financed the majority of our acquisitions through the financing of our operating subsidiaries through mortgages, our Credit Facility, and cash generated from operations. Cash paid to fund acquisitions was $104.1 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total capital expenditures for property and equipment were $69.6 million and $50.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We currently have approximately $70.0 million budgeted for renovation projects for 2022. We believe our current cash balances, our cash flow from operations and the amounts available under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our operating needs for at least the next 12 months.
We may, in the future, seek to raise additional capital to fund growth, capital renovations, operations and other business activities, but such additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.
Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 consisted of bank term deposits, money market funds and U.S. Treasury bill related investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we held debt security investments of approximately $50.3 million, which were split between AA, A and BBB rated securities. We believe our debt security investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment.
As mentioned above, our primary sources of cash is from our ongoing operations. Our positive cash flows have supported our business and have allowed us to pay regular dividends to our stockholders. We currently anticipate that existing cash and total investments as of December 31, 2021, along with projected operating cash flows and available financing, will support our normal business operations for the foreseeable future.
On October 21, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our common stock under the program for a period of approximately 12 months that starts on October 29, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $10.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $9.9 million. This repurchase program expired upon the repurchase of the full authorized amount under the plan. On February 9, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our common stock under the program for a period of approximately 12 months that starts on February 10, 2022. The share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Under these programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 262,201 $ 236,562
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
The $97.7 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, was primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net income. Changes in working capital was driven by a payment on the deferred employer portion of social security taxes in December 2021, timing of accounts receivable collections and payment of income taxes and expenses.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment activities, insurance proceeds and cash used for acquisitions.
The $115.2 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, was primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures of $93.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively, which are partially offset by an increase in cash from insurance proceeds of $6.1 million.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, repayment of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program funds and sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
The $61.2 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, was primarily due to the proceeds and repayment of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program funds offset by net borrowing activity.
A discussion of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 is included in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2021.

Credit Facility with a Lending Consortium Arranged by Truist
We maintain the Credit Facility with a lending consortium arranged by Truist, which includes a revolving line of credit of up to $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is October 1, 2024. The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% per annum or LIBOR plus a margin range from 1.50% to 2.50% per annum, based on the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the agreement). In addition, we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments that ranges from 0.25% to 0.45% per annum, depending on the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $6.7 million on the Credit Facility of borrowing capacity pledged as collateral to secure outstanding letters of credit, which is a reduction of $0.9 million from 2020.
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we amended our Credit Facility to include Standard Bearer REIT as a co-borrower. All existing terms and conditions remained the same. As of December 31, 2021, and February 4, 2022, there was no outstanding debt under the Credit Facility.
Mortgage Loans and Promissory Notes
During the year ended December 31, 2021, four of our subsidiaries entered into HUD mortgage loans in the aggregate amount of $45.0 million. As a result, 23 of our subsidiaries have mortgage loans insured with HUD for an aggregate amount of $156.6 million, as of December 31, 2021, which subjects these subsidiaries to HUD oversight and periodic inspections. The mortgage loans bear effective interest rates range of 3.1% to 4.2%, including fixed interest rates range of 2.4% to 3.3% per annum. Amounts borrowed under the mortgage loans may be prepaid, subject to prepayment fees of the principal balance on the date of prepayment. For the majority of the loans, the prepayment fee is 10% during the first three years and is reduced by 3% in the fourth year of the loan, and reduced by 1% per year for years five through ten of the loan. There is no prepayment penalty after year ten. The term of the mortgage loans are 25 to 35 years.
In addition to the HUD mortgage loans above, we have two promissory notes. The notes bear fixed interest rates of 5.0% and 5.3% per annum and the term of the notes are ten months and 12 years, respectively. The 12-year note, which was used for an acquisition, is secured by the real property comprising the facility and the rent, issues and profits thereof, as well as all personal property used in the operation of the facility.
Operating Leases
During the fiscal year of 2021, 176 of our facilities are under long-term lease arrangements, of which 94 of the operations are under nine triple-net Master Leases and one stand-alone lease with CareTrust REIT, Inc. (CareTrust). The Master Leases consist of multiple leases, each with its own pool of properties, that have varying maturities and diversity in property geography. Under each master lease, our individual subsidiaries that operate those properties are the tenants and CareTrust's individual subsidiaries that own the properties subject to the Master Leases are the landlords. The rent structure under the Master Leases includes a fixed component, subject to annual escalation equal to the lesser of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (but not less than zero) or 2.5%. At our option, we can extend the Master Leases for two or three five-year renewal terms beyond the initial term, on the same terms and conditions. If we elect to renew the term of a Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Master Lease. Additionally, four of the 95 facilities leased from CareTrust include an option to purchase that we can exercise starting on December 1, 2024. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company added four operations and extended the term for one of the Master Leases for an additional 15 years. In the third quarter of 2021, we also added two operations and extended the term for one of the Master Leases for an additional 17 years. As a result, the total lease liabilities and right-of-use assets increased by $54.7 million and $63.4 million, respectively, to reflect the new lease obligations.
We also lease certain affiliated facilities and our administrative offices under non-cancelable operating leases, most of which have initial lease terms ranging from five to 20 years and is subject to annual escalation equal to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index with a stated cap percentage. In addition, we lease certain of our equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms ranging from three to five years. Most of these leases contain renewal options, certain of which involve rent increases.
Forty-three of our affiliated facilities, excluding the facilities that are operated under the Master Leases from CareTrust, are operated under eight separate master lease arrangements. Under these master leases, a breach at a single facility could subject one or more of the other affiliated facilities covered by the same master lease to the same default risk. Failure to comply with Medicare and Medicaid provider requirements is a default under several of our leases, master lease agreements and debt financing instruments. In addition, other potential defaults related to an individual facility may cause a default of an entire master lease portfolio and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding debt arrangements and other leases. With an indivisible lease, it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or economic terms of the lease without the consent of the landlord.
U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand
On May 31, 2018, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Department of Justice stating that it is investigating to determine whether we have violated the False Claims Act and/or the Anti-Kickback Statute with respect to the relationships between certain of our skilled nursing facilities and persons who served as medical directors, advisory board participants or other referral sources. The CID covered the period from October 3, 2013 through 2018, and was limited in scope to ten of our Southern California skilled nursing facilities. In October 2018, the Department of Justice made an additional request for information covering the period of January 1, 2011 through 2018, relating to the same topic. As a general matter, our operating entities maintain policies and procedures to promote compliance with the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, and other applicable regulatory requirements. We have fully cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice and promptly responded to its requests for information; in April 2020, we were advised that the U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene in any subsequent action based on or related to the subject matter of this investigation.
Inflation
We have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the Medicare program. We also derive revenue from state Medicaid and similar reimbursement programs. Payments under these programs generally provide for reimbursement levels that are adjusted for inflation annually based upon the state’s fiscal year for the Medicaid programs and in each October for the Medicare program. These adjustments may not continue in the future, and even if received, such adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in our costs for providing healthcare services.
Labor and supply expenses make up a substantial portion of our cost of services. Those expenses can be subject to increase in periods of rising inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace. To date, we have generally been able
to implement cost control measures or obtain increases in reimbursement sufficient to offset increases in these expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures.
