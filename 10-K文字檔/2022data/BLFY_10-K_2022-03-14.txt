ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section is intended to assist in the understanding of the financial performance of the Company and its subsidiary through a discussion of our financial condition as of December 31, 2021, and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear at the end of this report.
COVID Update
The COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on the Company’s business continue to lessen as the economy stabilizes, restrictions ease, and general market conditions improve. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s policies are anticipated to address the recent inflation concerns and reduce the amount of broad-based financial support for asset pricing. This change in policy is indicative of a return to a more normal policy environment and the departure from pandemic-era policies which may be subject to future changes, such as changes that may result from any new COVID-19 variants.
Business Strategy
The Company’s goal is to position ourselves to prosper in an evolving financial services landscape and enhance our position as one of the leading community banking institutions in our market. We intend to continue to provide a broad array of banking and other financial services to retail, commercial and small business customers while growing our presence in our markets and expanding our franchise. In recent years, we have focused on, and invested heavily in, our technology and infrastructure to improve our delivery channels and create competitive products and services, a strong workforce and an enhanced awareness of our banking brand in our market area.
As a result, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities available in our market by focusing on the following core strategies.
Repositioning our Business Mix: Focus on building commercial and small-business relationships. We focus on understanding our customers’ and potential customers’ financial needs and providing a wide variety of high-quality products and solutions through a collaborative approach that intends to create long-term relationships. Our goal is to continue to evolve from a traditional savings bank focusing on residential lending to a full-service commercial bank with an emphasis on providing products and services to commercial and small businesses in our market area. We believe pursuing this strategy will allow us to both grow and diversify our business mix while providing us with the best opportunities to drive strong financial returns. We intend to pursue these commercial relationships through the lending personnel that we have recruited and continue to recruit, who have the experience and relationships necessary to build this business as well as through cultural changes that have been made across the organization that emphasize our goal of pursuing this strategy. Further, our investment in technology is intended to facilitate the delivery of consumer and business solutions without the need for traditional sales channels.
Recently, we were approved by the SBA to provide loans under the 7(a) Loan Program, the SBA’s most common loan program. We believe providing 7(a) loans as well as traditional commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit will allow us to provide needed funding to our business communities, which will increase deposits. Often, these borrowers also keep deposits at their loan providers.
Growing our Business: Developing new customer relationships and deepening existing relationships. We seek to expand our market share in existing and contiguous markets by leveraging our distinctive brand and delivering high-quality solutions through a collaborative, relationship-based approach. Our relationship-based approach has enabled us to achieve disciplined organic growth, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe our support of small business and non-profit customers in obtaining funding beginning in April 2020 under the PPP demonstrates both our commitment and capacity to meet our customers’ needs. Although many of our PPP borrowers were introduced to our bank through this program, we have been able to successfully establish and maintain a significant number of these new client relationships. Building our customer relationships around low and no cost products is part of our relationship expansion strategy. Our “Blue” products, including Blue Axis Checking,
Blue Axis Connect, Blue Axis Savings, and Blue Carbon Business Checking are designed to be low cost to the consumer or business, while providing us with lower interest rate deposits. Our consumer deposit products are designed to be easy to open in person or online. Our commercial deposit products include many features without fees that would customarily be included.
Leverage technology to enhance customer experience and drive operating efficiencies. We have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver high-quality, innovative products and services to our customers. For example, we continue to enhance our mobile banking platform for both consumer and commercial customers. In addition, we have invested in our new commercial lending origination system and platform, and we intend to continue to improve our consumer lending origination platform. We are committed to continue investing in technology and data analytics. We believe these investments will differentiate us with our target customers, which will generate significant operating leverage as we grow.
Continuing to invest and optimize our facilities and expand our branch network through selective de novo branching. Recently, we have been enhancing and optimizing both our facilities and branch network. We have optimized our branch footprint though the utilization of a new forward-thinking branch model and intend to continue our strategy to broaden our existing branch network by expanding into new markets and broadening our geographic footprint. In 2021, we opened new branches in Chatham, Ridgewood, and Jersey City, continuing our strategy of operating in high density areas with vibrant commercial corridors and main streets. Additionally, we renovated two existing locations, modernizing their appearance and upgrading their functionalities. We also plan to continue to open additional new branches in desirable locations in attractive growth markets. New branches will feature modern design elements focused on open and efficient use of space.
Branch efficiency has been built into our locations. All branches currently employ new multifunction automated teller machines that are designed to be compatible with new services as they become available. Further, all branches utilize teller cash recycling machines to further enhance efficiency.
Pursue opportunistic acquisitions and partnerships. We intend to prudently pursue opportunities to acquire banks in our existing and contiguous markets that create attractive financial returns. Our focus will primarily be on franchises that enhance our funding profile, product capabilities or geographic density, while maintaining an acceptable risk profile. We believe the vital need to make increasingly significant technological investments has greatly amplified the importance of scale in banking. In addition, we believe that the current economic climate will increase the rate of consolidation in the banking industry. We will evaluate potential partnerships with FinTech companies or other fee income generating businesses that we believe would be additive to our business strategy and consistent with our desire to stay ahead of technological developments that we believe will continue to cause the banking industry to evolve.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain of our accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. The Company has identified the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy. This accounting policy and our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.
Executive Summary
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General. Net loss increased $4.8 million, to a net loss of $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily a result of the establishment of a $16.7 million valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets, an $11.2 million loss related to the withdrawal from the multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan, and a $9.0 million contribution of cash and common stock of the Company to the Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a $12.8 million valuation allowance as certain Bank property was reclassified to held for sale and subsequently written down to fair value and goodwill impairment of $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Income. Interest income decreased $5.6 million, or 9.0%, to $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to a decrease of $5.4 million in interest income from loans as the average balance of loans decreased $114.0 million to $1.27 billion and the average yield on loans decreased eight basis points to 3.82%. PPP fees recognized in interest income totaled $2.8 million and $605 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $9.5 million, or 41.9%, to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a decrease of $8.0 million in interest expense on deposits, coupled with a decrease of $1.5 million in interest expense on borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposit balances rose to $1.29 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 0.61% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.28 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 1.24% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Interest Income and Margin. For the year ended December 31, 2021 net interest income was $42.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million compared to $39.1 million for same period in 2020.
Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 10 basis points to 2.20% from 2.10% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on average interest earning assets decreased by 44 basis points, primarily due to higher average cash balances with minimal yield, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The yield on average loans decreased by eight basis points and the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased 55 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Provision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb probable and incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.
After an evaluation of these factors, the Company recorded a recovery of provision for loan losses of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The recovery for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a change in balances in portfolio segments with respectively higher applied loss rates and declining non-performing assets.
As the pandemic emerged in March of 2020, the Company increased its allowance for loan losses by $1.5 million to $16.0 million as of March 31, 2020. As the economic effects of the pandemic continued to unfold, the Company increased its allowance by another $1.3 million as of June 30, 2020 to $17.3 million, where it remained through September 30, 2020 despite loan balances declining due to increased loan payoffs driven by record-low interest rates. Subsequently, credit quality continued to stabilize, and by December 31, 2020, the Company had
reduced its allowance slightly, to $17.0 million. 2021 saw continued strengthening of credit quality, as seen in the declining delinquency rates and balances of non-performing loans. Total non-performing loans decreased by $873 million to $12.0 million at December 31, 2021 compared to to $12.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented an increase of $1.3 million from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven by the the $1.4 million write down of real estate owned (“REO”) in 2020. All REO properties were sold during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense decreased $2.5 million to $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by higher non-recurring expenses recognized in the prior period, related to a $12.8 million valuation allowance as certain Bank property was reclassified to held for sale and subsequently written down to fair value and a goodwill impairment of $15.5 million, partially offset by lower non-recurring expenses recognized in 2021 related to an $11.2 million loss related to the withdrawal from the multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan and a $9.0 million contribution of cash and common stock of the Company to the Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation. The increase of $3.1 million in data processing fees and the offsetting decrease of $4.0 million in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by the transition from the use of consultants for information technology services during the 2020 period to managed services during 2021.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $9.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the establishment of valuation allowances for the Company’s deferred tax assets. This resulted in an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of 36.0% and (20.0)%, respectively.
Analysis of Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
Average Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances have been calculated using daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are not material.
(1) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
(2) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Table
The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionally based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Total Assets. Total assets decreased $28.3 million to $1.91 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.94 billion at December 31, 2020. During 2021, the Company utilized its elevated cash position and liquidity raised in the public offering to continue optimizing its balance sheet through funding loans, investing in securities, offsetting maturing high cost time deposits, and prepaying borrowings from the FHLB.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $123.0 million to $193.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $316.4 million at December 31, 2020. The Company received $250.8 million in net proceeds from the stock offering during the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents from the stock offering was offset by security purchases, prepayment of FHLB borrowings and decreases in deposit balances.
Gross Loans. Gross loans held for investment increased $2.5 million, or 0.19%, to $1.281 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.279 billion at December 31, 2020. The most significant drivers were net increases in multifamily and non-residential loans. These increases exceeded net payoffs and amortization in residential one-to-four family and construction loans as well as the ongoing forgiveness programs within the commercial & industrial portfolio attributable to loans made pursuant to the PPP. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were $196.2 million in originations of multifamily loans partially offset by $108.4 million of payoffs and amortization, $32.2 million in originations of non-residential loans partially offset by $18.7 million of payoffs and amortization, and $44.2 million of originations in commercial & industrial (primarily PPP loans) more than offset by $76.7 million in payoffs/forgiveness and amortization. The decrease in one-to-four family loans was primarily driven by $166.1 million in payoffs and amortization, partially offset by $115.5 million of originations, including $89.5 million in whole loan purchases.
The following table presents loans at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 allocated by loan category:
The table below presents the balance of non-performing assets on the dates indicated:
(1) Excludes PPP loans 90 days past due and accruing totaling $116 thousand at December 31, 2021.
Securities Available-For-Sale. Securities available-for-sale increased $80.3 million, or 32.8%, to $324.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $244.6 million at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury and Agency bonds, and corporate bonds were executed as interest rates rose. No securities were sold during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Assets Held-For-Sale, at Fair Value. We had no assets-held-for-sale at December 31, 2021 due to a decrease of $5.3 million from the sale during the fourth quarter of 2021 of the premises held for sale. The fourth quarter 2021 sale resulted in a net loss on sale of $83 thousand.
Securities Held-To-Maturity. Securities held-to-maturity increased $16.3 million to $23.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $7.0 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is due to an expansion of the portfolio during 2021.
Real Estate Owned, Net. Real estate owned, net decreased $624 thousand due to the sale during the fourth quarter of 2021 of the premises held for sale. The sale resulted in a net loss on sale of $6 thousand. The Company had no real estate owned at December 31, 2021.
Other Assets. Other assets decreased $4.6 million, or 35.0%, to $8.6 million at December 31, 2021 from $13.2 million at December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily a result of the establishment of a $16.8 million valuation allowance on the Company’s full deferred tax assets. The establishment of the valuation allowance was driven by the Company’s three-year cumulative net loss.
Total Deposits. Total deposits decreased $109.1 million or 8.0% to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2020 as the Company executed its strategy and allowed high cost time deposits to mature. Time deposits decreased $243.6 million, or 34.0%, to $473.8 million with a weighted average rate of 0.58% at December 31, 2021 from $717.4 million with a weighted average rate of 1.55% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in time deposits was partially offset by an increase in checking, savings, and money market accounts. These accounts increased $134.5 million, or 21.1%, to $773.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $638.8 million at December 31, 2020. This shift resulted in the ratio of time deposits to total deposits decreasing from 52.9% at December 31, 2020 to 38.0% at December 31, 2021, and a decline in the blended cost of deposits to 0.57% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 1.20% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the totals of deposit accounts by account type, at the dates shown below:
Included within the NOW and demand account caption, as well as the Savings caption above are money market accounts with varying transactional limits.
Borrowings. The Company had $185.5 million of borrowings at December 31, 2021, compared to $329.4 million of borrowings at December 31, 2020. The Bank extinguished $111.4 million in borrowings from the FHLB during the year ended December 31, 2021, incurring a prepayment penalty of $2.2 million. Additionally, $32.5 million of borrowings matured during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Total Equity. Total shareholders’ equity increased by $223.9 million to $429.5 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $205.8 million at December 31, 2020 primarily due to the conversion and related stock offering on July 15, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities, borrowings from the FHLB and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our primary use of funds is for the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities.
Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies.
The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the NJDOBI and the FDIC. At December 31, 2021, the Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and was considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements” and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Bank has entered into derivative financial instruments to reduce risk associated with interest rate volatility by matching asset maturities and liability maturities. These derivatives had an aggregate notional amount of $109.0 million as of December 31, 2021. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $16.3 million and unused lines of credit of $52.8 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 totaled $304.7 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2021 was $134.4 million with FHLB. We also had a $30.0 million available line of credit with a correspondent bank and a $2.5 million available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2021.
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments that we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Management believes that our current sources of liquidity are more than sufficient to fulfill our obligations as of December 31, 2021 pursuant to off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations.
