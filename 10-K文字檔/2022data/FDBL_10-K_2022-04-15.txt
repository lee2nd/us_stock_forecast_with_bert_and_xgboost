ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the sections of this annual report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors” beginning at page 13 above and “Forward-Looking Statements” beginning at page 4 above.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Our cash as of December 31, 2021 was $253,523. As a result of our minimal amount of revenues and ongoing expenditures in pursuit of our business, we have incurred net losses since our inception. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2021 was $39,474,426. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net loss was $2,905,180.
Our operating revenues and expenses for our fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased to $6,629 as compared to $401,905 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the ending in 2020 of the contract to develop an app for a third party.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the December 31, 2020 were $2,838,516 and $2,176,760 respectively, an increase of 30.4%. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to costs associated with higher general and administrative expenses in 2021 primarily due to a higher staffing costs, higher software development costs due to the launch in July 2021 of FanPass v.2 with enhanced user features and the higher cost in 2021 in advertising, promotion and marketing of the FanPassLive app, partially offset by one time artists’ performance fees of $ 431,639 incurred with the initial launch of the Fan Pass app in July, 2020.
Net Loss
Our operating results have recognized net loss in the amount of $2,905,180 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a net loss of $4,125,363 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily related to a loss on settlement of derivatives in 2020 and a gain on change in fair value of derivatives in 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
Current liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $5,007,005 and $5,436,963 respectively, a decrease of $429,958. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in derivative liabilities by $ 1,196,700 attributable to the conversion to common stock of certain convertible debentures and promissory notes during 2021, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $481,509 and an increase in the liability for mandatorily redeemable Series C convertible Preferred stock of $387,562 .
We currently do not have sufficient capital to fund our needs for the next 12 months. We rely on financing from convertible debt, promissory notes, and sale of stock to fund our operations.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Cash used by operating activities
The Company used $2,303,244 in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a use of $492,080 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due to higher general and administrative expenses and higher software development costs to launch FanPassLive v.2 app in 2021.
Cash provided by financing activities
Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 generated cash of $2,504,065 as compared to generating $533,500 of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher cash provided from financing activities in the current year is primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of convertible Series D preferred stock of $1,860,000 (before finder’s fees thereon) and higher proceeds from the issuance of convertible Series C preferred stock, which was $594,650 in 2021 vs. $180,000 in 2020.
There was no significant impact on the Company’s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Series A:
The Series A Preferred Stock was authorized in 2014 and is convertible into nine (9) times the number of common stock outstanding at time of conversion until the closing of a Qualified Financing (Through June 30, 2021 “Qualified Financing” was defined as the sale and issuance of the Company’s equity securities that results in gross proceeds in excess of $2,500,000. Effective July 1, 2021 this was amended so that “Qualified Financing” is now defined as the sale and issuance of the Company’s equity securities that results in gross proceeds in excess of $10,000,000.). The number of shares of common stock issued on conversion of Series A preferred stock is based on the ratio of the number of shares of Series A preferred stock converted to the total number of shares of preferred stock outstanding at the date of conversion multiplied by nine (9) times the number of common stock outstanding at the date of conversion. After the qualified financing the conversion shares issuable shall be the original issue price of the Series A preferred stock divided by $0.002. The holders of Series A Preferred stock are entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends when and if declared at a rate of 6% per year. On all matters presented to the stockholders for action the holders of Series A Preferred stock shall be entitled to cast votes equal to the number of shares the holder would be entitled to if the Series A Preferred stock were converted at the date of record.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, 588 shares of Series A preferred stock were converted to common stock by two related parties who donated them to the Diocese of Monterey. In addition, 890 Series A shares were converted into 2,018,746 common shares by parties related to the two directors.

As compensation for bringing the artists to the FanPass platform, E Artists will receive 5% of net revenue attributable to the Fan Pass platform, initially for a period of 18 months. In addition, E Artists will receive Series A preferred stock such that when converted would be equal to 5% of the outstanding common stock. The number of Series A preferred shares was calculated at 118 shares valued at $135,617 based on the quoted trading price of the Company’s common stock of $0.0605 on the agreement date and 2,241,596 equivalent common shares. The Company recorded a prepaid expense of $135,617 and has amortized a total of $97,010 as sales and marketing expense for the period through June 30, 2021, which includes amortization of $44,793 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 (2020 $6,682). Concurrent with the issuance of the Series A Shares to E Artists, Robert Rositano, Jr., the Company’s CEO and Dean Rositano, the Company’s president, returned an aggregate of 118 Series A Preferred shares to the Company’s treasury.

Debt Restructure Agreement
On March 26, 2019 three officers forgave debt totaling $400,000 and a company controlled by two officers of the Company forgave debt totaling $600,000. The debt forgiveness is considered a capital transaction and therefore $1,000,000 was recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital for December 31, 2019.
On March 26, 2019, the Company entered into a Debt Restructuring Agreement with related parties Robert A. Rositano Jr., Dean Rositano , Frank Garcia , and Checkmate Mobile, Inc. and Alpha Capital Anstalt , Coventry Enterprises, LLC , Palladium Capital Advisors, LLC, EMA Financial, LLC, Michael Finkelstein, and Barbara R.

This reset provision provides for the issuance of additional shares above the initial 5,902,589 shares for no additional consideration as measured at each of the two reset dates.

Going Concern
At December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficiency, an accumulated deficit, and a stockholders’ deficit of $4,753,482, $39,474,482 and $4,753,482 respectively and incurred a net loss and cash used in operations of $2,905,180 and $2,303,244 respectively in 2021. We have generated minimal revenues and have incurred losses since inception. Accordingly, we will be dependent on future additional financing in order to seek other business opportunities in the online entertainment industry or new business opportunities. We are considered a development stage company in the online entertainment industry. As of December 31, 2021, there is no assurance that we will be able raise sufficient capital to sustain our operations. We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, fair value of consideration issued in business combinations, valuation of convertible debenture conversion options, derivative instruments, deferred income tax asset valuations, financial instrument valuations, share-based payments, other equity-based payments, and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met; valid contracts are identified with specific customers, performance obligations have been identified, price is determinable, price is allocated to performance obligations, and the Company has satisfied the performance obligations. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2021 Company derived revenue solely from subscription fees and merchandising sales from the Friendable and Fan Pass apps totaling $6,629, which were recognized when received. This compares with the year ended December 31, 2020 where the Company derived revenues primarily from the development of apps for a third party of $ 397,333 which were recognized upon completion of services and secondarily from subscription fees and merchandising sales from the Friendable and Fan Pass apps totaling $4,572 recognized when received.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows.
If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
Stock-based compensation
We record stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Based Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options. In 2019 the Company adapted ASU 2018-17 which expands the measurement requirements to non employees.
ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method in determining fair value. This model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the terms of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.
Financial Instruments
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value, as required by ASC 820, must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of accounts payable, convertible debentures and promissory note approximate fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that we are not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
We compute net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
