You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
Tecogen designs, manufactures, markets, and maintains high efficiency, ultra-clean cogeneration products. These include natural gas engine driven combined heat and power (CHP) systems, chillers and heat pumps for multi-family residential, commercial, recreational and industrial use. We are known for products that provide customers with substantial energy savings, resiliency from utility power outages and for significantly reducing a customer’s carbon footprint. Our products are sold with our patented Ultera® technology which nearly eliminates all criteria pollutants such as NOx and CO. Our systems are greater than 88% efficient compared to typical electrical grid efficiencies of 40% to 50%. As a result, our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are typically half that of the electrical grid. Our systems generate electricity and hot water or in the case of our Tecochill product, both chilled water and hot water. These result in savings of energy related costs of up to 60% for our customers. Our products are expected to run on Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) as it is introduced into the US gas pipeline infrastructure.
Our products are sold directly to end-users by our in-house sales team and by established sales agents and representatives. We have agreements in place with distributors and sales representatives. Our existing customers include hospitals and nursing homes, colleges and universities, health clubs and spas, hotels and motels, office and retail buildings, food and beverage processors, multi-unit residential buildings, laundries, ice rinks, swimming pools, factories, municipal buildings, military installations and indoor growing facilities. To date we have shipped over 3,000 units, some of which have been operating for almost 35 years.
Although we may, from time to time, have one or a few customers who may represent more than 10% of our product revenue for a given year, we are not dependent on the recurrence of revenue from those customers. Our product revenue is such that customers may make a large purchase once and may not ever make a purchase again. Our equipment is built to last 30 or more years. Therefore, our product revenue model is not dependent on recurring sales transactions from the same customer. Our service revenue does lend itself to recurring revenue from particular customers, although we currently do not have any service revenue customers who make up more than 10% of our total revenues on an annual basis.
For the last two fiscal years, more than half of our revenue was generated from long-term maintenance and energy production contracts, which provides us with a predictable revenue stream, especially during the summer months. We have a slight surge of activity from May through September as our “chiller season” is in full swing. Our O&M service revenue which has grown from year to year since 2005, with our New York City/New Jersey and New England systems experiencing the majority of the growth, was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with the decreased installation service related revenue we achieved in the the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service margins are generally predictable as we service hundreds of long-term contracts with relatively low dollar, high volume sales.
TECOGEN INC.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our revenues were negatively impacted due to customer order delays or deferrals; service delays due to customer facility closures, in some cases for extended periods; and a reduction in our energy production segment revenue due to business closures and increased remote work and learning environments. The extent to which the coronavirus will continue to impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Our product revenue is derived from the sale of the various cogeneration modules, such as the InVerde, InVerde e+, the Tecopower, Ilios heat pumps, and Tecochill products. In 2019, we also reintroduced our TecoFrost refrigeration line. The sales cycle varies between 6 months to a year or more. Therefore, our product revenue can be difficult to predict and the expected margin can vary. In most cases we work with consulting engineers who specify our product in new and retrofit applications. We also work with building owners directly, in some limited cases offering a full turn-key installation.
Our cogeneration, heat pump, and chiller modules are built to order and revenue is recognized upon shipment. The lead time to build and deliver a unit depends on its customized configuration and is approximately 12 to 14 weeks for a chiller and 6 to 8 weeks for a cogeneration or heat pump from time of purchase order. As revenue is recognized upon shipment, our work-in-process is an important factor in understanding our financial condition in any given quarter.
Our operations are comprised of three business segments, as follows:
•Products segment - designs, manufactures and sells industrial and commercial cogeneration systems
•Services segment - provides O&M services for Tecogen supplied products at customer sites
•Energy Production segment - sells energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water, and cooling to our customers under long-term sales agreements
Recent Developments
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
On April 17, 2020, we obtained an unsecured loan in the principal amount of $1,874,200 from Webster Bank, NA ("Webster") under the Paycheck Protection Program adopted pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Recovery Act, as amended ("CARES Act"). On January 19, 2021 we received confirmation from Webster that the Paycheck Protection Program Loan in the original principal amount of $1,874,200 together with accrued interest of $13,659 was forgiven in full effective as of January 11, 2021. The loan forgiveness of $1,887,859 was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and is reported as a separate component of other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw Loan
On February 5, 2021, we obtained a Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw unsecured loan through Webster in the amount of $1,874,269 in connection with the Paycheck Protection Program pursuant to the CARES Act. On September 20, 2021, we received a letter dated September 13, 2021 from Webster confirming that the Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw Loan issued to us pursuant to the CARES Act in the original principal amount of $1,874,269 together with accrued interest of $11,386 was forgiven in full as of September 8, 2021. The loan forgiveness of $1,885,655 was accounted for as debt extinguishment and is reported as a separate component of other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Employee Retention Credit
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law providing numerous tax incentives and other stimulus measures, including an employee retention credit (“ERC”), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended and expanded the availability of the ERC. The ERC is available with respect to periods through October 1, 2021 and is equal to 70% of qualified wages (which includes employer qualified health plan expenses) paid to employees. In addition, the availability of the ERC was permitted to entities that received a Paycheck Protection Loan subject to certain conditions. During each quarter in 2021, a maximum of $10,000 in qualified wages for each employee is eligible for the ERC. Therefore, the maximum tax credit that can be claimed by an eligible employer in 2021 is $7,000 per employee per calendar quarter. Section 2301(c)(2)(B) of the CARES Act permits an employer to use an alternative quarter to calculate gross receipts and the employer may determine if the decline in gross receipts tests is met for a calendar quarter in 2021 by comparing its gross receipts for the immediately preceding calendar quarter with those for the corresponding calendar quarter in 2019. Accordingly, for the first quarter of 2021, we elected to use our gross receipts for the fourth calendar quarter of 2020 compared to our gross receipts for the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. As a result of our election to use an alternative quarter, we qualified for the ERC in the first, second and third quarters of 2021 because our gross receipts decreased by more than 20% from the first, second and third quarters of 2019. As a result of averaging 500 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, all wages paid to employees in the first,
TECOGEN INC.
second and third quarters of 2021 were eligible for the ERC. Wages used towards PPP loan forgiveness cannot be used as qualified wages for purposes of the ERC. During the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded ERC benefits of $1,276,021 shown in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and such claimed ERC's are disclosed within accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet.
Air Cooled Chiller Development
In Q3 2021 we began development on a hybrid air-cooled chiller. We recognized that there were many applications where the customer wanted an easy to install roof top chiller. Using the inverter design from our InVerde e+ cogeneration module, we came up with the novel concept of a hybrid chiller. This system can simultaneously take two inputs, one from the grid or a renewable energy source and one from our natural gas engine. This allows a customer to seek the optimum blend of operational cost savings and greenhouse gas benefits while providing added resiliency from two power sources. We expect to have a prototype operational by Q4 2022 and expect to see incremental revenue by early part of 2023. A provisional patent based on this concept has been filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
Energy Sales Agreements
On March 5, 2019, we transferred ownership of certain of our energy systems assets and related energy production contracts in a sale transaction in consideration for approximately $5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into two separate agreements to provide operational and maintenance services for the purchaser. Concurrently, we amended the terms of an agreement related to certain energy systems related assets and related energy production contracts, the ownership of which were transferred to the same purchaser in December 2018 in consideration of approximately $2 million, in order to conform and finalize the terms of the agreement to the March 2019 agreement. See Note 5. "Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In October 2021 the minimum guarantee with respect to one of the energy purchase agreements was modified by reducing the guaranteed minimum collections by $35,000 per year, the guaranteed minimum collection amount associated with one site that was sold by the customer.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These judgments, assumptions and estimates are made or applied within the context of accounting policies related to the nature of the transaction. Note 2. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Certain aspects of certain accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These aspects of these accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies. These policies may require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or employ an estimate where alternative estimates could have also been employed, and may involve estimates that are reasonably likely to change with the passage of time. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in "Item 1A," “Risk Factors" above.
Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies:
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied. This generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products, services and energy production. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services or energy to customers.
Determination of contract consideration allocatable to multiple performance obligations within a single contract requires employing stand-alone selling prices which may be based on observable selling prices, estimated selling prices or as a residual. We use an observable selling price to determine standalone selling prices where available and either a combination of an adjusted market assessment approach, an expected cost plus a margin approach, and/or a residual approach to determine the standalone selling prices for separate performance obligations as a basis for allocating contract consideration when an observable selling price is not available.
TECOGEN INC.
Under complete turnkey installation service contracts our performance obligation under such contracts is satisfied progressively over time as enhancements are made to customer owned and controlled properties. We measure progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation based on an input method based on cost and revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method determined on a cost-to-cost basis. This method requires management to estimate future cost to complete based on conditions and information available at the time the estimate is made. Events or changes in circumstances can cause these estimates to be revised which may result in significant adjustments to revenue amounts previously recognized.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management’s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable at the end of the year.
Inventory
Raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value. We periodically review inventory quantities on hand for excess and/or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand. Any reserves that result from this review are charged to cost of sales.
ADGE's Property and Equipment and Depreciation
Upon acquisition, property and equipment employed in energy production are recorded at fair value using a cost approach whereby replacement cost new ("RCN") is utilized as the starting point, with factors for inflation, physical obsolescence, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence being considered and applied as required to arrive at an estimated fair value.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to write off the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
We review our energy systems for potential impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are no longer appropriate. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets when impairment is indicated by comparing the net book value of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. The useful life of the Company's energy systems is the lesser of the economic life of the asset or the term of the underlying contract with the customer, typically 12 to 15 years. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
The favorable contract asset and unfavorable contract liability included in the intangible assets and liabilities of the consolidated balance sheets represent the fair value of customer energy production contracts (both positive for favorable contracts and negative for unfavorable contracts) which were acquired by us.
The determination of fair value requires development of an estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Contracts are considered to be assets or liabilities by virtue of the rights and obligations inherent in the contract terms. Typically, contracts with terms considered to be at market are considered to have no fair value as, in order to be entitled to the rights under the contract, performance must occur for which a market rate of return is earned due to the at market terms. The fair value of a contract is primarily a measurement of its off-market terms. The obligation to perform under a contract with terms that are unfavorable to market results in a liability to the extent its terms are off market. The resulting liability is an estimate of the price that would need to be paid to a willing market participant to assume the obligations under the contract in order for them to receive a market rate of return for their remaining performance obligation under the contract. The exact opposite holds true in instances where the terms of a contract are considered to be favorable to market. In that case an asset would exist as an estimate of the price that would be received from a willing market participant in order to be entitled to the rights under the contract.
In determining the estimate of fair value of customer energy production contracts, the measure of market, and thus the baseline to measure the amount related to any of the off-market terms or conditions with respect to the contracts, was considered best determined, given the nature of the services provided under the contracts, by utilizing a benchmark level of margin, in this case 35% of revenue which is consistent with the average return on revenue of US investor owned public utilities.

Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger the two-step impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.
During 2018, we early-adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 which simplified goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill where a quantitative analysis indicates that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
At a minimum, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the year following an acquisition involving a significant amount of goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for our energy production reporting unit acquired in 2017. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the carrying amount of that reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded the estimated fair value and an impairment charge of $2,875,711 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of our energy production reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2021, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value of the reporting unit. Based on this analysis there was no impairment at December 31, 2021. See Note 5. "Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment".
The impairment analysis recognizes the shortening of remaining contract terms with customers without replacement and without further growth, as well as less than expected cost savings and, offset by profitability from our initiatives to optimize the long-term profitability of our various site operations, and a price peak of the Company's stock on the date of the business combination to which the goodwill relates (see also Note 5."Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment").
The discount rate, profitability assumptions, and terminal growth rate of this reporting unit were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate its fair value. The discount rate reflects an estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital.
The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. The long-range plan reflects management's judgment and assumptions about future events.
We believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the percentages of the net sales represented by certain items reflected in our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
TECOGEN INC.
The following table presents revenue by segment and the change from the prior year for the years ended December 31:
Revenues in 2021 were $24,398,073 compared to $28,254,579 in 2020, a decrease of $3,856,506 or 13.6%. Product revenues in 2021 were $10,133,329 compared to $11,466,716 in 2020, a decrease of $1,333,387 or 11.6%. This decrease from the year ended December 31, 2020 to 2021 is due primarily to a decrease in cogeneration sales of $5,969,300 due to decreased unit volume, which is partially offset by an increase in chiller sales of $4,422,674 and a $213,239 increase in sales of engineered accessories. Our product mix, as well as product revenue, can vary significantly from period to period as our products are high dollar, low volume sales in which revenue is recognized upon shipment and to some degree were impacted by COVID-19 as energy and other constructions projects were delayed.
Revenues derived from our service centers, including installation activities, in 2021 were $12,525,594 compared to $14,950,682 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $2,425,088 or 16.2%. Our service operation grows with the sales of installed systems, since the majority of our product sales are accompanied by a service contract or time and materials agreements. As a result our “fleet” of units being serviced by our service department grows with product sales.
Energy Production revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,739,150 compared to $1,837,181 for 2020, a decrease of $98,031, or 5.3%. This reduction in Energy Production revenue is primarily due to seasonal variations, the impact of COVID-19 resulting in the permanent closure of some hotel properties and a change to remote work and learning environments, resulting in decreased energy usage.
TECOGEN INC.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales in 2021 was $12,810,420 compared to $17,427,065 in 2020, a decrease of $4,616,645 or 26.5%. Our overall gross margin was 47.5% in 2021 compared to 38.3% in 2020, an increase of 11.1%. The decrease in cost of sales is due to the reduction of Products and Energy Production revenues and their related cost of sales, while the increase in gross margin percentage is due to a reduction in lower margin installation activities.
Cost of sales for Energy Production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,074,421 compared to $1,169,645 in 2020, decreased primarily due to reduced operations in 2021. Included in Energy Production cost of sales is depreciation expense associated with the energy producing sites, net of amortization of favorable and unfavorable contract liability of $88,710.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses decreased in 2021 to $12,806,745 compared to $16,787,827 in 2020, a decrease of $3,981,082 or (23.7)%.
General and administrative expenses decreased $515,263 to $9,795,823 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $10,311,086 in 2020 due primarily to a $525,191 reduction in bad debt expense and in part due to management's effort to control overhead costs, resulting in a $347,457 decrease in payroll and related costs, partially offset by an increase in travel related expenses of $93,701, increased business insurance of $88,154, increased rent and facility cost of $78,012 and a $70,255 increase in depreciation and amortization recognized in 2021. In addition, selling expenses decreased in 2021 to $2,471,929 compared to $2,593,168 in 2020, a decrease of $121,239 due to a $61,491 decrease in payroll and related benefits and a $45,308 decrease in royalties. Research and development expenses decreased by $225,244 as certain R&D projects were curtailed or stopped entirely as a consequence of COVID-19.
Gains on the sale of assets of $10,486 were recognized in 2021 in connection with the sale of certain assets, which compares to a gain on the sale of assets of $11,367 recognized in 2020 due to the sales of certain assets.
Impairment of long-lived assets decreased $244,506 to $7,400 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $251,906 in 2020 due primarily to the impairment of certain energy production assets and the abandonment of patent applications recorded in 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 we recorded a goodwill impairment of $2,875,711 as discussed in Note 9."Goodwill".
Loss from Operations
Loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,219,092 compared to a loss of $5,960,313 in 2020, a decrease in the loss from operations of $4,741,221. The decrease in the net loss from operations is primarily due to a decrease in the goodwill impairment of $2,875,711 and a decrease in long-lived asset impairment of $244,506 when compared to 2020, as discussed in Note 9."Goodwill", Note 7. "Intangible assets and liabilities other than goodwill" and Note 8. "Property, plant and equipment"in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Improvement in loss from operations was also helped by the higher gross gross margin of 47.5% in 2021 compared to 38.3% in 2020, and a 23.7% reduction in operating costs.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,979,600 compared to an expense of $226,707 for the same period in 2020. The extinguishment of Paycheck Protection Program debt and the Employee Retention Credit contributed $3,773,014 and $1,276,021 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other income (expense) includes interest and other expense
TECOGEN INC.
of $23,746 and net interest expense on debt of $14,238 in 2021. For the same period in 2020, interest and other expense was $2,479 and interest expense was $125,824. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other expense, net also includes the unrealized loss on securities of $37,497 compared to $98,404 for the same period in 2020, which represents the market value fluctuation of marketable equity securities as discussed in Note 15. "Fair value measurements".
Noncontrolling Interest
With the addition of American DG Energy, we have income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest we have in American DG Energy's 51% owned subsidiary, ADGNY, LLC. The noncontrolling interest share of ADGNY profits and losses was a $45,017 income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and loss of $66,684 in 2020. The noncontrolling interest recognized a loss in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the goodwill impairment recognized.
Net Income Attributable to Tecogen Inc
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $3,696,000 compared to a net loss of $6,150,507 for the comparable period in 2020. This was primarily due to the Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness and Employee Retention Credit contributing $3,773,014 and $1,276,021 respectively in 2021. Additionally, the reduction in loss from operations of $4,741,221 or 79.5% further contributed to a profitable 2021.
Net Income Per Share
Net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.15 compared to a $0.25 loss per share for the same period in 2020. The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 24,850,261 and 25,115,518, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, basic and diluted shares were 24,850,258.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table presents a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:
Consolidated working capital at December 31, 2021 was $16,193,881, compared to $13,023,598 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3,170,283 or 24.3%. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $3,614,463 at December 31, 2021, compared to $1,490,219 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,124,244 or 142.5%. The increase in consolidated working capital is primarily due to the second draw Paycheck Protection Program loan and positive cash flow from operations.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $465,033 and $1,407,237, respectively, a decrease of $942,204 in net cash provided by operating activities. Our accounts receivable balance decreased by $57,618 at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Unbilled revenues also decreased by $1,009,060 in connection with turnkey projects as some revenues are recognized prior to contractual milestones for invoicing. Our inventory increased by $596,393 as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 and other non-current assets decreased by $231,478 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.
Accounts payable decreased by $674,750 from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Accrued expenses from operations decreased by $602,073 as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 due to lower operating expenses. Deferred revenues decreased by $756,722 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.
During 2021, our cash flows used by investing activities were $215,058, and included purchases of property and equipment of $91,451, distributions to non-controlling interests of $82,633, capital outlays related to intangible assets such as patents and product certification of $63,097.
During 2021, our cash flows from financing activities were $1,874,269, being the receipt of proceeds from the Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1,874,269.
Our total product and installation backlog as of December 31, 2021 was $11.3 million compared to $8.3 million as of December 31, 2020. Backlog does not include maintenance contract service revenues or energy contract revenues.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,614,463 and $1,490,219, an increase of $2,124,244 or 142.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were negatively impacted due to customer order delays or deferrals; service delays due to customer facility closures, in some cases for extended periods and a reduction in our energy production revenues, due to business closures and increased remote work and learning environments. The extent to which the coronavirus will continue to impact our business, our financial results and our cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe existing resources, including cash and cash flows from operations, together with the $1,276,021 of proceeds anticipated to be received from the Employee Retention Credit, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. However, if we seek to grow our business, we expect that our cash requirements will increase. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing to meet our operating and capital needs for future growth.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We are obligated under operating leases for our Waltham, Massachusetts headquarters and our eleven leased service centers through February 2026. Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2021 were $1,956,277. See Note 13. "Leases.”
Seasonality
We expect that the majority of our heating systems sales will be operational for the winter and the majority of our chilling systems sales will be operational for the summer. Our cogeneration sales are not generally affected by the seasons. Our service team does experience higher demand in the warmer months when cooling is required. Chiller units for space conditioning applications are generally shut down in the winter and started up again in the spring. This chiller “busy season” for the service team generally runs from May through the end of September. Chillers in indoor cultivation and other process cooling applications run year round.
