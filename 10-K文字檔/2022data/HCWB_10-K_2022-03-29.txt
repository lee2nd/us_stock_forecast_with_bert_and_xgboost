Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions, that are based on the beliefs of our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen health span by disrupting the link between chronic, low-grade inflammation and age-related diseases. We believe age-related, chronic, low-grade inflammation, or “inflammaging,” is a significant contributing factor to several diseases and conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune diseases. The induction and retention of low-grade inflammation in an aging human body is mainly the result of the accumulation of non-proliferative senescent cells and persistent activation of protein complexes, known as inflammasomes, in innate immune cells. These two elements share common mechanisms in promoting secretion of proinflammatory proteins and in many cases interact to drive inflammaging. Our novel approach is to treat both of these elements. We believe our approach has the potential to fundamentally change the treatment of age-related diseases.
Our gateway indication for clinical development is oncology. Advances in immuno-stimulatory and anti-immunosuppressive therapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, and our internally-developed, lead product candidate, HCW9218, is designed with both of these functionalities. We believe the bifunctionality of HCW9218 will allow it to be effective against solid tumor cancers because it simultaneously provides immunostimulation of natural killer (“NK”) cells and effector T cells to enhance the cytotoxicity of immune cells against tumor targets, while reducing immunosuppression associated with solid tumors by capturing and neutralizing TGF-β. The FDA has permitted two clinical trials in difficult-to-treat cancer indications to proceed. These include a Company-sponsored trial to evaluate HCW9218 in advanced pancreatic cancer, and an Investigator-sponsored trial by Masonic Cancer Center at University of Minnesota to evaluate HCW9218 in other solid tumors. We expect both trials to initiate in the first half of 2022.
Our internally-developed, lead product candidate, HCW9302, an IL-2-based fusion molecule that expands Treg cells in vivo and ex vivo as an injectable or cell-based strategy, is designed to reduce inflammation through deactivation of inflammasomes. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the ability of HCW9302 to reduce inflammation, allowing for the potential to treat a wide variety of autoimmune and age-related diseases. We expect to complete IND-enabling activities for an autoimmune indication by the end of 2022. Upon completion of IND-enabling activities, we intend to submit an IND for a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate HCW9302 in alopecia areata.
Since commencing operations in 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to building our research and development capabilities, and establishing our corporate infrastructure. To date, we have not generated any product revenue and we have never been profitable. We have incurred significant operating losses since the commencement of our operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $30.6 million. Our cumulative net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $15.1 million and $27.9 million, respectively. Our net losses for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $5.8 million and $12.9 million, respectively. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize a drug candidate, and we cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits from product sales.
To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds of $29.4 million from the sale and issuance of redeemable preferred stock, $49.2 million in net proceeds from our IPO, and to a lesser extent, the proceeds of upfront payments from an out-license agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.7 million, short-term investments in U.S. government-backed securities of $25.0 million, and long-term investments in U.S. government-backed securities of $9.9 million.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our clinical development activities, particularly if and as we:
•Advance the development of our lead product candidate, HCW9218, and clinical trials for oncology, and if approved by the FDA, commercialization;
•Advance preclinical development of other indications for HCW9218, including fibrotic indications, especially those resulting in NAFLD and liver cancer;
•Advance the preclinical development of our second lead product candidate, HCW9302, for autoimmune diseases and pro-inflammatory diseases, such as coronary artery disease;
•Establish our own domestic manufacturing capability;
•Maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•Scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities; and
•Expand operational and management information systems as well as investor relations, legal, accounting, and audit services required to operate as a public company.
As a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and pursuit of our clinical development strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenues from sales of an approved drug or drugs, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings or other financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, co-development deals, and out-licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may need to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates which may have a negative impact on our financial condition.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses through the end of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Our future viability beyond 2023 is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations and fund capital expenditure requirements. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.
Recent Developments
The Company achieved several milestones in the past year:
•Initial Public Offering. On July 19, 2021, the Company’s S-1 registration statement for an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") was declared effective. On July 22, 2021, the Company closed its IPO resulting in net proceeds of approximately $49.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses paid by the Company.
•FDA clearance for Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial in cancer. On October 28, 2021, the Company announced that we were cleared by the FDA to proceed to evaluate our lead drug candidate, HCW9218, in a first-in-human Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We expect to initiate this multi-center trial in the first half of 2022.
•FDA clearance for Investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial in cancer. On January 24, 2022, the Company announced that the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota was cleared by the FDA to proceed to evaluate our lead drug candidate, HCW9218, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors with progressive disease after prior chemotherapies. We expect to initiate this single-center trial in the first half of 2022.
•Three publications in peer-reviewed journals. We are successfully executing our strategy to publish pivotal scientific papers to establish our leadership in oncology and other age-related diseases in the scientific and clinical communities. Thus far, three papers have been published:
oAn article in Cancer Immunology Research describing our platform: Becker-Hapak MK, et al. A Fusion Protein Complex Combines IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 Signaling to Induce Memory-like NK Cells for Cancer Immunotherapy. September 9, 2021.
oAn article in Molecular Therapy on the characterization of our lead molecules, HCW9218: Liu B et al., Bifunctional TGF-ß Trap/IL-15 Protein Complex Elicits Potent NK Cell and CD8 + T Cell Immunity Against Solid Tumors. October 6, 2021.
oAn article in Molecular Therapy which discusses HCW9218 and its ability to augment anti-tumor activity and reduce side effects of chemotherapy regimens: Chaturvedi, P et al., Immunotherapeutic HCW9218 Augments Anti-tumor Activity of Chemotherapy via NK Cell Mediated Reduction of Therapy Induced Senescent Cells, January 17, 2022.
Trends and Uncertainties - COVID-19 Pandemic
There created significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. and international economies and, as such, we are unable to determine if it will have a material impact on our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact U.S. and international markets and supply chains through the spread of COVID-19 variants.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and its impact on our development activities, third-party manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. See "Risk Factors-- Public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could materially and adversely affect our preclinical and clinical trials, business, financial condition, and results of operations."
For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please read section titled “Risk Factors” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Components of Results of Operation
Revenues
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Until that occurs, our sole source of revenue will be derived from out-licenses, collaborative agreements, and co-development deals.
On June 18, 2021, we entered into a master services agreement with Wugen related to a development supply agreement, under which the Company will sell cGMP and non-cGMP grade licensed molecules to Wugen for clinical development. As of December 31, 2021, we had not finalized any statements of work for orders placed under the master services agreement. Thus, as of December 31, 2021, a contract does not exist between Wugen and the Company on which to base revenue recognition for the sale of material to Wugen. Revenues will be deferred until such time as a contact exists. In future periods, we intend to enter into an agreement with Wugen for commercial supply of licensed molecules when commercialization commences. In addition, under the terms of the Wugen License, we may be eligible to receive additional cash payments that will be recognized as revenue, including development and commercialization milestones and single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are reported as research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:
•Employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
•Expenses related to manufacturing and materials, consisting primarily of expenses incurred in connection with third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMO”), that produce cGMP materials for clinical trials on our behalf.
•Expenses associated with preclinical activities, including research and development and other IND-enabling activities.
•Expenses incurred in connection with clinical trials.
•Other expenses, such as facilities-related expenses, direct depreciation costs for capitalized laboratory equipment, and an allocation for overhead.
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. Costs for contract manufacturing are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the agreement, and the pattern of payments for goods and services will change depending on the material. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
We expect research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates. We cannot reasonably determine the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages. We expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our lead product candidates, advance into later stages of development, begin to conduct larger clinical trials, expand our product pipeline, continue to maintain, expand, protect, and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, and establish our own manufacturing capabilities. In particular, we expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we progress to Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials for our lead product candidates, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.
The duration, costs, and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates are highly uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
•Number and scope of preclinical and IND-enabling studies;
•Successful and timely patient enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;
•Per subject trial costs;
•Number of trials required for regulatory approval;
•Number of sites included in the trials;
•Number of subjects needed for each trial;
•Cost and timing of manufacturing of cGMP materials for clinical trials;
•Receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•Establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities; and
•Costs to maintain, defend, and enforce our intellectual property rights.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, for employees in the executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include third-party costs such as insurance costs, fees for professional services, such as legal, auditing and tax services, facilities administrative costs, and other expenses.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as the size of our business grows to support additional research and development activities. We anticipate increased expenses relating to our operations as a public company, including increased costs for the hiring of additional personnel, and for payment to outside consultants, including lawyers and accountants, to comply with additional regulations, corporate governance, internal control and similar requirements applicable to public companies, as well as increased costs for insurance.
Interest and Other Income, Net
Interest and other income, net consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in U.S. government-backed securities, and other income related to non-operating activities, offset by miscellaneous non-operating expenses.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:
* - not meaningful
Revenue
In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $4.1 million of revenue, as a result of entering into the Wugen License. No revenues were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021.
On December 24, 2020, we entered into the Wugen License. We assessed the Wugen License and determined this was a transaction with a customer and should be accounted for under Topic 606. The three performance obligations that had been satisfied as of the effective date of the Wugen License were: (1) exclusive worldwide license, (2) vials of HCW9201, and (3) R&D know-how.
This is the first time we have entered into an out-license arrangement and the first time the Company has established prices for its goods and services. Accordingly, the standalone selling price of the various performance obligations is uncertain, and we determined that an observable standalone selling price was not available for the identified performance obligations under the Wugen License. Where a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling price considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer that is reasonably available. The process for determining a standalone selling price involves significant judgment and includes consideration of multiple factors, including assumptions related to the market opportunity and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the relevant license, estimated direct expenses, and other costs.
The estimated transaction price for performance obligations that were satisfied as of December 31, 2020 was $4.1 million. First, we determined a standalone selling price of $2.5 million for the vials of HCW9201 and the R&D know-how. The prices were determined based on costs for developing the know-how and costs incurred in producing the vials. The standalone selling price for the license was then determined using the residual approach and was priced at $1.6 million.
As of December 31, 2020, we recorded $2.5 million in Accounts receivable, net for the nonrefundable payments related to the sale of non-financial assets to Wugen that were due after the reporting period. The Company records amounts as accounts receivable when the right to consideration is deemed unconditional.
On June 18, 2021, the Company entered into a master services agreement with Wugen related to supply of licensed molecules for use in research and clinical development. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not finalized any statements of work, which will specify the performance obligations required to be completed by the Company for supplies ordered by Wugen. Thus, a contract did not exist as of December 31, 2021. Revenues will be deferred until a contract exists. The standalone selling price for materials purchased during the year ended December 31, 2021 was determined using industry-standard “cost plus” terms which is the pricing set forth in the Wugen License. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed, or yet to be billed to the Company’s customer, where payment has been received for which the related revenues have not been recognized because one or more of the revenue recognition criteria have not been met.
Because a contract did not exist as of December 31, 2021, we deferred revenue recognition. As of December 31, 2021, we recognized $1.8 million of deferred revenue, included within Accrued liabilities and other current liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. The Company’s policy is to recognize deferred revenue only to the extent product release occurred after meeting specification required, product is shipped, and cash payment is received.
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:
Research and development expenses increased by $918,397, or 13%, from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in preclinical expenses and salaries, benefits and related expenses.
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $99,257, or 4%, from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in salaries, performance bonuses, and benefits of $313,745 and an increase in payroll taxes of $25,624, offset by a reimbursement of $240,000 for certain expenses incurred as required under the terms of the Wugen License.
Manufacturing and materials expenses decreased $76,663, or 3%, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, various testing and quality control procedures were conducted on the materials manufactured in 2019 and 2020 to ensure materials met all expected quality requirements. Beginning in May 2020, we launched manufacturing for three additional molecules as well as larger cGMP production runs of the internally-developed affinity ligand used in our manufacturing process. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed necessary procedures to release clinical materials for HCW9218. Additionally, the Company conducted several manufacturing activities for HCW9302, including initiating the master cell bank characterization, effecting a technology transfer to our contract manufacturer, performing a 200-liter cGMP production run, as well as other testing procedures.
Expenses associated with preclinical activities increased by $819,246, or 69%, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is due primarily to an increase in expenses for the toxicology studies for HCW9218 required to prepare for submission of our IND to evaluate HCW9218 in a pancreatic cancer trial, and toxicology studies for HCW9302, which is a multi-dose nonhuman primate toxicology study that began in the second half of 2021 and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. Upon completion of IND-enabling activities, we intend to submit an IND for a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate HCW9302 in alopecia areata.
Expenses associated with clinical trials including professional fees related to regulatory filings, increased by $14,706, or 6%, from $234,498 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $249,204 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company expects to initiate two clinical trials for cancer indications in the first half of 2022. One of these trials is a Phase 1b, Company-sponsored study to evaluate HCW9218 in advanced pancreatic cancer. The other is a Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by the Masonic Cancer Center at University of Minnesota to evaluate HCW9218 in solid tumors, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancers. As we
advance our product candidates through clinical development, we expect our clinical trial expenses to increase significantly, as we conduct larger, later-stage clinical trials and expand the number of indications we advance in clinical development.
Other expenses consist primarily of direct depreciation costs for laboratory equipment, an allocation for rent expense, repairs and maintenance, as well as general office furniture and supplies. The increase from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to an increase in repairs and maintenance, office equipment, and rent expense, offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.
General and Administrative Expenses
The following table summarizes our general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:
General and administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 95%, from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is attributable primarily to an increase in salaries, benefits and related expenses, professional services fees, and other expenses.
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $849,425, or 57%, from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is attributable primarily to an increase of $367,750 for performance-based bonuses paid upon the successful completion of the Wugen License and the IPO and an increase of $323,453 in stock-based compensation expense. Professional services increased primarily due to legal services required for patent filings and advisories fees paid for investor relations services. Other expenses increase is primarily due to an increase in insurance premiums.
We expect to incur increasing general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses for SEC reporting, investor relations, additional insurance requirements, and other administrative expenses. We expect to increase our administrative function to support the growth in our business and public company reporting requirements.
Interest and Other Income, Net
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, other income (expense), net increased by $483,042 primarily due to the forgiveness of the SBA Paycheck Protection Loan and accrued interest.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and our IPO. From our inception in 2018 to July 19, 2021, the effective date of our IPO, we raised net proceeds of approximately $85.4 million, including $49.2 million of net proceeds from the IPO.
Based on our existing business plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses through the end of 2023.
We have based our projections of operation expenses and capital expenditure requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use all of our available capital sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the clinical development and commercialization of immunotherapeutics, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of capital requirements to pursue these activities. Our funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•Timing, progress, costs, and results of our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our immunotherapeutic products;
•Impact of COVID-19 on the timing and progress of our clinical trials and our ability to identify and enroll patients;
•Costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•Number of trials required for regulatory approval;
•Whether we enter into any collaboration or co-development agreements and the terms of such agreements;
•Effect of competing technology and market developments;
•Cost of maintaining, expanding, and enforcing our intellectual property rights; and
•Costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development expenditures.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us additional covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others rights to our drug candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves.
Summary of Statements of Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of net loss for the period of $5.8 million and an increase in Accounts receivable of $2.5 million pursuant to the Wugen License, partially offset by $595,911 of depreciation and amortization.
Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of net loss for the period of $12.9 million, a gain on extinguishment of debt of $567,311, and an increase in Prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.8 million, primarily offset by an decrease of $2.4 million in Accounts receivable, an increase of $1.9 million in Accounts payable and other liabilities, and $595,765 of depreciation and amortization.
Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the cash used in investing activities reflects the purchase of laboratory equipment and general office equipment.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities reflects the purchase of U.S. government-backed securities with the proceeds of our IPO and the purchase of laboratory equipment and general office equipment. As of December 31, 2021, we held $34.9 million in U.S. government-backed securities.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $11.7 million, consisting of an increase of $11.1 million from proceeds from the issuance of Series C redeemable preferred stock and an increase of $563,590 from proceeds from an SBA Paycheck Protection Loan.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $49.3 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $49.2 million from our IPO.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As of December 31, 2021, we had $36,000 of obligations for the two months remaining in the lease terms for a non-cancellable operating lease agreement and a short-term sublease agreement related to our facilities in Miramar, Florida. On February 25, 2022, HCW Biologics was assigned all rights, title, and interest in the primary lease which underlies the sublease. Effective March 1, 2022, we entered into a lease extension for our current location for a period of two years. Total contractual obligations under the lease extension are $339,300, all of which are due by February 29, 2024.
The Company has commitments with a third-party manufacturing organization to supply us with clinical grade materials. As of December 31, 2021, we are under contract for obligations of $2.5 million that we expect to pay during the two years ending December 31, 2023.
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts for non-clinical studies, preclinical testing, and other services and products. These contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice and therefore we believe that our non-cancellable obligations under these agreements are not material.
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgements and Use of Estimates
The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 1 to our financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgements and estimates.
Revenue Recognition
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we adopted provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Under Topic 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to our customer. Refer to Note 1 to our financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to revenue recognition.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy for those instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between fair value measurements based on market data (observable inputs), and those based on our own assumptions (unobservable inputs). This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
•Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
•Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
•Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require a reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
Fair Value
Under the Wugen License, we received shares of common stock of Wugen on the effective date of the Wugen License. We estimated that the fair value of the stock was $1.6 million. As the common stock of Wugen is not currently publicly traded, the fair value was determined based on inputs other than a public market price. We relied primarily on the most recent third-party financing completed by Wugen. In addition, we considered the results of a third-party valuation assessment. Since our ownership interest in Wugen is less than 20% and we do not have significant influence over the operations of Wugen, we account for these securities as a cost method investment. We will carry this investment at cost less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same investee. We assess the investment each reporting period to determine if an impairment has occurred. In the event that a public market becomes available for the common stock of Wugen in the future and the shares become freely tradeable, we will recognize changes in fair value according to the market price in other income in the statements of operations.
Stock-based Compensation
As described in Note 1 and Note 10 to our audited financial statements which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we maintain a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, non-employees, and directors. The plan allows for grants of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, and other forms of equity awards. We have granted options with service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.
We measure our stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the option on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and recognize compensation expense over the vesting period. Compensation expense is recorded as either research and development or general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations based on the function to which the related services are provided. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. We estimate grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
For stock option grants with service-based vesting, stock-based compensation expense represents the portion of the grant date fair value of employee stock option grants recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. For options that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, the Company estimates fair value at the date of grant and compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method when it is determined that the performance criteria is probable of being met.
In determining the fair value of the stock-based awards, we use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and its determination generally requires significant judgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to:
•Fair Value of Common Stock-Prior to our initial public offering, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuation of our common stock as well as our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent third-party valuation to the date of the grant. Since the completion of our initial public offering on July 19, 2021, the fair value of each share of common stock underlying stock option grants is based the quoted market price on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded on the day the stock award or option is granted.
•Expected term-The expected term of stock options is determined using the “simplified” method, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to the Company’s lack of sufficient historical data.
•Expected volatility-Since there is no trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the historical equity volatility for comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.
•Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Bond in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the exit event.
•Dividend yield-The expected dividend yield is 0% because the Company has not historically paid, and does not expect, for the foreseeable future, to pay a dividend on its common stock.
Determination of the Fair Value of Our Common Stock
Until July 19, 2021 when our IPO was effective, there was no public market for our common stock historically. Prior to this offering, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date, which may be as a date later than the most recent third-party valuation date, including:
•results of third-party valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting Practice Aid entitled, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation;
•the prices at which we sold shares of redeemable preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the redeemable preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;
•the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of preclinical and planned clinical trials for our product candidates;
•our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy;
•external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry;
•our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;
•the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our redeemable preferred stock;
•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO, or a sale of our company considering prevailing market conditions; and
•the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.
For financial reporting purposes, it is our policy to perform a contemporaneous valuation when a material number of stock awards or options are granted. As a private company, we relied primarily on the evidence of third-party financings to support valuation of common stock. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change, and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.
Now that we have completed our IPO, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on its closing price as reported on the date of grant according to the quoted market price on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In evaluating our valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had available federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $14.8 million and $26.1 million, respectively. We also had available state NOLs carryforwards of approximately $15.2 million and $26.8 million, as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The federal and state NOLs will carryforward indefinitely. Federal NOLs are available to offset up to 100% of taxable income for tax years before 2021, and state NOLs are available to offset 80% of taxable income for tax years starting after 2020.
Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards that could be used annually in the future to offset taxable income. The tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state NOL carryforwards, credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceeds 50% within any three-year period. We have not completed a Section 382/383 analysis under the Code regarding the limitation of NOL and credit carryforwards. If a change in ownership were to have occurred, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards and credits before utilization.
We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities or reduce the underlying tax attribute, as applicable, and adjust them when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to our audited annual financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Status
As an emerging growth company, or EGC, under the JOBS Act, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for EGCs include presentation of only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement for an initial public offering, or IPO, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We may remain classified as an EGC until the end of the fiscal year until December 31, 2026, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more in any fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of December 31 of the applicable year. We also would cease to be an EGC if we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations, such as an ability to provide simplified executive compensation information and only two years of audited financial statements in an annual report on Form 10-K, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure.
