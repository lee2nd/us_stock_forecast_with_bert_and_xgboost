Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company considers its determination of the allowance for loan losses, goodwill impairment, and the valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies.
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the general practices of the United States banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When these sources are not available, management makes estimates based upon what it considers to be the best available information.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that exist in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (1) FASB ASC Topic 450 “Contingencies,” which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and (2) FASB ASC 310 “Receivables,” which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan. The loss, if any, is determined by the difference between the loan balance and the value of collateral, the present value of expected future cash flows or values observable in the secondary markets.
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate based upon management’s evaluation of the loan portfolio. The allowance includes a specific and a general component. The specific component consists of management’s evaluation of impaired loans. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis using one of three acceptable methods: the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. Management assesses the ability of the borrower to repay the loan based upon all information available. Loans are examined to determine a specific allowance based upon the borrower’s payment history, economic conditions specific to the loan or borrower and other factors that would impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan on its contractual basis. Depending on the assessment of the borrower’s ability to pay and the type, condition and value of collateral, management will establish an allowance amount specific to the loan.
Management uses a risk scale to assign grades to commercial relationships, which include commercial real estate, residential rentals, construction and land development, commercial loans and commercial equipment loans. All commercial loan relationships are graded at inceptions and at a minimum annually. Prior to and at December 31, 2020, only commercial loan relationships with an aggregate exposure to the Bank of $1,000,000 or greater were risk rated. Residential first mortgages, home equity and second mortgages and consumer loans are monitored on an ongoing basis based on borrower payment history. Consumer loans and residential real estate loans are classified as unrated unless they are part of a larger commercial relationship that requires grading or are troubled debt restructures or nonperforming loans with an Other Assets Especially Mentioned or higher risk rating due to a delinquent payment history.
The Company’s commercial loan portfolio is periodically reviewed by regulators and independent consultants engaged by management.
In establishing the general component of the allowance, management analyzes non-impaired loans in the portfolio including changes in the amount and type of loans. This analysis includes trends by portfolio segment in charge-offs, delinquency, classified loans, loan concentrations and the rate of portfolio segment growth. Qualitative factors also include an assessment of the current regulatory environment, the quality of credit administration and loan portfolio management and national and local economic trends. Based upon this analysis a loss factor is applied to each loan category and the Bank adjusts the loan loss allowance by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses.
Management has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral, assessing a borrower’s prospects of repayment and in establishing loss factors on the general component of the allowance. Changes in loss factors have a direct impact on the amount of the provision and on net income. Errors in management’s assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio and may result in additional provisions.
For additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in this MD&A.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Bank is the only reporting unit of the Company with intangible assets.
In the third quarter of 2020, management determined that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the banking industry was deemed a triggering event that required an interim impairment test for goodwill. Management engaged an independent consultant to assist management with a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as of September 15, 2020 ("the measurement date"). The impairment analysis used both market and income approaches. The market approach used transaction and control premium analyses and compared resulting valuations both individually and to a selected peer group. The income approach analyzed discounted cash flows. The results of the methods were weighted to determine an overall value. The calculation of the goodwill impairment involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of management judgment. Significant estimates and assumptions included, but were not limited to, projected profitability ratios, discount rates, cash flows projections, selection and evaluation of control premiums in appropriate market transactions and selection of peers.
Management concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of the measurement date. Management performed an annual analysis during the fourth quarter of 2020, as there were no changes in the Company's financial statements or operations that would indicate that it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired subsequent to the measurement date, management concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the banking industry and the Company's stock price rebounded from the prior year's impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no triggering events in 2021, no interim goodwill impairment tests were required and management performed an annual analysis during the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, management concluded that goodwill was not impaired as there were no market or financial conditions that would indicate that it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired.
It is possible that the Company's goodwill could become impaired in future periods due to a sustained decline in the Company's stock price or other financial or qualitative measures. In the event that the Company concludes that all or a portion of its goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings in that quarter. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital.
For additional information regarding goodwill, refer to Notes 1 and 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred Tax Assets
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FASB ASC 740 requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Management periodically evaluates the ability of the Company to realize the value of its deferred tax assets. If management were to determine that it would not be more likely than not that the Company would realize the full amount of the deferred tax assets, it would establish a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to the amount it believes would be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Company’s forecast of future taxable income and available tax-planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect the Company’s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: increased competition, a decline in net interest margin, a loss of market share, decreased demand for financial services and national and regional economic conditions.
The Company’s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time. The Company operates within federal and state taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
For additional information regarding income taxes and deferred tax assets, refer to Notes 1 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Statements included in management’s discussion and analysis include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures and believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company’s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. See Non-GAAP reconciliation schedules that immediately follow:
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
Reconciliation of US GAAP total assets, common equity, common equity to assets and book value to Non-GAAP tangible assets, tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible book value.
The Company's management discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. This financial information includes certain performance measures, which exclude intangible assets. These non-GAAP measures are included because the Company believes they may provide useful supplemental information for evaluating the underlying performance trends of the Company.
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES
Return on Average Common Equity ("ROACE")
The ROACE is a financial ratio that measures the profitability of a company in relation to the average shareholders' equity. This financial metric is expressed in the form of a percentage which is equal to net income after tax divided by the average shareholders' equity for a specific period of time.
Return on Average Tangible Common Equity ("ROATCE")
ROATCE is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average tangible common shareholders' equity. Management believes that ROATCE is meaningful because it measures the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or internally developed. ROATCE is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 is presented below.
_______________________________________
(1) Efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
(2) Net operating expense is the sum of non-interest expense offset by non-interest income.
Summary Financial Results
In 2021, profitability increased from a lower loan loss provision, interest-earning asset growth, expense control and a stable net interest margin due primarily to improved funding costs and growth in noninterest-bearing and low cost transaction deposits. We continued to help our community and customers navigate economic uncertainty by originating a third round of U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans ("SBA PPP"). Although, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to present both economic and operational challenges in 2021, there were no customers with COVID-19 deferrals at December 31, 2021. The Company improved credit quality by resolving multiple non-accrual loans and OREO assets, reducing nonperforming assets to 0.35% of total assets at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.08% at December 31, 2020. Management's focus on credit quality and resolution of long-standing classified assets has reduced classified assets to $5.2 million, their lowest level since before 2008.
During 2021, the Company delivered record earnings. We have solidified our market share and improved our deposit franchise in Southern Maryland, establishing a strong foothold in and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, and added new products and technology initiatives in both markets. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $25.9 million or $4.47 per diluted share compared to net income of $16.1 million or $2.74 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s ROAA and ROACE were 1.19% and 12.65% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.81% and 8.46% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $9.8 million increase to net income in 2021 compared to 2020 included decreased loan loss provision of $10.1 million for the comparable periods and increased net interest income of $5.5 million. These additions to net income were partially offset by increased income tax expense of $4.2 million, decreased noninterest income of $0.5 million and increased noninterest expense of $1.1 million for the comparable periods.
Net interest income increased in 2021 primarily due to decreased funding costs and increased interest income from larger loan and investment average balances that outweighed the negative impacts of lower yields earned on loan and investment balances. Because the economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2021, loan loss reserves were not released in 2021, but the total reserve balance decreased as management's efforts to resolve classified and impaired loan balances led to a $1.1 million decrease in specific reserves. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to the $1.2 million wire fraud loss reported in the first quarter and increases in compensation and benefits, which were partially offset by decreased OREO expenses. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to smaller gains on the sale of investment securities and reduced interest rate protection referral fee income. The increase in income tax expense was due to a change in the Company's state tax apportionment approach that was implemented in the first quarter of 2020 as well as higher pre-tax income.
The Company’s efficiency ratio improved from 54.81% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 52.67% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of expense control and increased net interest income. Management believes it is important to continue to focus on creating operating leverage. We believe our continued focus on new products and services will increase non-interest income as a percentage of revenues over time. Controlling expense growth and increasing noninterest income will better prepare the Company for changes in interest rates and credit cycles.
Over the last several years, the Bank's technology strategy was instrumental in slowing the growth of expenses, expanding our customer base, and increasing profitability. Our technology goals include: protecting the data integrity of our platforms and customer information; enhancing operating efficiency; permitting management to quickly respond to unforeseen technology opportunities and challenges, and providing an improved experience for our digital customers.
During the second quarter of 2021, the Bank introduced a new residential mortgage program and a retail and commercial credit card program that merge the technology and expertise of two proven FinTech firms with our business development team's capabilities. The Company expects these programs to improve non-interest income and interest income beginning in 2022-2023. The Bank's credit card program balances increased from approximately $50,000 at June 30, 2021 to just over $1.6 million at December 31, 2021.
Balance sheet financial highlights for 2021 include:
•The Company's on-balance sheet liquidity improved in 2021. Total assets increased $300.9 million or 14.8% in 2021 to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents increased $62.6 million, or 81.22%, to $139.7 million or 6.0% of the total assets and investments increased $251.7 million, or 100.19%, to $502.8 million or 21.6% of total assets.
•Gross portfolio loans increased 5.0% or $74.7 million to $1.58 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by $66.3 million and $56.0 million of growth in our commercial real estate loan portfolio and residential rental loan portfolio, respectively. The increase was partially offset by a $42.7 million decrease in our residential first mortgage portfolio.
•The Bank’s expansion into Virginia has significantly contributed to our growth over the last five years. Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania and surrounding areas provide significant opportunities for continued organic growth supported by our efficient operating model and ability to leverage technology. At December 31, 2021, loans in the greater Fredericksburg, Virginia area accounted for approximately 49% of the Bank's outstanding portfolio loans. In addition, Fredericksburg branch deposits were $93.2 million with an average cost of deposits of four basis points.
•Non-performing assets improved in 2021 comparing December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020:
◦Classified assets as a percentage of assets decreased 88 basis points to 0.22%.
◦Non-accrual loans, OREO and TDRs to total assets decreased 73 basis points to 0.35%.
◦The Company had no COVID-19 deferred loans as of December 31, 2021.
•Total deposits increased $310.6 million or 17.8% to $2.06 billion at December 31, 2021. In 2021, market disruptions caused by both the COVID-19 pandemic and industry consolidation assisted with organic growth and we believe industry consolidation will provide similar opportunities in 2022. The Company expects to service a wider customer base through the addition of the Bank's second full-service branch in Virginia that is expected to open in the second quarter of 2022. Non-interest-bearing accounts and transaction accounts increased to 21.7% and 84.1% of deposits at December 31, 2021 from 20.7% and 79.7% at December 31, 2020.
•On December 9, 2021, the Company announced its Board of Directors approved the resumption of repurchases allowed under the 2020 Stock Purchase Plan. The Company may repurchase the 99,450 shares remaining under the October 2020 stock repurchase plan using up to $4.0 million in the aggregate and up to $1.5 million in the aggregate on a quarterly basis.
•On November 30, 2021, the Company announced a 17% increase of its quarterly per share dividend from $0.15 to $0.175 for the fourth quarter dividend that was paid in the first quarter of 2022.
Balance sheet financial highlights for 2020 include:
•The Company redeemed and issued subordinated notes:
◦On February 15, 2020, the Company redeemed $23.0 million of 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes.
◦On October 14, 2020, the Company issued and sold $20.0 million 4.75% Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. The Company contributed $10.0 million of the net proceeds to the Bank as Tier 1 Capital and used the remaining net proceeds to repurchase shares in 2021 and for general corporate purposes.
Net Interest Income
The primary component of the Company’s net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is affected by the difference between the yields earned on the Company’s interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company’s net interest margin.
Average Balances and Yields:
The following tables set forth average balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effects thereof were not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. There was $0.4 million and $0.6 million of accretion interest during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Average Balances and Yields: (Continued)
** Transaction deposits exclude time deposits.
The tables below summarize changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate); and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). Changes in rate-volume (changes in rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to changes due to volume.
Net interest income totaled $66.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represents a 9.1% increase from $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net interest income increased during 2021 compared to the prior year as the positive impacts of average interest-earning asset growth, income from U.S. SBA PPP loans and decreased funding costs outpaced the negative impacts of lower yields earned on loans and investments. The Bank has increased lower cost transaction deposits in every year over the last six years, including during the pandemic. Non-interest bearing accounts and transaction accounts increased to 21.7% and 84.1% of deposits at December 31, 2021 from 20.7% and 79.7% at December 31, 2020.
Net interest margin of 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2021, was two basis points lower than the 3.36% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Decreased net interest margin resulted primarily from the Company's interest earning asset yields (37 basis points) decreasing at a slightly faster rate than overall funding costs (36 basis points). The sharp decline in interest rates in 2021 not only reduced interest income on floating-rate loans and liquid interest-earning assets and investments, but it also reduced competitive pressures and depositor expectations concerning deposit interest rates. In addition, the continued improvement in the Bank's funding mix, replacing wholesale funding and time deposits with transaction accounts helped margins not further compress in 2021.
Average total earning assets increased 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $1.99 billion compared to $1.82 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average loans increased a $36.2 million with growth in commercial real estate and residential rental loans, partially offset by reductions in residential first mortgage loans. Interest income decreased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period of 2020. The decrease in interest income resulted from lower interest yields accounting for $4.2 million, partially offset by larger average balances of interest-earning assets contributing $3.7 million.
Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased 5.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $1.52 billion compared to $1.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense decreased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period of 2020. Interest expense decreased $6.3 million due to lower interest rates and $0.3 million from increased balances of interest-bearing liabilities.
The Bank's success at increasing transaction accounts, and in particular the increases in noninterest-bearing accounts, was an important factor in managing net interest margin in 2021. In addition, the decrease in time deposits positively impacted margins. During the year ended December 31, 2021, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $93.3 million, or 28.8% to $417.9 million. Average transaction accounts increased $285.4 million or 22.7% to $1.54 billion from $1.26 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the same timeframe average time deposits decreased $28.0 million or 7.5%, to $342.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Funding costs decreased at a faster rate as the percentage of funding coming from transaction accounts increased from 71.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 79.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Interest income accretion on acquired loans contributed $0.4 million and $0.6 million to interest income in 2021 and 2020, respectively. U.S. SBA PPP interest income contributed $5.2 million in 2021 compared to $2.7 million in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net interest margin increased 13 basis points as a result of net U.S. SBA PPP loan interest income recognition compared to decreased net interest margin of three basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In the last six months of 2020, the Company prepaid $30.0 million FHLB advances with a 2.2% average rate. Prepayment fees increased interest expense $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense increased by $0.1 million due to prepayment fees recognized on the early repayment of $15.0 million of higher-rate long-term FHLB advances in the last six months of 2021.
Interest rates decreased in 2020 following the FOMC attempts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy. The FOMC reduced the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% at December 2019 to the current rate of 0.25% in March 2020. The below table illustrates how the Company's average rates responded during the five quarters ending December 31, 2021 and provides a summary of the Company's margins throughout 2021:
Provision for Loan Losses
The following table shows the provision for loan losses for the periods presented.
The provision for loan losses decreased by $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net charge-offs decreased from $2.2 million or 0.15% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.6 million or 0.11% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 as several relationships that were substandard prior to the pandemic were resolved in 2021.The decrease in the loan loss provision during 2021 was mostly attributable to moderate loan growth in 2021 and slight improvements in qualitative and quantitative factors used to calculate the allowance for loans losses. Management believes that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact incurred losses in the loan portfolio and did not release reserves in 2021.
See further discussion of the provision under the Asset Quality section in the Comparison of Financial Condition section of MD&A.
Noninterest Income
The following table shows the components of noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to decreased realized gains and increased unrealized losses on securities and decreased referral fee income partially offset by increased service charge and miscellaneous income. Noninterest income decreased from 0.42% of average assets in 2020 to 0.36% of average assets in 2021.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized net gains of $0.6 million on the sale of AFS securities with aggregate carrying values of $11.9 million. There were $62.5 million of securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 for net gains of $1.4 million.
The Bank refers customers to a third-party financial institution that offers interest rate protection for the length of a loan. This product has enabled the Bank to be more rate competitive with larger institutions in our market area without increasing interest rate risk. The COVID-19 crisis decreased commercial loan volume in 2021, which impacted interest rate protection agreement referral fee opportunities. As a result of the reduced commercial loan volume, 2021 referral fee income decreased 23% from 2020.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Bank sold classified and non-accrual commercial real estate and residential loans with an aggregate amortized cost, net of charge-offs, of $9.1 million and recognized a $0.2 million loss on the sale.
Increased service charges of $0.8 million reflect increased fees from customer acquisition, new products as well as recognition of sign-on bonus fees associated with our Mastercard program.
Noninterest Expense
The following tables show the components of noninterest expense and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
The 3.0% increase in non-interest expense for the comparable periods was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits, fraud losses, professional fees and data processing costs. The increases were partially offset by decreases in OREO expenses, FDIC insurance and occupancy expenses.
Compensation and benefits increased for the comparable periods primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation, higher 2021 healthcare costs, as well as the Company's decision to pay employees for unused vacation in December 2021 that was not available to carry over into 2022. In addition, the deferral of compensation and benefits for the U.S. SBA PPP loans originated were reduced $0.28 million in 2021 as compared to $0.48 million for 2020. The Bank's overall full time equivalent ("FTE") head count fluctuated between 189 and 196 employees for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Fraud losses include a $1.2 million charge, net of a partial recovery, related to an isolated wire transfer fraud incident that occurred in the first quarter of 2021. Our investigation of the first quarter 2021 wire fraud found no evidence that information systems of the Bank were compromised or that employee fraud was involved. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company submitted an insurance claim. Any recovery of insurance proceeds would be recognized in the quarter received.
Data processing and professional fees have increased due to the Bank's larger balance sheet, more customer transaction activity and investments in technology, new products and services. Occupancy expense decreased primarily due to the closure of the St. Patrick's Drive branch in March 2021. FDIC costs decreased due to improved credit trends.
The following is a breakdown of OREO expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The decreased OREO valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect management's actions in 2020 to timely resolve non-performing assets. OREO expenses have moderated in 2021 as the Bank has reduced foreclosed assets from $3.1 million at December 31, 2020 to zero at December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 the efficiency ratio and net operating expense to average asset ratio were 52.67% and 1.44%, respectively compared to 54.81% and 1.49%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management remains committed to controlling expenses through leveraging technology to employ scalable solutions.
Income Tax Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $8.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
The Company's consolidated effective tax rate for 2021 was 25.2% compared to 21.78% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company's new state tax apportionment approach was implemented during the first quarter of 2020 and included the impact of amended income tax returns which reduced consolidated income tax expense by $0.7 million. Management evaluated the tax provision and determined the change in tax position qualified as a change in estimate under FASB ASC Section 250.
The following table shows a breakdown of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 split between the apportionment adjustment and a normalized 2020 income tax provision:
COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020
The following table shows selected historical consolidated financial data for the Company, which has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. You should read this table together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual 10-K report.
**Company issued $20.0 million of 4.75% subordinated notes due 2030 on October 14, 2020.
Assets
Total assets increased $300.9 million or 14.85% to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily due to cash increasing $62.6 million, or 81.22%, to $139.7 million and securities increasing $251.7 million, or 100.19%, to $502.8 million. The differences in allocations between the cash and investment categories reflect both operational needs and excess liquidity that was not deployed into new loan originations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $139.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $77.1 million at December 31, 2020. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate due to transactions in process and other liquidity demands. Management believes liquidity needs are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and wholesale funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year.
Investment Securities and Credit Quality of Investment Securities
Investment securities increased $251.7 million in 2021 to $502.8 million at December 31, 2021 due to no net loan growth and an increase in customer deposits of $310.6 million.. Investment securities and FHLB stock at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, estimated fair value were $504.3 million and $253.9 million, respectively. Management monitors and manages investment portfolio performance and liquidity through monthly reporting including analyses of expected cash inflows and outflows from investment securities. Management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable. The Company did not hold any noninvestment grade securities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. AFS securities are evaluated quarterly to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporarily impaired ("OTTI"). No OTTI charge was recorded for the periods reported.
Gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 for AFS securities were $6.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of amortized cost of $500.5 million and $240.0 million, respectively (see Note 2 in Consolidated Financial Statements). The change in unrealized losses was the result of changes in interest rates and other non-credit related factors, while credit risks remained stable. The Company intends to, and has the ability to, hold investment securities with unrealized losses until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. Management believes that the investment securities with unrealized losses will either recover in market value or be paid off as agreed.
The Bank holds 70.2% or $351.3 million (amortized cost) of its AFS investment securities, as asset-backed securities issued by GSEs or U.S. Agencies, GSE agency bonds or U.S. government obligations. In addition, the Company's investment of $56.4 million (amortized cost) in student loan trusts, which represent 11.3% of the AFS investment portfolio, are 97% U.S. government guaranteed. At December 31, 2021, the Company also had $92.6 million or 18.5% of AFS investments in municipal bonds.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, AFS asset-backed securities issued and guaranteed by GSEs and U.S. Agencies had average lives of 6.91 years and 5.09 years, and average durations of 6.41 years and 4.81 years, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, AFS asset-backed securities issued by student loan trust and others had an average life of 6.24 years and 6.47 years, and an average duration of 6.03 years and 6.14 years, respectively. AFS municipal bonds issued by states, political subdivisions or agencies had an average life of 8.75 years and 9.81 years and an average duration of 7.83 years and 8.53 years at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
The amortized cost of AFS investment securities by contractual maturity at December 31, 2021 are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. The maturities and weighted average yields at December 31, 2021 are shown below.
The tables below present the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or equivalent credit rating from other major rating agencies for AFS investment securities by carrying value at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Company considers noninvestment grade securities rated BB+ or lower as classified assets for regulatory and financial reporting. GSE asset-backed securities and GSE agency bonds with S&P AA+ ratings were treated as AAA based on regulatory guidance.
Loan Portfolio and U.S. SBA PPP Loans
The Bank's primary market areas consist of the tri-county area in Southern Maryland, the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia and Spotsylvania and Stafford counties in Virginia. In 2021, the Bank increased lending in Virginia in the cities and surrounding areas of Culpeper, Orange and Charlottesville. The Bank plans to open a loan production office in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2022. At December 31, 2021, loans in Maryland and Virginia are almost evenly distributed with approximately 49% of the Bank's outstanding portfolio loans in our expanding Virginia market. Management is optimistic that the Virginia market will continue to provide opportunities for organic growth. In addition, management believes that the new residential mortgage program started in the second half of 2021 and expected rising interest rates in 2022, should help reduce the dollar amount of residential first mortgage run-off.
In 2021, net loans decreased $7.3 million primarily due to growth in commercial portfolios being offset by U.S. SBA PPP loan forgiveness and decreases in residential first mortgages. Portfolio loans which includes all loans except the U.S. SBA PPP loans, grew to $1.58 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2020, with commercial portfolios increasing $118.8 million or 8.9% and consumer and residential mortgages portfolios decreasing $44.2 million or 26.9%.
During 2020 and 2021, the Company originated 1,532 U.S. SBA PPP loans with original balances of $201.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, there were 201 U.S. SBA PPP loans with outstanding balances of $27.3 million. The Company is presently assisting customers with forgiveness applications for outstanding loans.
Maturity of Loan Portfolio
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2021 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less.
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans due after one year from December 31, 2021, which have predetermined interest rates and have floating or adjustable interest rates.
Loan Concentrations
At December 31, 2021, commercial loans, which include commercial real estate, residential rental, commercial loans and commercial equipment loans, represent the largest components of the loan portfolio. The Bank's commercial loans are concentrated in our market area; however, these loans are distributed among many different borrowers in numerous industries.
Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate as a percentage of risk-based capital at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $813.0 million or 331.4% and $695.8 million or 316.1%, respectively. Construction loans as a percentage of risk-based capital at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $140.4 million or 57.2% and $139.2 million and 63.2%, respectively.
Asset Quality
The following table shows asset quality information and ratios at and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
___________________________________________
(1) Nonperforming loans include all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent.
(2) Non-accrual loans include all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent and loans that are non-accrual due to the operating results or cash flows of a customer.
(3) TDR loans include both non-accrual and accruing performing loans. All TDR loans are included in the calculation of asset quality financial ratios. Non-accrual TDR loans are included in the non-accrual balance and accruing TDR loans are included in the accruing TDR balance.
Allowance for Loan Losses ("ALLL") and Provision for Loan Losses ("PLL")
The following is a breakdown of the Company’s general and specific allowances as a percentage of gross portfolio loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020:
** Non-acquired loans include loans transferred from acquired pools following release of acquisition accounting FMV adjustments.
(1) Portfolio loans include all loan portfolios except the U.S. SBA PPP loan portfolio.
The Company's allowance methodology considers quantitative historical loss factors and qualitative factors to determine the estimated level of incurred losses in the Company's loan portfolios. The ALLL increased in 2020 primarily due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to provide for economic uncertainty. ALLL levels decreased to 1.17% of portfolio loans at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.29% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Company's ALLL decreased $1.0 million or 5.2% to $18.4 million from $19.4 million at December 31, 2020. No credit issues are anticipated with U.S. SBA PPP loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA and the Bank's allowance for loan loss does not include an allowance for U.S. SBA PPP loans.
The provision for loan losses decreased $10.1 million to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net charge-offs also decreased $0.6 million from $2.2 million or 0.15% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.6 million or 0.11% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The Company's general allowance was stable during 2021 increasing modestly $0.1 million from $18.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $18.2 million at December 31, 2021. The stability in the general allowance was primarily due to improvements in some qualitative factors, such as classified assets and past due loans, partially offset by 2021 growth in the higher risk commercial portfolios.
The Company's specific allowance decreased $1.1 million from $1.4 million at December 31, 2020 to $0.3 million at December 31, 2021. The specific allowance is based on management’s estimate of realizable value for impaired loans. During the first quarter of 2021, the Bank sold non-accrual and classified commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans with an amortized cost of $9.1 million, net of charge-offs of $1.4 million, and recognized a loss on the sale of $0.2 million. In the third quarter of 2021, the Bank resolved $7.8 million of non-accrual loans with $0.5 million in charge-offs through a loan sale and a payoff. The Company's resolution of these impaired loans decreased the specific reserve, improved asset quality and improved several ALLL qualitative factors.
Management believes that loans that were part of the COVID-19 deferral program in 2020 and 2021 are more likely to default in the future and that the identification and resolution of specific problem credits could be delayed. Our evaluation of qualitative factors considered previously deferred loans, the length of the deferral period, the type and amount of collateral and customer industries. As of December 31, 2021, there were no COVID-19 deferral agreements compared to $35.4 million or 2.4% of gross portfolio loans at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 there were previously COVID-19 deferred loans of $3.9 million (four relationships - with $3.8 million current and $0.1 million delinquent) deemed to be non-accrual and substandard based on internal reviews. As of December 31, 2020 there were $3.4 million of COVID-19 deferred loans deemed to be non-accrual and substandard. In our evaluation of previously deferred loans, we considered the length of the deferral period, the type and amount of collateral and customer industries.
Management believes that the allowance is adequate at December 31, 2021. The ALLL as a percent of total loans may increase or decrease in future periods based on economic conditions. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on a periodic evaluation of the portfolio. For additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policy section of the MD&A.
The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by portfolio loan category at the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
(1) Percent of loans in each category to total portfolio loans
The following table indicates net charge-offs by average portfolio loan category for the years ended as indicated:
Effective January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model or ASU 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments". Our CECL model has been substantially developed and the third-party model validation is complete. We conducted parallel runs of the CECL loss estimation model and the Company's existing incurred loss model throughout 2021. We are refining our implementation controls and processes of the CECL model. ASU 2016-13 will also require the establishment of an allowance for expected credit losses for certain debt securities and other financial assets.
Management expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as of the January 1, 2022. Based on forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of January 1, 2022, we expect to recognize an increase to the opening allowance for credit losses in the range of $2.0 million to $3.0 million. See the discussion of ASU 2016-13 under Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 for additional information.
Classified Assets and Special Mention Assets
During 2020, classified assets decreased $12.3 million. Asset quality has continued to improve in 2021 with the resolution of $16.9 million in non-accrual and impaired loans through loan sales and negotiated payoffs as well as the resolution of $3.1 million in OREO. Management remains committed to expeditiously resolve non-performing or substandard credits that are not likely to become performing or passing credits in a reasonable timeframe.
Classified assets decreased $17.1 million from $22.4 million at December 31, 2020 to $5.2 million at December 31, 2021. Management considers classified assets to be an important measure of asset quality. The Company's risk rating process for classified loans is an important input into the Company's allowance methodology. Risk ratings are expected to be an important indicator in assessing ongoing credit risks of COVID-19 previously deferred loans. The following is a breakdown of the Company’s classified and special mention assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
Non-Performing Assets
The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s non-performing assets. There were no loans 90 days or more past due that were still accruing interest at the dates indicated.
___________________________________________
(1) Non-accrual loans include all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent and loans that are non-accrual due to the operating results or cash flows of a customer.
(2) TDR loans include both non-accrual and accruing performing loans. All TDR loans are included in the calculation of asset quality financial ratios. Non-accrual TDR loans are included in the non-accrual balance and accruing TDR loans are included in the accruing TDR balance.
Non-accrual loans and OREO to total assets decreased from 1.05% at December 31, 2020 to 0.33% at December 31, 2021. Non-accrual loans, OREO and TDRs to total assets decreased from 1.08% at December 31, 2020 to 0.35% at December 31, 2021.
All interest accrued but not collected from loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. Interest income is recognized on a cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans include certain loans that are current with all loan payments and are placed on non-accrual status due to customer operating results and cash flows. Non-accrual loans are considered impaired and evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis.
At December 31, 2021, there were $6.7 million (88%) of non-accrual loans current with all payments of principal and interest with specific reserves of $0.3 million. Delinquent non-accrual loans were $0.9 million (12%) of with no specific reserves at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, there were $6.3 million (34%) of non-accrual loans current with all payments of principal and interest with no impairment and $12.0 million (66%) of delinquent non-accrual loans with a total of $1.3 million specifically reserved. There were no non-accrual TDRs at December 31, 2021. Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020 included six TDRs totaling $1.5 million. These loans were classified solely as non-accrual for the calculation of financial ratios.
Other Real Estate Owned
The following is a summary roll-forward of OREO activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The decreased OREO valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects management's actions to resolve non-performing assets. There were no OREO balances at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.1 million at December 31, 2020. For additional information on OREO, refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Liabilities
Deposits and Borrowings - Funding
The Bank has access to both retail deposits and wholesale funding. Wholesale funding includes long-term debt and short-term borrowings of advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and brokered deposits. Retail deposits totaled $2.05 billion or 99.0% of funding at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.74 billion or 98.0% of funding at December 31, 2020. In addition to funding for operations, the Company had junior subordinated debentures of $12.0 million and fixed to floating subordinated notes of $20.0 million at 4.75% at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following is a breakdown of the Company’s deposit portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Total deposits increased at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. During the same period, noninterest bearing demand deposits and total transaction deposits increased in dollars and as a percentage of deposits. Customer deposit balances increased in 2021 due to new customer acquisitions as well as lower levels of consumer and business spending related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank has added new customers and lower cost transaction deposits in every year in each of the last six years. Competitors, merger and acquisition activity in our market, the Bank's participation in the SBA US PPP program and focused efforts of our business development teams all contributed to deposit increases in 2021.
For FDIC call reporting purposes reciprocal deposits are classified as brokered deposits when they exceed 20% of a bank’s liabilities or $5.0 billion. Reciprocal deposits increased $128.6 million to $483.5 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $354.9 million at December 31, 2020. Reciprocal deposits as a percentage of the Bank’s liabilities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were 23.1% and 19.6%, respectively. $65.7 million reciprocal deposits were considered brokered at December 31, 2021 and no reciprocal deposits were considered brokered deposits for call reporting purposes as of December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits.
The following table indicates that 17.8% of the Bank’s certificates of deposit and other time deposits, by account, exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently, $250,000), by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2021.
Uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limits, currently set at $250,000 were approximately $496.0 million and $409.1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting.
Note 7 includes the scheduled contractual maturities of total certificates of deposits of $327.4 million at December 31, 2021.
Stockholders’ Equity
The following table shows the Company’s equity and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, stockholders’ equity increased in part due to net income of $25.9 million and net stock related activities in connection with stock-based compensation and ESOP activity of $0.9 million. These increases to stockholders’ equity were partially offset by common stock repurchases of $7.0 million, common dividends paid of $3.2 million, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $6.5 million.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had a book value of $36.40 per common share compared to $33.54 at December 31, 2020. The Company’s tangible book value was $34.32 at December 31, 2021 compared to $31.45 at December 31, 2020. The Company remains well capitalized at December 31, 2021 with a Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage ratio) of 9.23% compared to 9.56% at December 31, 2020. The Company's common equity to assets ratio decreased to 8.94% at December 31, 2021 from 9.77% at December 31, 2020. The Company’s ratio of tangible common equity ("TCE") to tangible assets decreased to 8.48% at December 31, 2021 from 9.22% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the TCE ratio was due primarily to significant increases in cash and investments. The Company’s Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio was 11.92% at December 31, 2021 compared to 11.47% at December 31, 2020.
In April 2020, banking regulators issued an interim final rule that excluded U.S. SBA PPP loans from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios by assigning a zero percent risk weight.
The ESOP has promissory notes with the Company for the purchase of TCFC common stock for the benefit of the participants in the Plan. Loan terms are at prime rate plus one-percentage point and amortize over seven years. As principal is repaid, common shares are allocated to participants based on the participant account allocation rules described in the Plan. The Bank is a guarantor of the ESOP debt with the Company. Unencumbered shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share. Shares issued to the ESOP but pledged as collateral for loans obtained to provide funds to acquire the shares are not treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, $0.1 million or 4,150 Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") shares were allocated with the payment of promissory notes and there were no offsetting ESOP purchases of shares. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $0.1 million or 4,150 ESOP shares were allocated with the payment of promissory notes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is our ability to fund operations and meet present and future financial obligations through the sale or repayment of existing assets or by obtaining additional funding through liability management. Cash needs may come from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position.
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank’s most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents and federal funds sold. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank’s operating, financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows. Customer deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Bank’s lending and investment activities.
Liquidity is provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors and brokered deposits. Other sources of funds include our ability to borrow, such as purchasing federal funds from correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. The Bank uses wholesale funding (brokered deposits and other sources of funds) to supplement funding when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth and for asset-liability management purposes.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank had $64.0 million and $66.5 million, respectively, in loan commitments outstanding, $22.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit and approximately $242.0 million and $225.5 million, respectively, available under lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $256.9 million or 78.45% and $266.1 million, or 75.21%, respectively, of total certificates of deposit outstanding. If maturing deposits do not remain, the Bank will be required to seek other sources of funds, or use on balance sheet cash and investments. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposits. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
Management has increased oversight and review of customer line of credit usage. If we were to experience increases in draws on customer lines of credit or decreased deposit levels in future periods as a result of the distressed economic conditions in our market areas relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, our level of borrowed funds could increase.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had on-balance sheet liquidity of $139.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2021, the Company had loans and securities pledged or in safekeeping at FHLB which provided for funding availability of $530.5 million at December 31, 2021.
Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB, a portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio and certain investments. Generally, the Bank’s ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta is limited by its available collateral and also by an overall limitation of 30% of assets. FHLB long-term debt consists of adjustable-rate advances with rates based upon LIBOR, fixed-rate advances, and convertible advances. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 100% of the Bank’s long-term debt was fixed for rate and term, as the conversion optionality of the advances have either been exercised or expired. In addition, the Bank has established unsecured and secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and commercial banks. For a discussion of these agreements including collateral see Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Liquidity has improved in the last three years with the increase in transaction deposits and decrease in wholesale funding. The Company’s net loan to deposit ratio was 77.2% at December 31, 2021 compared to 91.3% at December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the average loan to deposit ratios were 83.9% and 94.9%, respectively. The Company intends to use available on-balance sheet liquidity to fund loans, increase investments and limit the use of wholesale funding.
The Bank’s principal sources of funds for investment and operations are net income, deposits, sales of loans, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, principal and interest received on investment securities and proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities. The Bank’s principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans, the purchase of securities and the payment of maturing deposits.
The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Years Ending December 31, 2021 and 2020
During the year ended December 31, 2021, all financing activities provided $285.4 million in cash compared to $209.2 million in cash provided for the same period in 2020. The Company was provided $76.2 million more cash from financing activities compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased deposit growth of $76.8 million. The Company used $2.0 million more cash in 2021 compared to 2020 for net long-term debt activity and short-term borrowings activity used $5.0 million less cash in 2021 compared to 2020. The Company used $7.1 million more in cash for stock related activities in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to $6.7 million increase in common stock repurchased, and an increase in common dividends paid in 2021. The Company used $3.5 million less cash in 2021 compared to 2020 for activity related to subordinated notes.
The Bank’s principal use of cash has been in investing activities including its investments in loans, investment securities and other assets. In 2021, the level of net cash used in investing increased to $256.0 million from $192.7 million in 2020. The increase in cash used was primarily the result of cash used for purchases of investment securities partially offset by a decrease in cash used for loan activities. Cash used for loan activities decreased $167.6 million from $163.3 million, for the year ended for the year ended December 31, 2020 to cash provided of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash used increased as principal received on loans in 2021 decreased over the prior year comparable period primarily due to decreased PPP originations in 2021 compared to the prior year.

Capital Resources
The Company has no business other than holding the stock of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding requirements, except for the payment of dividends on common stock, and the payment of interest on subordinated debentures and subordinated notes, and noninterest expense.
The Company evaluates capital resources by the ability to maintain adequate regulatory capital ratios. The Company and the Bank annually update a three-year strategic capital plan. In developing its plan, the Company considers the impact to capital of asset growth, income accretion, dividends, holding company liquidity, investment in markets and people and stress testing.
Federal banking regulations require the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company and Bank were well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under the Basel III Capital Rules. Management believes, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On March 31, 2015, the Bank made the election to continue to exclude most accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") from capital in connection with its quarterly financial filings and, in effect, to retain the AOCI treatment under the capital rules prior to Basel III.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, letters of credit and lines of credit. For a discussion of these agreements, including collateral and other arrangements, see Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
The Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices within the banking industry, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
