General
We are a leading global designer, producer and marketer of a wide range of electromechanical power transmission motion control (“PTMC”) products. Our technologies are used in various motion related applications and across a wide variety of high-volume manufacturing and non-manufacturing processes in which reliability and precision are critical to avoid costly down time and enhance the overall efficiency of operations.
We market our products under well recognized and established brands, which have been in existence for an average of over 85 years. We serve a diversified group of customers comprised of over 1,000 direct original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) including GE, Honeywell and Siemens, and also benefit from established, long-term relationships with leading industrial distributors, including Applied Industrial Technologies, Grainger, and Motion Industries. Many of our customers operate globally across a large
number of industries, ranging from transportation, turf and agriculture, energy and mining to factory automation, medical and robotics. Our relationships with these customers often span multiple decades, which we believe reflects the high level of performance, quality and service we deliver, supplemented by the breadth of our offering, vast geographic footprint and our ability to rapidly develop custom solutions for complex customer requirements.
On October 1, 2018, Altra consummated the Fortive Transaction and acquired the A&S Business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which consisted of $1,400.0 million of cash and debt instruments transferred to Fortive and shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. The initial accounting for the Fortive Transaction (including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities) was completed during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Business Outlook
Our future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on conditions in the U.S., European, and global economies in general. In the year ended December 30, 2021, our team was required to manage through a challenging environment, including supply chain constraints, labor shortages, inflation pressures, and the continued impact of COVID-19. Despite these challenges, our businesses experienced broad-based demand trends which contributed to strong backlog levels. Moreover, our strong cash generation allowed us to make continued progress de-levering our balance sheet by paying down a total of $155 million of debt in 2021.
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect continued strength across most of our end markets. We enter the year with strong backlog levels and have implemented several pricing initiatives that we expect will improve profitability in the coming quarters. However, we anticipate the first half of 2022 will continue to be constrained by headwinds from inflation, labor availability and supply chain challenges. We will remain focused on leveraging the Altra Business System to drive organic growth initiatives, to integrate the Nook business, and to execute on our strategy to position Altra as a resilient premier industrial company for the long-term.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based upon historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements.
Inventory. Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead. We state inventories acquired through acquisitions at their fair value at the date of acquisition based on the replacement cost of raw materials, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts, and, for work-in-process, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts and costs to complete.
We periodically review our quantities of inventories on hand and compare these amounts to the historical and expected usage of each particular product or product line. We record as a charge to cost of sales any amounts required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to net realizable value.
We record an inventory excess and obsolescence reserve for obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory. In calculating our inventory excess and obsolescence reserve, we analyze historical and projected data regarding customer demand within specific product categories and make assumptions regarding economic conditions within customer specific industries, as well as product changes. Our accounting estimate related to inventory excess and obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because our assumptions are based on factors that can be variable and largely beyond our control, and changes in our reserve for inventory excess and obsolescence could materially affect our results of operations.
Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The accounting for business combinations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities
acquired. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets
Goodwill, Intangibles and other long-lived assets. In connection with our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value. We recorded intangible assets for customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, product technology, patents, in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and goodwill. In valuing the customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and product technology, we utilized variations of the income approach. The income approach was considered the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. The income approach relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. Projected financial information is subject to risk if our estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to our projected revenues and profitability. If we do not meet the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations then the intangible assets could be impaired. In determining the value of customer relationships, we reviewed historical customer attrition rates which were determined to be approximately 1% - 12% per year. Most of our customers tend to be long-term customers with very little turnover. While we do not typically have long-term contracts with customers, we have established long-term relationships with customers which make it difficult for competitors to displace us. Additionally, we assessed historical revenue growth within our industry and customers’ industries in determining the value of customer relationships. The value of our customer relationships intangible asset could become impaired if future results differ significantly from any of the underlying assumptions. This could include a higher customer attrition rate or a change in industry trends such as the use of long-term contracts which we may not be able to obtain successfully. Customer relationships and product technology and patents are considered finite-lived assets, with estimated lives ranging from 4 to 29 years. The estimated lives were determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95% of the value of the discounted cash flows of the respective intangible asset.
Goodwill, trademarks, IPR&D and the majority of our trade names are considered indefinite lived assets. Our trade names and our trademarks identify us and differentiate us from competitors, and therefore competition does not limit the useful life of these assets. Additionally, we believe that our trade names and trademarks will continue to generate product sales for an indefinite period.
Accounting standards require that an annual goodwill impairment assessment be conducted at the reporting unit level using either a quantitative or qualitative approach. The Company has determined that its Power Transmission Technologies (“PTT”) reporting segment is comprised of three reporting units. The Company has also determined that its A&S Business reporting segment is comprised of four reporting units.
In connection with the Company’s annual impairment review, goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company’s measurement date is October 31st. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow model and, where appropriate, the Company also uses the market approach. The determination of the fair value using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, profit margins, and discount rates. The determination of the fair value using the market approach requires management to make significant assumptions related to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiples. The Company estimates future cash flows based upon historical results and current market projections, discounted at a market comparable rate. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeded its deemed fair value.
Management believes the preparation of revenue and profitability growth rates for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate requires significant use of judgment. If any of our reporting units do not meet our forecasted revenue and/or profitability estimates, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis in future periods. In addition, if our discount rate increases, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.
For our indefinite lived intangible assets, mainly trademarks, we estimate the fair value by first estimating the total revenue attributable to the trademarks. Second, we estimate an appropriate royalty rate using the return on assets method by estimating the required financial return on our assets, excluding trademarks, less the overall return generated by our total asset base. The return as a percentage of revenue provides an indication of our royalty rate. We compared the estimated fair value of the trademarks with the carrying value of the trademarks and did not identify any impairment as of the annual impairment date or for any of the periods presented.
Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, and is charged to results of operations at that time.
Management continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value. While management believes the judgements and assumptions used in the impairment tests are reasonable, management considers it a critical accounting estimate because different assumptions or changes in general industry and economic conditions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the financial statements. Refer to Note 7 for additional discussion and results of the Company’s annual impairment review.

Results of Operations.
Amounts in millions, except percentage data
Segment Performance.
Amounts in millions, except percentage data
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Sales. The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to strength across most end markets, especially the turf and garden, factory automation, fork-lift truck and agriculture end markets. Changes in foreign exchange and price had a favorable impact on net sales of $37.6 million and $30.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gross profit. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to increasing costs associated with logistics, supply chain and labor. In addition, we experienced unfavorable product mix in 2021 due to slowness in China for class 8 heavy duty trucks and strong COVID-19 related medical sales in 2020. Changes in foreign exchange and price had a favorable impact on gross profit of $14.2 million and $30.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by expenses returning that were eliminated, reduced or deferred in the prior year such as reinstating merit increases, increased healthcare expenses and backfilling open positions. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on SG&A of $5.7 million.
Research and development expenses. The increase in R&D during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to expenses returning that were deferred, such as reinstating merit increases and backfilling open positions. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect research and development costs to be approximately 2.5% - 3.5% of sales in future periods.
Restructuring costs. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, we commenced a restructuring plan (“2017 Altra Plan”) as a result of Altra’s purchase of Stromag (the “Stromag Acquisition”) and to rationalize our global renewable energy business. The actions taken pursuant to the 2017 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and the elimination of certain costs. The total 2017 Altra Plan savings are in line with our expectations. We do not expect to incur any additional material costs as a result of the 2017 Altra Plan.
During 2019, we commenced a restructuring plan (“2019 Altra Plan”) to drive efficiencies, reduce the number of facilities and optimize our operating margin. We have incurred and expect to incur expenses related to workforce reductions, lease termination costs and other facility rationalization costs. We expect to incur an additional $1 - $2 million in restructuring expenses under the 2019 Altra Plan over the next 2 years, primarily related to plant consolidation and headcount reductions. We achieved savings of $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 under the 2019 Altra Plan and estimate additional future savings to be approximately $1 - $2 million over the next 2 years. The cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2021 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and cost of sales of approximately $1.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
Interest expense. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of the 2018 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) of approximately $15.4 million of non-cash interest expense. In addition, in connection with the new Credit Agreement (as defined below), we reclassified the remaining balance of the unrealized loss from the termination of the interest rate swap from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense of approximately $14.9 million of non-cash interest expense. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in cash interest expense due to the impact of debt paydowns of approximately $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and $5.0 million under the new Credit Agreement. We expect our interest expense in 2022 to continue to decrease as additional principal payments on our debt are made.
(Benefit)/Provision for income taxes. The benefit for income tax as a percentage of income before income taxes increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision for income tax as a percent of income before income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020 was impacted by a $139.1 million non-cash impairment charge recorded at the JVS reporting unit in the United States and China. The benefit for income tax as a percent of income before income taxes during the year ending December 31, 2021 was impacted by a $142.4 million non-cash impairment charge recorded related to the classification of the JVS business as an asset held for sale and by a $2.8 million provision related to disallowed executive compensation. We expect our provision for income taxes before discrete items to be approximately 21% to 23% in future periods.
Segment Performance
Power Transmission Technologies
Net sales in the Power Transmission Technologies segment were $924.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $106.2 million or 13.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the broad based strength across most of our end markets, especially the material handling, turf and garden and agriculture end markets. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2021 had a favorable impact on net sales of $19.6 million. Price had a favorable impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $21.6 million. Segment operating income increased by approximately $31.1 million compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and was partially offset by increasing costs from logistics, supply chain and labor.
Automation & Specialty
Net sales in the Automation & Specialty business segment were $979.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $67.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in the factory automation and marine end markets. Changes in foreign exchange and price had a favorable impact on net sales of $18.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was partially offset by a decline in the heavy-duty truck end market and the medical end market. The A&S segment had a loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the non-cash impairment charge of $142.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 at the JVS reporting unit related to the held for sale classification. Similarly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $8.4 million and $139.1 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively. Excluding the impact of these non-cash impairment charges in 2020 and 2021, income from operations would have decreased by approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increasing costs from logistics, supply chain and labor, partially offset by the increase in sales.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We finance our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). At December 31, 2021, we have the ability under the Revolving Credit Facility to borrow an additional $390.2 million subject to satisfying customary conditions. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pensions, dividends and share repurchases.
We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operating activities, together with our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, make amortization payments under the Credit Facilities (as defined herein), fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements. In the event additional funds are needed for operations, we could attempt to obtain new debt and/or refinance existing debt, or attempt to raise capital in the equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that additional debt or equity financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
Notes
On September 26, 2018, Stevens Holding Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Stevens Holding”), announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of Stevens Holding’s 6.125% senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) in a private debt offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Private Placement”). On October 1, 2018, the Private Placement closed, and Stevens Holding sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Primary Notes”) and an unaffiliated selling securityholder sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Selling Securityholder Notes”). The Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes accrues from October 1, 2018, and the first interest payment date on the Notes was April 1, 2019. The Notes may be redeemed at the option of Stevens Holding on or after October 1, 2023, in the manner and at the redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Altra and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.
The unaffiliated selling securityholder received the Selling Securityholder Notes from Fortive prior to the closing of the Private Placement in exchange for certain outstanding Fortive debt held or acquired by the unaffiliated selling securityholder. Stevens Holding used the net proceeds of the Primary Notes to fund a dividend payment to Fortive prior to the consummation of the Merger, and Stevens Holding did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Securityholder Notes.
2021 Altra Credit Agreement
On November 17, 2021, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement” or the "Altra Credit Agreement") with certain subsidiaries of the Company (together with the Company, the “Borrowers”) , the lenders party to the Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the “Lenders”), Bank of Montreal as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), as sustainability structuring agent and collateral agent thereunder, and under the security and guarantee documents for the Lenders, and BMO Capital Markets Corp., Citizens Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders made available to the Borrowers a term loan facility of $400.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility” or "Term Loan" or “Term Loan A”) and a revolving credit facility of $1,000.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility” or "Revolver", and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The aggregate proceeds of the Credit Facilities were used to repay in full and extinguish all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money under the 2018 Credit Agreement. The amounts available under the Credit Facilities are to be available for general corporate purposes and to repay existing indebtedness. The stated maturity of both of the Credit Facilities is November 17, 2026, and there are scheduled quarterly principal payments due on the outstanding amount of the Term Loan Facility.
The Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company (each a “Guarantor” and collectively the “Guarantors”; the Guarantors collectively with the Borrowers, the “Loan Parties”).
The amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities are due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under either of the Credit Facilities may be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities is calculated using either a Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margins for Eurocurrency Loans are between 1.000% to 1.750%, and for Base Rate Loans are between 0.000% and 0.750%. The amounts of the margins are calculated based on the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). A portion of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies. The interest rate on the Credit Facilities was 1.590% at December 31, 2021.
Revolving borrowings and issuances of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults.

2018 Altra Credit Agreement
On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “2018 Credit Agreement”) with certain subsidiaries of Altra, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The 2018 Credit Agreement provided for a seven-year senior secured term loan to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $1,340.0 million (the “2018 Term Loan Facility”) and a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility available to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in an aggregate committed principal amount of $300.0 million (the “2018 Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the 2018 Term Loan Facility, the “2018 Credit Facilities”). The initial proceeds of the 2018 Term Loan Facility were used to (i) consummate the Direct Sales, (ii) repay in full and extinguish all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money under the Company’s previous credit agreement and (iii) pay certain fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the consummation of the Fortive Transaction. Any proceeds of the 2018 Term Loan Facility not so used could be used for general corporate purposes and the proceeds of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility were used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
The 2018 Credit Facilities were guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and by each direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiary of the Company, subject to certain customary exceptions.
Interest on the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility was calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurocurrency Rate, plus the applicable margin. In addition, the Company was required to pay fees per annum on the unused amount of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the applicable margin.
Revolving borrowings and issuances of letters of credit under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility were subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults.
The 2018 Credit Agreement contained usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, restricted payments, additional indebtedness and asset sales and mergers. In addition, the 2018 Credit Agreement required that the Company maintain a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a specified minimum interest coverage ratio. The obligations of the borrowers of the 2018 Credit Facilities under the 2018 Credit Agreement also contained customary events of default.
Working Capital Line of Credit
One foreign subsidiary of the Company has a line of credit used for operating purposes. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 1.9 million Chinese RMB, or $0.3 million, outstanding on the line of credit.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in millions) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Cash Flows for 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $217.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $45.5 million as compared to the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided was primarily due to unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $102.4 million, which reflect timing difference between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. The decrease was offset by net income of $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a $142.4 million non-cash held for sale impairment charge, a $25.7 million non-cash amortization of interest rate swap expense, and a $15.4 million non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt.
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $179.2 million as compared to the prior year. The increase in net cash used was primarily due to the purchase of Nook Industries for $125.2 million, net of cash acquired, as well as increase in property, plant and equipment purchases. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020 we terminated our cross-currency interest rate swap and received proceeds of $56.2 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $140.7 million as compared to the prior year. The decrease in net cash used was primarily due to borrowings and paydowns on our debt during 2021 as compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $1,030.0 million on our Term Loan B Facility offset by borrowings under our new Credit Agreement of $1,010.0, to which we repaid $5.0
million on our Revolving Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year paydown of $160.0 million. Total debt paid in 2021 was $155.0 million, which was offset by $130.0 million borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of Nook Industries.
We intend to use our remaining cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations to provide for our working capital needs, to fund potential future acquisitions, to service our debt, including principal payments, for capital expenditures, for pension funding, and to pay dividends to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $168.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs. Furthermore, the existing cash balances and the availability of additional borrowings under our Altra Credit Facilities provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.
Capital Expenditures
We made capital expenditures of approximately $40.6 million and $33.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures during 2021 was due to purchases returning that were eliminated, reduced or deferred in the prior year related to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These capital expenditures will support on-going business needs. In 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $45.0 million to $50.0 million .
Long-Term Cash Requirements
Our cash requirements greater than twelve months include payments related to our debt obligations and operating and finance leases. Refer to Note 11 Long-Term Debt and Note 4 Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our contractual obligations and the timing of expected future payments.
From time to time, we may have cash funding requirements associated with our pension plans. As of December 31, 2021, there were no funding requirements for 2022 to 2026. These amounts are based on actuarial assumptions and actual amounts could be materially different.
We may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
Stock-based Compensation
The 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) was approved by the Company's stockholders at its 2014 annual meeting. The 2014 Plan provides for various forms of stock-based compensation to our directors, executive personnel and other key employees and consultants. Under the 2014 Plan, the total number of shares of common stock available for delivery pursuant to the grant of awards (“Awards”) was originally 750,000. Shares of our common stock subject to Awards or grants awarded under our prior 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding as of the effective date of the 2014 Plan (except for substitute awards) that terminate without being exercised, expire, are forfeited or canceled, are exchanged for Awards that did not involve shares of common stock, are not issued on the stock settlement of a stock appreciation right, are withheld by the Company or tendered by a participant (either actually or by attestation) to pay an option exercise price or to pay the withholding tax on any Award, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares will again be available for Awards under the 2014 Plan. An amendment to the 2014 Plan to, among other things, make an additional 2,200,000 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders on September 4, 2018. An additional amendment to the 2014 Plan to, among other things, make an additional 3,000,000 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders at its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders on April 28, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, there were 707.0 thousand shares of unvested restricted stock outstanding under the 2014 Plan. The remaining compensation cost to be recognized through 2024 is $19.8 million. Based on the stock price at December 31, 2021, of $51.57 per share, the intrinsic value of these awards as of December 31, 2021, was $36.5 million.
Income Taxes
We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income, and changes in law. Generally, the tax liability for each legal entity is determined either (a) on a non-consolidated and non-combined basis or (b) on a consolidated and combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated and non-combined affiliated entities. As a result, we may pay income taxes to some jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.
Seasonality
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. In addition, we experience seasonality in our turf and garden business. As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality is also affected by weather and the level of housing starts. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.
Inflation
Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services we use. The majority of the countries that are of significance to us, from either a manufacturing or sales viewpoint, have recently experienced rising inflation, and there can be no assurance that inflation will moderate in future periods. The competitive environment in which we operate inevitably creates pressure on us to provide our customers with cost-effective products and services.
