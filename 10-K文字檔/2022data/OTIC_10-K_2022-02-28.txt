Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for neurotology. We pioneered the application of drug delivery technology to the ear and are utilizing that expertise and proprietary position to develop products that achieve sustained drug exposure from a single local administration. Our primary focus is currently on the advancement of three programs in our broad pipeline: OTO-313 in Phase 2 for tinnitus; OTO-413 in Phase 2a for hearing loss; and OTO-825, a gene therapy for congenital hearing loss, in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling activities. Additionally, we are conducting preclinical development of OTO-510 for otoprotection and OTO-6XX for severe hearing loss. We estimate, based on an external market report commissioned by us, that approximately 28 million people in the United States suffer from moderate to severe tinnitus or hearing loss.
OTO-313 is a sustained-exposure formulation of gacyclidine, a potent and selective NMDA receptor antagonist, in development for the treatment of tinnitus. In July 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OTO-313 in patients with persistent tinnitus of at least moderate severity. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial for OTO-313, with top-line results expected in mid-2022. We are also initiating clinical safety evaluations for higher and bilateral dosing of OTO-313, with top-line results expected in the second half of 2022. If positive, we expect these clinical data to support an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and inform the design of the OTO-313 Phase 3 clinical program planned to start in the first half of 2023.
OTO-413 is a sustained-exposure formulation of BDNF in development for the treatment of hearing loss. In December 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OTO-413 across multiple speech-in-noise hearing tests. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2a cohort for OTO-413, with top-line results expected early in the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, we have initiated enrollment to evaluate higher dosing of OTO-413, with top-line results expected in the second half of 2022. Based on results from the Phase 2a cohort and higher-dose evaluation, we plan to initiate a full dose-ranging Phase 2 efficacy trial by the end of 2022.
OTO-825 is a gene therapy targeting mutations in the GJB2 gene, which is the most common cause of congenital hearing loss. Preclinical proof-of-concept results for OTO-825 demonstrate that a single administration of OTO-825 rescues hearing loss and cochlear damage in two preclinical models representing a range of hearing loss severity caused by GJB2 deficiency. We have completed a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA that provided guidance regarding nonclinical study design, manufacturing requirements and clinical trial considerations. Based on this feedback, we have initiated IND-enabling activities that we expect to support an IND filing in the first half of 2023.
OTO-510 is a product candidate in preclinical development for the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL), which routinely occurs in patients undergoing treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent. OTO-510 has demonstrated improved otoprotection in preclinical studies compared to other drug candidates in clinical development, and is being formulated to provide sustained exposure from a single intratympanic injection. The goal of the OTO-510 program is to preserve hearing without protecting the tumor.
Our OTO-6XX program is evaluating the treatment of severe hearing loss by repairing or regenerating auditory hair cells. In July 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyorin that provides us with exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a novel compound from Kyorin for this program.
We have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2008, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to developing and commercializing OTIPRIO, developing OTIVIDEX and our current product candidates, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. In July 2020, we sold in a public offering 17,275,000 shares of our common stock, which includes the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and we sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,000,000 shares of our common stock for $64.2 million in total net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In April 2021, we sold in a public offering 8,298,890 shares of our common stock, which includes the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and we sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 7,111,110 shares of our common stock for $32.2 million in total net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $77.4 million and an outstanding principal debt balance of $16.0 million.
We have never been profitable, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $555.8 million. Our net losses were $51.2 million, $44.7 million and $44.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 2020 and 2019, respectively. Substantially all our net losses have resulted from research and development expenses related to our clinical trials and product development activities, commercialization expenses to launch OTIPRIO in the U.S. market, and other general and administrative expenses.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop, seek regulatory approval, and, if approved, commercialize our product candidates. In the near term, we anticipate our expenses will continue to be substantial as we:
•conduct clinical development of OTO-313 and OTO-413, and conduct IND-enabling studies of OTO-825;
•conduct preclinical development of OTO-510 and OTO-6XX;
•contract to manufacture our product candidates;
•evaluate opportunities for development of additional product candidates;
•maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio;
•hire additional staff as necessary to execute our product development plan; and
•operate as a public company.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When additional financing is required, we anticipate we will seek funding through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration arrangements. We may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to raise capital could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.
In November 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents of the University of California (UC). Under the license agreement, UC granted us an exclusive license under their rights to patents and applications that are co-developed and co-owned with us for the treatment of human otic diseases. Our financial obligations under the license agreement include development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $2.7 million per licensed product, of which $1.9 million has been paid for OTIPRIO, $0.8 million has been paid for OTIVIDEX, $0.4 million has been paid for OTO-413, and $0.1 million has been paid for OTO-311 (but such milestone payments are reduced by 75% for any orphan indication product), and a low single-digit royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of licensed products. In addition, for each sublicense we grant we are obligated to pay UC a fixed percentage of all royalties as well as a sliding-scale percentage of non-royalty sublicense fees received by us under such sublicense, with such percentage depending on the licensed product’s stage of development when sublicensed to such third party. We have the right to offset a certain amount of third-party royalties, milestone fees or sublicense fees against the foregoing financial obligations, provided such third-party royalties or fees are paid by us in consideration for intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize a licensed product.
In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with DURECT Corporation (Durect), as part of an asset transfer agreement between us and IncuMed LLC, an affiliate of the NeuroSystec Corporation. Under this license agreement, Durect granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under Durect’s rights to certain patents and applications covering our OTO-313 product candidate, as well as certain related know-how. Under this license agreement and the asset transfer agreement, we are obligated to make one-time milestone payments of up to $7.5 million for the first licensed product. Upon commercializing a licensed product, we are obligated to pay Durect tiered, low single-digit royalties on annual net sales by us or our affiliates or sublicensees of the licensed products, and we have the right to offset a certain amount of third-party license fees or royalties against such royalty payments to Durect. In addition, each sublicense we grant to a third party is subject to payment to Durect of a low double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments we receive under such sublicense. Additionally, we are also obligated to pay the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), on behalf of Durect, for a low single-digit royalty payment on net sales by us or our affiliates or sublicensees upon commercialization of the licensed product. The foregoing royalty payment obligation to Durect would continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until expiration or determination of invalidity of the last valid claim within the licensed patents that cover the licensed product, and the payment obligation to INSERM would continue so long as Durect’s license from INSERM remains in effect.
Given the unprecedented and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the rise of new variants, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the progression and ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business operations. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials, including developing processes to ensure the integrity of data collection from enrolled patients and supporting sites’ ability to enroll patients, among other activities. Nonetheless, we do not know the full extent of potential future delays or impacts on our business operations, our preclinical programs and clinical trials, healthcare systems, our financial condition, or the global economy as a whole resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees and community by generally adopting policies in line with directives from the State of California and the applicable local governments, and guidance from the CDC. Various safety protocols have been implemented and we are currently allowing employees who can remotely perform their essential functions to work from home as this was determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate.
Financial Operations Overview
Operating Expenses
Research and development expenses
Our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.
Our research and development expenses include:
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;
•external development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as fees paid to CROs in connection with nonclinical studies and clinical trials, costs of acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data such as investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis, and fees paid to consultants;
•costs to acquire, develop and manufacture clinical trial materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;
•payments related to licensed product candidates and technologies with no alternative future use;
•costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements; and
•facilities expenses which include allocated expenses for amortization of ROU assets, depreciation and other overhead expenses, and direct costs for laboratory and other supplies.
We expense our internal and third-party research and development expenses as incurred.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses (in thousands):
We expect our research and development expenses to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through their respective development programs. The process of conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The probability of success will be affected by numerous factors, including nonclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We are responsible for all of the research and development costs for our programs.
Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each of our clinical development programs and are difficult to predict. We therefore cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs we will incur in connection with development of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future clinical trials, regulatory developments, and our ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidate’s commercial potential. We may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to complete the development of and, if approved, commercialize, our product candidates. We may enter into collaborative agreements in the future in order to conduct clinical trials and gain regulatory approval of our product candidates, particularly in markets outside of the United States. We cannot forecast which programs or product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and overall capital requirements.
The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a program owing to the following:
•per patient trial costs;
•the number of sites included in the trials;
•the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•changes in regulatory and legal requirements for clinical trials;
•the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•the number of doses that patients receive;
•the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;
•the duration of patient follow-up;
•the phase of development of the product candidate;
•the manufacturing process and complexity of, expiration of, and amount of the drug product required for the clinical trials;
•the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate; and
•the impacts of COVID-19.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, as well as other related costs for our employees and consultants in executive, administrative, finance and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development, costs associated with prosecuting and maintaining our patent portfolio and corporate legal expenses, costs required for public company activities and infrastructure necessary for the general conduct of our business, and OTIPRIO product support expenses and profit-sharing fees payable to our co-promotion partners, which are reduced by payments received from them.
We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to be substantial as we support development of our product candidates, and as we incur ongoing expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums, and investor relations-related expenses.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and interest expense related to our long-term debt and finance leases.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to net product sales, accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on our historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Clinical Trial Expense Accruals
We estimate expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, CROs and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts vary and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided.
We record clinical trial expenses in the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. We accrue for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We estimate accruals through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of trials. During the course of a clinical trial, we may adjust our clinical accruals if actual results differ from our estimates. We estimate accrued expenses as of
each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Our clinical trial accruals are dependent upon accurate reporting by CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to differ materially from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 there were no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials.
Stock-based Compensation
We recognize non-cash expense for the fair value of all stock options and other share-based awards. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options, using the single-option award approach and straight-line attribution method. For stock option and restricted stock unit grants, we recognize the fair value as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each respective stock option or restricted stock unit, generally between two and four years.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.
Other Information
Net Operating Loss and Research and Development Tax Credit Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state NOLs of approximately $436.7 million and $127.1 million, respectively. Of our federal NOLs, approximately $196.1 million were generated in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and therefore do not expire. Our remaining U.S. federal and state NOLs will expire in various years beginning in 2030, if not utilized. Under the legislation enacted in 2017 commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), as modified by the CARES Act, the deductibility of our federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will be limited to 80% of taxable income in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $13.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards expire in various years beginning in 2030, if not utilized. The California research credit will carry forward indefinitely. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change federal NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited or eliminated. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5% shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California imposed limits on the usability of California state net operating losses to offset taxable income in tax years beginning after 2019 and before 2023. We believe we have experienced ownership changes in the past and have reduced our deferred tax assets related to NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards accordingly. We are in the process of completing an analysis of ownership changes through December 31, 2021 which could result in substantial limitations in, or the elimination of, our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in the event that we attain profitability.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.
Reduced Reporting Requirements
We are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. For as long as we remain a “smaller reporting company,” we are permitted and intend to continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “smaller reporting companies.” Additionally, we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements available to us as a non-accelerated filer, including those relating to providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Research and development expenses. The increase of $6.7 million in research and development expenses resulted from a number of activities including: (i) a $9.4 million net increase in OTO-313 clinical trial and development costs; (ii) a $1.2 million increase in facilities and other operating expenses mainly due to the impairment of OTIVIDEX manufacturing equipment. The increase in research and development expenses was offset by a $3.9 million decrease in OTIVIDEX costs due to discontinuation of development activities following completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial in early 2021.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent year-over-year.
Interest income. Interest income was consistent year-over-year.
Interest expense. Interest expense was consistent year-over-year.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations” in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $555.8 million and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more public or private equity or debt financings, or other sources such as potential collaboration arrangements. However, additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $77.4 million. We have principally financed our operations through sales and issuances of our equity securities, debt financing as well as private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible notes. Our primary contractual obligations include our facility lease and our term loans.
The following table sets forth a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Operating activities. The primary uses of cash were to fund increased levels of development activities for our product candidates. We expect to continue the use of cash for development of our product candidates for the foreseeable future.
Net cash used in operating activities was $42.4 million in 2021 compared to $38.9 million in 2020. The increase in the utilization of cash was primarily due to an increase in operating losses compared to the prior year period. Net cash used in operating activities was $38.9 million in 2020 compared to $36.9 million in 2019. The increase in the utilization of cash was primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses compared to an increase in the prior year.
Investing activities. The primary source of cash from investing activities was from maturities of short-term investments and the primary use of cash from investing activities was for purchases of short-term investments and capital expenditures.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $56.0 million in 2021 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $20.2 million in 2020 and net cash provided by investing activities of $28.3 million in 2019. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to net maturities of short-term investments used to fund operations. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments.
Financing activities. The primary sources of net cash provided by financing activities were net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities and net proceeds from debt.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $33.1 million in 2021 compared to $64.7 million in 2020 and $0.2 million in 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 consisted of $32.2 million related to the issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants, net proceeds of $0.7 million from a loan and $0.2 million in net proceeds for shares issued upon stock option exercises and under our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 consisted of $64.2 million related to the issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants and $0.5 million in net proceeds for shares issued upon stock option exercises and under our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 consisted of $0.2 million in net proceeds for shares issued upon stock option exercises and under our employee stock purchase plan.
At-the-Market Offering Program
In August 2019, we entered into a sales agreement (Sales Agreement) with Cowen to sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $40.0 million, from time to time, through an “at-the-market” equity offering program under which Cowen will act as sales agent or principal. Under the Sales Agreement, we set the parameters for the sale of shares, including the number or dollar value of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. The Sales Agreement provides that Cowen will be entitled to compensation for its services that will equal 3.0% of the gross sales price per share of all shares sold through Cowen under the Sales Agreement. The Sales Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the issuance and sale of placement shares equaling sales proceeds of $40.0 million and may be terminated earlier by
either us or Cowen upon five days’ notice. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement in connection with an “at-the-market” offering under which we may sell shares of common stock for up to an aggregate of $40.0 million, and entered into a superseding sales agreement with Cowen on terms substantially similar to the Sales Agreement. Through December 31, 2021, we have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement.
Term Loans
Oxford Loans
On December 31, 2018 (the Closing Date), we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC (the Loan Agreement). On June 2, 2021 (the New Closing Date), we entered into the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement (the Third Amendment and together with the Loan Agreement, the Loan Agreements), which amends the Loan Agreement. The Third Amendment was accounted for as a modification. The Loan Agreement provides for a $15.0 million secured term loan credit facility (the Original Term Loan) and the Third Amendment provides for an additional $1.0 million term loan (the New Term Loan and together with the Original Term Loan, the Term Loans). The proceeds of the Term Loans may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. We had the right to prepay the Original Term Loan in whole or in part at any time, subject to a prepayment fee of 1.00%. Under the Third Amendment, we have the right to prepay the Term Loans in whole or in part at any time, subject to a prepayment fee of 3.00% if prepaid on or prior to the first anniversary of the New Closing Date, 2.00% if prepaid after the first anniversary of the New Closing Date and on or prior to the second anniversary of the New Closing Date, and 1.00% thereafter. Amounts prepaid or repaid under the Term Loans may not be reborrowed. The Original Term Loan was fully funded on the Closing Date and the New Term Loan was fully funded on the New Closing Date. The Original Term Loan’s maturity was extended under the Third Amendment from December 1, 2023 to April 1, 2026 (the Maturity Date), and the New Term Loan matures on the Maturity Date. We paid a facility fee of 0.75% of the Original Term Loan and customary closing fees on the Closing Date and customary closing fees in respect of the Third Amendment on the New Closing Date.
The Term Loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 5.25% and the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal from time to time, plus 3.75% (9.0% as of December 31, 2021, the minimum interest rate). Interest on the Term Loans is payable monthly in arrears. We were permitted to make interest-only payments on the Original Term Loan until February 1, 2022, followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal and interest in arrears through maturity on December 1, 2023. Under the Third Amendment, we are permitted to make interest-only payments on the Term Loans until June 1, 2023, followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal and interest in arrears through the Maturity Date. The Third Amendment also permits the interest-only period to be extended by an additional twelve months subject to the achievement of certain milestones. The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on the Maturity Date. The net outstanding balance of the Term Loans was $16.0 million as of December 31, 2021.
Upon repayment or acceleration of the Term Loans, a final payment fee equal to 4.00% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Term Loans is payable (the Final Payment Fee). The Final Payment Fee of $0.6 million, as well as the initial facility fee and all other direct fees and costs associated with the Loan Agreements, was recognized as a debt discount. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan Agreements using the effective interest method.
Our obligations under the Loan Agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property and subject to certain other exceptions and limitations.
The Loan Agreements contain customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding compliance with applicable laws and regulations, reporting requirements, payment of taxes and other obligations, and maintenance of insurance. Further, subject to certain exceptions, the Loan Agreements contain customary negative covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, sell assets, allow a change of control to occur (if the Term Loans are not repaid), make acquisitions, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends or repurchase stock. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the lenders may declare all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Loan Agreements immediately due and payable, increase the applicable rate of interest by 5.00%, and exercise the other rights and remedies provided for under the
Loan Agreements and related loan documents. The events of default under the Loan Agreements include payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, material adverse changes, certain bankruptcy events, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, and judgment defaults.
Funding Requirements
We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we: (i) develop and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates OTO-313, OTO-413 and OTO-825; and (ii) work to develop OTO-510, OTO-6XX and additional product candidates through research and development programs. We are subject to all the risks incident in the development of new therapeutic products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When additional financing is required, we anticipate that we will seek funding through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration arrangements. For example, in August 2021, we filed with the SEC a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3, pursuant to which we may offer debt securities, preferred stock, common stock and certain other securities from time to time up to a maximum aggregate amount of $150,000,000. In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement under such shelf registration statement in connection with an “at-the-market” offering under which we may sell shares of common stock for up to an aggregate of $40.0 million. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any collaboration agreements we enter into may provide capital in the near-term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.
Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:
•the design, initiation, progress, size, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, including OTO-313, OTO-413 and OTO-825;
•the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect;
•the revenue generated by our product candidates, if approved;
•the timing and costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials, nonclinical studies and for commercial sale;
•the cost of building and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any products for which we may receive regulatory approval and commercialize, including related facilities expansion costs;
•the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;
•the potential acquisition and in-licensing of other technologies, products or assets;
•the extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our in-license agreements and the timing of such payments;
•the cost of obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;
•the cost associated with legal and regulatory compliance;
•our need to expand our development activities, including our need and ability to hire and adequately compensate additional employees;
•the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the costs associated with being a public company;
•the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
•the cost of litigation, including potential patent litigation.
If we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
