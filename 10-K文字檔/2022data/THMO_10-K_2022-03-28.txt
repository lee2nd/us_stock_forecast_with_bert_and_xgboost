Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Revenues
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $9,294,000 compared to $9,744,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $450,000 or 5%. The decrease was driven by CAR-TXpress revenues, which declined by $544,000 in 2021 as compared to 2020. The Company sells this product line primarily through its exclusive worldwide distributor for X-Series products, Corning Incorporated. They have indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic has hindered their ability to expand revenue for the product line, as during 2021 it was challenging to do on site demonstrations and other sales activities due to the pandemic. Additionally, Other revenues decrease by $245,000 due to COVID-19 testing kits which the Company sold in 2020 but did not sell in 2021. These decreases were offset by an increase of $313,000 in BioArchive revenues, driven by service revenue and $204,000 in AXP, driven by increased sales to the Company’s distributor in China.
Revenues were comprised of the following:
Gross Profit
The Company’s gross profit was $3,493,000 or 38% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,259,000 or 13% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,234,000 or 177%. The increase was primarily due to an inventory disposition expense of approximately $2,800,000 for the remaining inventory of COVID-19 testing kits purchased from ImmuneCyte incurred in 2020. This change was offset by higher inventory reserves in 2021 of approximately $400,000 driven by BioArchive and X-Series® disposables reserves.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8,515,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $838,000 or 11%. The increase was driven by stock compensation expense, which increased by approximately $1,500,000 primarily due to the accelerated expense for the stock options that were voluntarily surrendered by Company executives and increased consulting expenses of approximately $400,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is offset by a decrease of approximately $350,000 in lower legal expenses primarily due to the absence of expenses related to the Mavericks lawsuit incurred in the prior year, approximately $150,000 less in patent expense, approximately $125,000 less in information technology expense, approximately $100,000 less in fixed asset impairment expense, approximately $75,000 less in severance expense and approximately $65,000 less in investor relations related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $2,209,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2,477,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $268,000 or 11%. The decrease was driven by lower salaries and benefits of approximately $415,000 offset by increased stock compensation expense of approximately $150,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased to $6,103,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $7,908,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a difference of $1,805,000. The decrease is driven an accelerated expense of $2,486,000 for the unamortized debt discount of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the portions of the Revolving Credit Agreement with Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. which were converted in 2020, as compared to no conversions in 2021. This was offset by approximately $660,000 in additional interest expense and debt discount amortization related to the Revolving Credit Agreement with Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. and the $1,000,000 July 2019 convertible note that were incurred in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
The Company recorded a gain of extinguishment of debt of $652,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to the principal and accrued interest for the Paycheck Protection Program loan the Company received in 2020, which was forgiven in the first quarter of 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,280,000 and working capital of $8,616,000. We have primarily financed operations through private and public placement of equity securities and our line of credit facility.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $6,620,000 of cash for operations primarily the result of the net loss incurred during 2021, offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $93,000 as the result of capital purchases. Cash generated in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,832,000.
The Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement with Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had drawn down the full $10,000,000 that is available under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which matures in March of 2023. Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boyalife Group Inc. (USA), which is owned and controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
The Company has incurred historical losses from operations and expects to continue to incur operating losses in the near future. The Company may need to raise additional capital to grow its business, fund operating expenses and make interest payments. The Company’s ability to fund its liquidity needs is subject to various risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company may seek additional funding through debt borrowings, sales of debt or equity securities or strategic partnerships. The Company cannot guarantee that such funding will be available on a timely basis, in needed quantities or on terms favorable to the Company, if at all. These factors and other indicators raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the filing date of this report.
We manage the concentration of credit risk with our customers and distributors through a variety of methods including, pre-shipment deposits, credit reference checks and credit limits. Although management believes that our customers and distributors are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and therefore on our net revenues, cash flows and financial condition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to stock-based compensation, depreciation, fair values of intangibles and goodwill, bad debts, inventories, warranties, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. We believe the following policies are critical and require significant judgement by the Company:
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenues consistent primarily of device sales and service revenue.
Device Sales
Device sales include devices and consumables for BioArchive, AXP, CAR-TXpress and manual disposables. Revenue is recognized when control of the devices passes to the customer, and the Company’s performance obligation has been satisfied.
Service Revenue
Service revenue principally consists of maintenance contracts for BioArchive, AXP and CAR-TXpress products. Devices sold have warranty periods of one to two years. After the warranty expires, the Company offers separately priced annual maintenance contracts. Under these contracts, customers pay in advance. These prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the contract performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenue is recognized based on the following five-step process as outlined in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”: (i) Identify the Contract with the Customer; (ii) Identify Performance Obligations in the Contract; (iii) Determine the Transaction Price; (iv) Allocate the Transaction Price; and (v) Satisfaction of the Performance Obligations (and Recognize Revenue).
Revenues are recorded net of discounts. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net revenues, while the related costs are included in cost of revenues. Most sales are made with FOB origin shipping terms, with title and control of the goods passing to the customer at the time of shipment. Payments from domestic customers are normally due in two months or less after the title transfers, the service contract is executed, or the services have been rendered. For international customers, payment terms may extend up to 120 days. All sales have fixed pricing and there are currently no variable components included in the Company’s revenue.
Generally, all sales are contract sales (with either an underlying contract or purchase order). The Company does not have any material contract assets. When invoicing occurs prior to revenue recognition, a contract liability is recorded (as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet).
Except for limited exceptions, there is no right of return provided for distributors or customers. For distributors, the Company has no control over the movement of goods to the end customer. The Company’s distributors control the timing, terms and conditions of the transfer of goods to the end customer. Additionally, for sales of products made to distributors, the Company considers a number of factors in determining when revenue is recognized. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the payment terms offered to the distributor are considered to be non-standard, the distributor’s history of adhering to the terms of its contractual arrangements with the Company, whether the Company has a pattern of granting concessions for the benefit of the distributor, and whether there are other conditions that may indicate that the sale to the distributor is not substantive.
Inventories
We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first in first out basis. This policy requires us to make estimates regarding the net realizable value of our inventory, including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory. Our determination of excess and obsolete inventory requires judgement, which is based on several factors, including demand forecasts, prior sales history, and industry trends. For disposable items with an expiration date, we consider the remaining shelf life in our analysis. Based on our evaluation, an allowance is recorded for inventory which we believe may ultimately not be sold to customers. We update our evaluation every quarter, increasing or decreasing the allowance based on the most current information available at the time. If our actual demand is less than anticipated, we may be required to take additional obsolete inventory charges, decreasing our gross margin and adversely impacting net operating results.
In addition, we sometimes purchase inventory in large quantities to obtain purchase discounts from our suppliers. This leads to the Company to split inventory between short term and long term. The Company uses judgement and the forecasted demand information available to determine whether inventory should be recorded as long term.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
