ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
You should read this discussion together with our financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results could differ materially from those presently anticipated due to a variety of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this Report.
General
We develop and sell devices that use “spintronics,” a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire, store, and transmit information. We manufacture high-performance spintronic products including sensors and couplers to revolutionize data sensing and transmission. We also receive contracts for research and development and are a licensor of spintronic magnetoresistive random access memory technology, commonly known as MRAM.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In accordance with SEC guidance, those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below.
Investment Valuation
Our investments consist primarily of corporate obligations. We have generally invested excess cash in high-quality investment grade long-term marketable securities with less than five years to maturity. We classify all of our marketable securities as available-for-sale, thus securities are recorded at fair value and any associated unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, is included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” If we judged a decline in fair value for any security to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security would be written down and a charge recognized to net income. The fair values for our securities are determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date and observable prices for similar assets. We consider a number of factors in determining whether other-than-temporary impairment exists, including: credit market conditions; the credit ratings of the securities; historical default rates for securities of comparable credit rating; the presence of insurance of the securities and, if insured, the credit rating and financial condition of the insurer; the effect of market interest rates on the value of the securities; and the duration and extent of any unrealized losses. We also consider the likelihood that we will be required to sell the securities prior to maturity based on our financial condition and anticipated cash flows. If any of these conditions and estimates change in the future, or, if different estimates are used, the fair value of the investments may change significantly and could result in other-than-temporary decline in value, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first in, first out method. Where there is evidence that inventory could be disposed of at less than carrying value, the inventory is written down to the net realizable value in the current period. Additionally, we periodically examine our inventory in the context of inventory turnover, sales trends, competition and other market factors, and we record provisions to inventory reserve when we determine certain inventory is unlikely to be sold. If reserved inventory is subsequently sold, corresponding reductions in inventory and inventory reserves are made. Our inventory reserve was $215,000 as of March 31, 2022 and $230,000 as of March 31, 2021.
Deferred Tax Assets Estimation
In determining the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions to realize the benefit of these assets. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances or reduction of existing allowances quarterly. No valuation allowance was recorded as we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
We had $483,469 of net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2022 and $73,538 as of March 31, 2021. Net deferred tax assets included $88,710 in deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation deductions as of March 31, 2022 and $75,189 as of March 31, 2021.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes the percentage of revenue and year-to-year changes for various items for the last two fiscal years:
Total revenue for fiscal 2022 increased 26% compared to fiscal 2021 due to a 26% increase in product sales and a 36% increase in contract research and development revenue. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased purchases by existing customers, and sales increased in most of our markets and product lines. The increase in contract research and development revenue was due to new contracts..
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 77% for fiscal 2022 from 81% for fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased costs, partially offset by increased prices. Material, labor, and services costs increased significantly in the most recent fiscal year.
Total expenses decreased 2% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to a 8% decrease in research and development expense, partially offset by a 12% increase in selling, general, and administrative expense. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to staffing changes and the completion of certain product development activities. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expense was primarily due to staffing changes and increased employee compensation.
Interest income for fiscal 2022 decreased 22% due to a decrease in our available-for-sale securities and a decrease in the average interest rates on those securities.
The 24% increase in net income in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in total revenue.
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
We believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer demand was less in the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. We believe the impact of the pandemic on our supply chain, however, was significantly more in the year ended March 31, 2022 than in the prior year. Supply-chain shortages may have been exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdowns in China in late fiscal 2022. We expect supply-chain shortages to continue in fiscal 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our liquidity and operating capital requirements are primarily for purchases of raw materials such as foundry wafers, purchases of packaging services, and for the maintenance of work-in-process inventories. We maintain most of our marketable securities as long-term to maximize yield and fund future dividends.
Cash and cash equivalents were $10,449,510 as of March 31, 2022 compared to $10,427,340 as of March 31, 2021. The $22,170 increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to $12,503,679 in net cash provided by operating activities and $7,015,421 net cash provided by investing activities, partially offset by $19,496,930 net cash used in financing activities.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities related to product sales and research and development contract revenue as our primary source of working capital for fiscal 2022 and 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12,503,679 for fiscal 2022 and $13,364,832 for fiscal 2021.
Accounts receivable increased $2,740,548 primarily due to the timing of sales to and payments from customers.
Inventory increased $1,187,858 primarily due to our decisions to increase work in process in order to mitigate longer vendor lead-times.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $1,422,677 due to an $815,783 increase in accrued expenses and a $606,944 increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of vendor payments. The increase in accrued expenses was due to increases in accrued payroll and income taxes payable.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2022 was due to marketable security maturities of $7,500,000 and fixed assets purchases of $484,579.
The $484,579 of fixed asset purchases in fiscal 2022 were a significant increase from $62,727 in fiscal 2021. Purchases in fiscal 2022 were primarily for capital equipment to increase our production throughput and capacity and were financed with cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year depending on our needs and equipment purchasing opportunities.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was due to $19,333,409 in cash dividends to shareholders and $163,521 in repurchases of our common stock.
In addition to cash dividends to shareholders paid in fiscal 2022, on May 4, 2022 we announced that our Board had declared a cash dividend of $1.00 per share of Common Stock, or $4,830,826 based on shares outstanding as of April 29, 2022, to be paid May 31, 2022. We plan to fund dividends through cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. All future dividends will be subject to Board approval and subject to the company’s results of operations, cash and marketable security balances, estimates of future cash requirements, the impacts of supply-chain shortages, the impacts of cost inflation, and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Furthermore, dividends may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
