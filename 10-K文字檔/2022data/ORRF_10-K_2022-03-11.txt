ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain prior period amounts presented in this discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications.
Overview
The results of our operations are highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates. Our profitability for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was influenced by our continued organic growth and ongoing expansion into targeted markets, the acquisitions of Mercersburg and Hamilton, and a continued focus on maintaining strong asset quality. The Company's financial results in 2021 and 2020 reflected the significant impact of the SBA PPP fee income of $16.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively. These and other matters are discussed more fully below.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized charges associated with the consolidation of six branch locations, the discontinuance of three loan production offices, a reduction in back-office real estate and staffing reductions. These actions were initiated due to evolving client preferences for the digital delivery of products and services. The cost reductions resulting from these actions and the consolidation of five branches earlier in 2020, enabled the Company to invest in technology and people to facilitate its continued growth. A charge of $1.6 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020, which included $1.3 million related to branch consolidations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, and follow general practices within the financial services industry. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." In applying those accounting policies, the Company's management is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and, in some cases, may contribute to volatility in our reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which the Company's management applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:
Accounting for loan losses - The loan portfolio is the largest asset on the Company's balance sheet. The allowance for loan losses represents the amount that, in management’s judgment, appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. A provision for loan losses is recorded to adjust the level of the ALL as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay its obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Loans acquired at a discount, that is, in part, attributable to credit quality, are initially recorded at fair value with no carry-over of an acquired entity’s previously established ALL. Cash flows expected at acquisition, in excess of estimated fair value, are recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. Subsequent decreases in the expected principal cash flows require the Company to evaluate the need for additions to the ALL. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows result, first, in the recovery of any applicable ALL and, then, in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining management’s estimates and assumptions could result in changes to those estimates and assumptions and also in adjustment of the ALL, or, in the case of loans acquired at a discount, increases in interest income in future periods. The Company has delayed the implementation of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The implementation deadline of ASU 2016-13 was extended for smaller reporting and other companies until the fiscal year and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company will implement ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023. We expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as of the date of adoption of the new standard.
Accounting for income taxes - The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Due to the complexity of the tax laws, management may make judgments in computing income tax expense, which are subject to varying interpretations by management and the taxing authorities, and could result in changes upon final determination. Income tax expense is based upon income before taxes, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses and credits. Temporary differences may occur as a result of certain income and expense items being reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated, using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate, based on the differences between the tax basis and carrying value of the asset or liability on the financial
statement. The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. Under FASB ASC 740, the Company must apply a more likely than not probability threshold on its tax positions before a financial statement benefit is recognized. A valuation allowance would be recognized if any deferred tax assets were determined to be more likely than not unrecoverable. See Note 8, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data," to the consolidated financial statements for details on our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Valuation methodologies - Management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include derivatives and mortgage servicing assets. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of certain assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of income. Examples include investment securities, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill and core deposit intangible assets.
Readers of the Company's consolidated financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances, business or economic conditions, in order to fairly represent the condition of the Company at that time.
Economic Climate, Inflation and Interest Rates
Preliminary real GDP for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflected an annualized increase of 7.0%. This is an increase from the third quarter 2021 growth rate of 2.3% and annualized growth of 4.3% for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in the fourth quarter was driven by increases in private inventory investment, exports including travel, personal consumption expenditures within healthcare, recreation and transportation, and nonresidential fixed investments in intellectual property products, partially offset by decreases in government spending. Restrictions and disruptions continued due to COVID-19 cases throughout the country. There were decreases in government assistance payments as many federal programs expired or were tapered. For the year 2021, real GDP increased 5.7% compared to a 3.4% decrease in 2020. Although there has been a strong economic recovery in 2021, increased COVID-19 cases, inclusive of the new delta and omicron variants, resulted in labor shortages and an increase in inflation.
The national unemployment rate declined to 3.9% in December 2021, down from 4.8% in September 2021 and from 6.7% in December 2020. There were notable job gains in leisure and hospitality, education, professional and business services, retail trade and transportation and warehousing during the year. The personal consumption expenditures ("PCE") price index increased 6.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with an increase of 5.3% in the third quarter of 2021. For the full 2021 year, the PCE price index increased 3.9% compared to an increase of 1.2% in 2020.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market interest rates had declined significantly, with the 10-year Treasury bond falling for the first time below 1.00% on March 3, 2020; it was at 0.93% on December 31, 2020 and has since recovered to 1.51% as of December 31, 2021. In 2020, in reaction to the increase in market uncertainty, the FRB cut the Fed Funds rates by 150 basis points to 0.25%. In its most recent meeting in January 2022, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee left the Fed Funds rate unchanged; however, with inflation elevating and the labor market recovering, the Committee expects that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the Fed Funds rate. In December 2021, the Committee forecasted at least three 25 basis point rate increases in 2022 and noted that it expects to conclude its asset purchase program as early as March 2022.
It is unknown how long the adverse conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution of new variants will continue and what the complete financial effect will be to the Company. It is reasonably foreseeable that estimates made in the financial statements could be materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including expected credit losses on loans and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an impact to the Company on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during
periods of general inflation. Risks also exist due to supply and demand imbalances, job growth, geopolitical tensions and uncertainty on the course of the COVID-19 virus.
As the Company’s balance sheet consists primarily of financial instruments, interest income and interest expense are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve, as well as the mix of assets and funding. The Company has been able to grow its net interest income by $3.4 million from 2020 to 2021 through the recognition of SBA PPP processing fee income, organic commercial loan growth and a reduction in the cost of funds. Competition for quality lending opportunities and deposits remains intense, which, together with a flattening yield curve, will continue to challenge the Company's ability to grow its net interest margin and to manage its overhead expenses.
Results of Operations
Summary
Earnings in 2021 reflected an increase in net interest income from SBA PPP processing fee recognition, the impact of commercial loan growth, reductions in the cost of funds and a decrease in the provision for loan loss expense.
The Company recorded net income of $32.9 million, $26.5 million and $16.9 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Diluted earnings per share totaled $2.96, $2.40 and $1.61 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net interest income totaled $87.0 million, $83.6 million and $69.3 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, principally reflecting our expanded geographic footprint, organic growth in commercial loans from an expanded sales force as we continued to take advantage of market opportunities, and SBA PPP processing fee income. As previously noted, interest rates increased during 2019, but decreased throughout 2020, contributing to reductions in yields on loans and investment securities and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Asset quality trends continued to exhibit low levels of charge-offs and non-performing loans. The provision for loan losses totaled $1.1 million, $5.3 million and $900 thousand in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, improvement in borrowers' performances and the economic recovery resulted in a reduction in certain qualitative factors, and the COVID-19 related factor. The increase in provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily a result of increased uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Noninterest income totaled $29.2 million, $28.3 million and $28.5 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase from 2020 to 2021 included increases of $1.7 million in wealth management income, $706 thousand in interchange income, $635 thousand in mortgage banking activities, and investment securities gains of $654 thousand due to the sales of $148.4 million of investments securities during 2021. These increases in 2021 were partially offset by gains on the sale of portfolio loans of $2.8 million recorded in 2020. There were no sales of portfolio loans in 2021.
Noninterest expenses totaled $74.1 million, $74.1 million and $77.3 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in certain components of noninterest expenses between 2019 and 2020 reflect the Hamilton acquisition, and the Company's continued focus on aligning its talent and locations with its business model. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.9 million from 2019 to 2020 due primarily to Hamilton and $652 thousand from 2020 to 2021 due to key staff additions to facilitate the Company's continued growth. Occupancy and furniture and fixture costs increased $468 thousand from 2019 to 2020 and $330 thousand from 2020 to 2021. In 2020, the Company incurred $1.3 million in pretax branch consolidation expenses, with $9.0 million incurred in 2019 for pretax merger related and branch consolidation expenses. During 2020, the Company recorded a loss of $736 thousand associated with the sale of an operations facility, and recorded a recovery from settlement on a cybersecurity insurance claim of $486 thousand.
Income tax expense totaled $8.0 million, $6.0 million and $2.7 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, or an effective tax rate of 19.6%, 18.6% and 13.8% respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate is less than the 21% federal statutory rate, principally due to tax-free income, which includes interest income on tax-free loans and securities and income from life insurance policies, federal income tax credits, and the impact of non-tax deductible expenses, including merger related expenses. The difference in the effective tax rate in 2021 from prior years was primarily due to an increase in earnings before income taxes.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the primary component of the Company's net income. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and federal funds sold. Interest-bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowed funds.
Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the composition of those assets and liabilities. “Net interest spread” and “net interest margin” are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income. Net interest spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning asset balances.
The FRB influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. The Company's loan portfolio is affected by changes in the prime interest rate. In 2019, 25 basis point reductions in the prime rate occurred in August, September and October and the prime rate ended the year at 4.75%. In March 2020, the prime rate was reduced by 150 basis points and ended at 3.25% in 2020. The prime rate remained at that level throughout 2021.
Core deposits are deposits that are stable, lower cost and generally reprice more slowly than other deposits when interest rates change. Core deposits, which exclude certificates of deposit, are typically funds of local clients who also have a borrowing or other relationship with the Bank. The Company is primarily funded by core deposits, with noninterest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment.
The following table presents net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 21% federal corporate tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019, reflecting our statutory tax rates for those years.
NOTES TO ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME:
(1) Yields and interest income on tax-exempt assets have been computed on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% tax rate.
(2) Average balances include nonaccrual loans.
(3) Interest income on loans includes prepayment and late fees.
(4) For the year ended December 31, 2019, expenses associated with the early redemption of brokered time deposits totaled $0.2 million and increased the cost of funds by five basis points.
The following table presents changes in net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis for 2021, 2020 and 2019 by rate and volume components.
Note: The change attributed to volume is calculated by multiplying the average change in average balance by the prior year's
average rate. The remainder is attributable to rate.
2021 versus 2020
In 2021, net interest income increased by $3.4 million, or 4%, compared with 2020. Net interest income for 2021 on a taxable-equivalent basis increased by $3.4 million, or 4%, compared with 2020. The Company’s net interest spread decreased by twelve basis points to 3.17% for 2021 compared with 2020.
The taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities both decreased from 2020 to 2021, reflecting a decreasing interest rate environment. Average commercial loans increased in 2021 due to SBA PPP loans and commercial loan production. Average balances in taxable investment securities declined as a result of sales and paydowns. Average interest-bearing liabilities declined due to decreased average balances in time deposits and overnight borrowings.
Taxable-equivalent interest income on loans decreased by $3.4 million, or 4%, from 2020 to 2021. The decline resulted from a decrease of 31 basis points in loan yield from 4.56% in 2020 to 4.25% in 2021 due to a decreasing interest rate environment. The impact of the reduced yield was partially offset by the increase in average loans of $56.9 million, or 3%, which was driven by SBA PPP and commercial loan production. Accretion of purchase accounting adjustments included in interest income was $2.3 million, $2.3 million, and $3.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Taxable-equivalent interest income earned on investment securities decreased by $2.7 million, or 21%, from 2020 to 2021, with decreases in both average volume and yield. Average investment securities decreased by $32.3 million, or 7%, and the taxable-equivalent yield decreased by 40 basis points from 2.52% in 2020 to 2.12% in 2021. Sales of taxable securities of $148.4 million between the first and third quarters of 2021 contributed to the decrease in average investment securities. The Company purchased investment securities of $195.0 million during 2021; however, the timing and size of the purchases for the year led to a decrease in the average balance.
Interest expense on deposits and borrowings decreased by $9.3 million from 2020 to 2021, despite an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $49.9 million, or 2%. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined by 47 basis points from 0.80% in 2020 to 0.33% in 2021 due to deposit rate reductions in the first and third quarters of 2021 combined with the continued maturity of higher yielding certificates of deposit and the repayment and maturities of overnight borrowings.
The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $183.9 million, or 10% from 2020 to 2021. Average interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $236.7 million, or 20%, in 2021. Interest expense for interest-bearing demand
deposits decreased by $3.5 million, with the cost of funds decreasing from 0.41% in 2020 to 0.09% in 2021 as a result of deposit rate reductions during 2021, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $4.4 million. Average time deposits decreased $92.0 million, or 20%, in 2021, which reduced interest expense on time deposits by $1.4 million. The cost of time deposits declined by 80 basis points from 1.55% in 2020 to 0.75% in 2021 due to rate reductions.
Interest expense on all borrowings decreased by $1.5 million in 2021 from 2020 due primarily to reduced balances. The average balance of FHLB advances decreased by $138.9 million from 2020 to 2021 due to maturities and repayments, while the average balance of short-term borrowings increased by $4.8 million.
2020 versus 2019
In 2020, net interest income increased by $14.3 million, or 21%, compared with 2019. Net interest income for 2020 on a taxable-equivalent basis increased by $14.1 million, or 20%, compared with 2019. The Company’s net interest spread increased by five basis points to 3.29% for 2020 compared with 2019. Taxable-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and costs of interest-bearing liabilities both decreased from 2019 to 2020, reflecting increased average balances from SBA PPP loans, organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by changes in the interest rate environment between years. Other factors impacting the comparison of taxable-equivalent yields between 2019 and 2020 include the effect of purchase accounting related to the Hamilton acquisition and the timing of our adjustments to rates paid on interest-bearing deposits in response to market demand.
Taxable-equivalent interest income on loans increased by $12.3 million, or 16%, from 2019 to 2020. The increase resulted from SBA PPP loans originated in 2020, which drove an increase in average loan volume and a decrease in yield, with average loans increasing $435.7 million, or 29%, and yield decreasing 50 basis points from 5.06% in 2019 to 4.56% in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, SBA PPP loans had an average balance of $318.4 million and an average yield of 3.5%. Accretion of purchase accounting adjustments in connection with acquisitions increased interest income by $2.3 million, $3.8 million and $335 thousand in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Taxable-equivalent interest income earned on securities decreased by $4.7 million, or 27%, from 2019 to 2020, with both average volume and yield decreasing. Average securities decreased by $5.2 million, or 1%, and the taxable-equivalent yield decreased from 3.43% in 2019 to 2.52% in 2020. Contributing to the overall decrease in interest income on securities was a decrease in average securities balances of $5.2 million from 2019 to 2020. This was partially offset by declines in the yield on floating rate securities, which fell as the FRB reduced short-term rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019 and an additional 150 basis points in the first half of 2020.
Interest expense on deposits and borrowings decreased by $7.7 million from 2019 to 2020, despite an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $247.9 million, or 14%. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined by 55 basis points from 1.35% in 2019 to 0.80% in 2020 due to a decline in market interest rates. In addition, there was an increase in non-interest bearing liabilities of $147.5 million, or 63%, from 2019 to 2020 due primarily to the funding of SBA PPP loans in 2020.
The Company's ability to attract new deposits in all categories, but in particular interest-bearing demand deposits, resulted in an increase in average interest-bearing deposits totaling $236.3 million, or 26%, in 2020. Interest expense for these deposits decreased by $3.5 million, with the cost of funds decreasing from 0.90% in 2019 to 0.41% in 2020. The decrease was driven by the decreasing market rates from 2019 through 2020 due to the rate decreases commenced by the FRB.
The Company also increased its average FHLB advances in 2020. Borrowings generally have higher interest rates associated with them than interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense on all borrowings decreased $374 thousand in 2020, with average balances decreasing $9.2 million for short-term borrowings while FHLB advances increased $75.7 million. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased from 1.28% in 2019 to 0.48% in 2020 and the average rate paid on FHLB advances decreased from 2.21% in 2019 to 1.07% in 2020.
Provision for Loan Losses
The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million, $5.3 million and $900 thousand in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In calculating the provision for loan losses, both quantitative and qualitative factors, including the Company's favorable historical charge-off data and economic and market conditions, were considered. Commercial loan growth resulted in the determination that provision expense was required in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The increase in provision from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's loan portfolio as a new qualitative factor was created to address the potential associated risk. The COVID-19 qualitative factor was fully reversed in 2021 based on the sustained performance of the impacted borrowers.

Noninterest Income
The following table compares noninterest income for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
2021 versus 2020
Noninterest income increased by $843 thousand from 2020 to 2021. The Company continues to focus on growth in relationship fee-based revenue for commercial and retail clients. The following were significant factors in that net increase:
•Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $173 thousand due to the lifting of fee waivers implemented in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased deposit account activity associated with the re-opening of the economy in the second quarter of 2021.
•Interchange income increased by $706 thousand due to increased consumer spending upon the re-opening of the economy, expanded distribution of debit cards by the Bank and increased usage by consumers.
•Swap fee income decreased by $554 thousand due to reduced interest from potential clients in a low interest rate environment.
•Wealth management income, which includes both trust and investment management income and brokerage income, grew to $11.5 million, an increase of $1.7 million, from 2020 to 2021. Strong market conditions and the addition of new clients continue to drive growth in the wealth management business. Assets under management have increased by $149.1 million to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020.
•Mortgage banking income increased by $635 thousand from 2020 to 2021 due primarily to mortgage servicing right valuation allowance reversals in 2021, partially offset by reduced gains on sale in 2021. There was higher refinancing activity during 2020 and into the first half of 2021. Due to market conditions, the margins and production declined, which resulted in a reduced pipeline at December 31, 2021. Mortgage loans sold totaled $200.8 million in 2021 compared with $205.2 million in 2020, and as of December 31, 2021, the Bank serviced $502.5 million of residential mortgage loans, which is up by $61.4 million from December 31, 2020.
•Gains on sale of portfolio loans decreased by $2.8 million from 2020 to 2021. During 2020, the Bank recorded $2.8 million in gains due to the sale of $10.9 million of classified loans for a net gain of $2.5 million and the sale of an $11.0 million portfolio of recreational vehicle loans for a gain of $314 thousand.
•Other income increased by $298 thousand from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to gains recorded on the sales of two shuttered properties in 2021.
•Investment securities gains increased by $654 thousand from 2020 to 2021. During 2021, the Company recorded net investment securities gains of $638 thousand from the sales of $148.4 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. There were no sales of debt securities during 2020.
2020 versus 2019
Noninterest income decreased by $230 thousand from 2019 to 2020. The Company continues to focus on growth in relationship fee-based revenue for commercial and retail clients. The following were significant factors in that net decrease:
•A decline of $530 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts reflects the impact of COVID-19, as the Company waived certain fees for a period of time and experienced an overall decline in account usage.
•Interchange income reflected an overall increase in our clients' activity and card usage due to COVID-19.
•Mortgage banking income increased by $2.2 million due to an increase in loans sold to $205.2 million in 2020 from $106.7 million in 2019 as interest rate declines led to significant refinancing activity.
•Swap fee income declined by $350 thousand from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, the Bank began entering into interest rate swap agreements directly with its commercial customers. This offering replaced the third-party swap transactions initiated in the prior year. This fee revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but client demand to fix loan interest rates declined slightly in the current rate environment.
•Trust and brokerage income reflected increased revenue from strong stock market performance.
•Income from life insurance included death benefit proceeds of $58 thousand in 2020 and $255 thousand in 2019.
•During 2020, the Bank recorded $2.8 million in gains due to the sale of $10.9 million of classified loans for a net gain of $2.5 million and the sale of an $11.0 million portfolio of recreational vehicle loans for a gain of $314 thousand.
•There was a decline of $4.8 million in investment gains from 2019 to 2020 due to prior year asset/liability management strategies, which resulted in net gains of $4.8 million on sales of securities, as market conditions presented opportunities to improve responsiveness of the portfolio to interest rate conditions.
Noninterest Expenses
The following table compares noninterest expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
2021 versus 2020
Noninterest expenses increased by $61 thousand from 2020 to 2021. The following were significant factors within that net increase:
•Salaries and employee benefit expense increased by $652 thousand due primarily to performance-based incentive compensation earned from strong individual production, the Company exceeding targets and other employee incentives. There were also additions to staff in 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by a decrease in employee medical benefits that resulted from favorable claims history.
•Data processing expense increased by $487 thousand due primarily to increased core system costs, investments in new technology and trust data processing activity.
•Advertising and bank promotions increased by $518 thousand due to increased marketing efforts to promote our commitment to the new round of SBA PPP funding in early 2021, followed by increased advertising and promotions in the post-pandemic environment.
•FDIC insurance expense increased by $130 thousand due to increases in the FDIC assessment base driven by the rise in the Bank's average total assets in 2021, an increase in the assessment rate due to commercial loan growth and credits received in 2020 that did not recur in 2021.
•Professional services decreased by $565 thousand due to higher legal costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the reimbursement of the Company's underwriters in connection with the SEPTA litigation.
•Taxes other than income increased by $177 thousand due to an increase in the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax expense that was impacted by an increase in the Bank's total equity balance.
•Intangible asset amortization decreased by $294 thousand principally due to the elimination of a customer intangible associated with the discontinuance of Wheatland on July 31, 2020 and full amortization of a covenant not to compete in 2020.
•Branch consolidation expenses were $1.3 million in 2020 related to the branch and loan product office consolidations. There were no similar charges in 2021.
•In 2020, the Company recorded $486 thousand of refunds received from an insurance company related to a 2018 cyber security incident. There were no such refunds in 2021.
•Other operating expenses decreased by $639 thousand from 2020 to 2021. The reserve for unfunded commitments was reduced by $454 thousand in 2021 due to reductions in qualitative factors, which were previously elevated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also in 2021, certain loss rate assumptions were reduced following a review of historical loss and line utilization experience. In 2020, there was a write-down of $544 thousand in the carrying value of a property held for sale and an impairment charge of $152 thousand on a customer list intangible asset due to the discontinuance of Wheatland. These did not recur in 2021. Partially offsetting these expense reductions was a loss of $514 thousand in 2021 as compared to a gain of $226 thousand in 2020 from the termination of cash flow hedge derivatives. Other normal fluctuations are in the ordinary course of business.
2020 versus 2019
Noninterest expenses decreased by $3.2 million from 2019 to 2020. The following were significant factors in that net decrease:
•The salaries and employee benefit increase includes the impact in 2020 of additional employees, including new client-facing employees in new branches in targeted expansion markets and others that were hired throughout 2019, as well as additional new relationship managers. Higher costs in 2020 also include annual merit and incentive compensation increases in 2020, increased stock compensation expense from additional share-based awards granted in 2020, and higher medical costs for claims activity and the expanded workforce.
•Occupancy expense in 2020 reflects a full period of expense for our expanded presence in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with two branch banking locations added in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, lease termination costs of $588 thousand were recognized in 2020 as a part of the Company's restructuring plan.
•Advertising and bank promotions expense declined from 2019 to 2020 due to additional costs incurred in 2019 for the celebration of the Bank's 100th anniversary year, as well as marketing associated with the acquisitions.
•FDIC insurance expense reflects credits received in the second half of 2019 under the FDIC's regulations to provide credits, when the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, to banks with consolidated assets below $10 billion. FDIC insurance expense increased in 2020 after the remaining credits were used to partially offset first quarter 2020 expense.
•In 2020, branch consolidation costs totaled $1.3 million and there were no merger related costs. These costs primarily represented lease termination costs. Merger related costs incurred in 2019 totaled $8.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded $1.0 million in expenses associated with the announced consolidation of five branches into other, larger Bank branches, which was completed in January 2020. The expenses principally represented owned real estate write downs, lease termination costs, severance benefits for impacted employees and other branch exit related expenses.
•The insurance claim receivable (recovery) write off relates to an expense recorded in 2019 to write off an insurance claim receivable from a 2018 cyber security incident, net of an initial insurance reimbursement. In 2019, the Company received reimbursement totaling $59 thousand for the write off. In February 2020, the Company received an additional $486 thousand reimbursement from the insurance company in a final settlement of the matter.
•Other line items within noninterest expenses are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the ordinary course of business.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense totaled $8.0 million, $6.0 million and $2.7 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2021 was 19.6% compared with 18.6% for 2020 and 13.8% for 2019. Generally, the Company’s effective tax rate is less than the 21% federal statutory rate, principally due to tax-free income, which includes interest income on tax-free loans and investment securities and income from life insurance policies, federal income tax credits, and the impact of non-tax deductible expenses, including merger related expenses. The differences in the effective tax rate in 2021 and 2020 from prior years was primarily due to higher levels of pre-tax income. In 2019, the Company's effective tax rate included benefits realized from a $185 thousand expense reduction related to a favorable tax law clarification on the treatment of life insurance assets of an acquired entity, as well as a $334 thousand expense reduction related to an increase in deferred state income taxes due to a state tax rate change resulting from the Hamilton acquisition.
Note 8, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," includes a reconciliation of our federal statutory tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate, which is a meaningful comparison between years and measures income tax expense as a percentage of pretax income.
Financial Condition
Management devotes substantial time to overseeing the investment of funds in loans and securities and the formulation of policies directed toward the profitability and management of the risks associated with these investments.
Investment Securities
The Company utilizes available for sale securities to manage interest rate risk, to enhance income through interest and dividend income, to provide liquidity and to collateralize certain deposits and borrowings.
The Company has established investment policies and an asset management policy to assist in administering its investment portfolio. Decisions to purchase or sell these securities are based on economic conditions and management’s strategy to respond to changes in interest rates, liquidity, pledges to secure deposits and repurchase agreements and other factors while trying to maximize return on the investments. The Company may segregate its investment portfolio into three categories: “securities held to maturity,” “trading securities” and “securities available for sale.” At December 31, 2021 and 2020, management has classified the entire investment securities portfolio as available for sale, which is accounted for at current market value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in OCI, net of income taxes.
The Company's investment securities portfolio includes debt investments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risks, which arise from general market conditions, and factors impacting specific industries, as well as news that may impact specific issues. Management monitors its debt securities, using various indicators in determining whether a debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired, including the amount of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position, and the cause and extent of the unrealized loss. In addition, management assesses whether it is likely we will have to sell the security prior to recovery, or if we are able to hold the security until the price recovers. For those debt securities in which management concludes the security is other-than-temporarily impaired, it recognizes the credit component of an OTTI impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in OCI. The Company did not record any OTTI expense in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
The following table summarizes the fair value of available for sale securities at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The Company increased its investment portfolio at December 31, 2021; however, the average balance of the investment securities decreased from $494.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In 2020, management planned for the loan portfolio to continue to grow and, in part, be funded by monthly cash flows from asset-backed securities and CMOs. In 2021, the Company sold $148.4 million of commercial MBS and asset-backed securities, which were offset by purchases of GSE residential MBS, non-agency CMOs, municipal securities and United States Treasury notes of $195.0 million. Due to improvements in the capital markets, the Company strategically exited its private label commercial CMO portfolio. The external environment, with tightening credit spreads, presented an opportunity to execute these sales in March 2021. Proceeds from the sales were deployed into agency-backed securities and taxable municipal bonds given the elevated level of liquidity. In September 2021, the Company sold certain asset-backed securities to reduce the risk profile of the investment portfolio and improve yields based on the market conditions and interest rate environment.
The following table shows the maturities of investment securities at book value at December 31, 2021, and weighted average yields of such investment securities. Yields are shown on a tax equivalent basis, assuming a 21% federal income tax rate.
The average maturity is based on the contractual terms of the debt or mortgage-backed securities, and does not factor in required repayments or anticipated prepayments. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average estimated life is 34 years for mortgage-backed and CMO securities, and 22 years for asset-backed securities, based on current interest rates and anticipated prepayment speeds.
The following table summarizes the credit ratings and collateral associated with the Company's available for sale security portfolio, excluding equity securities, at December 31, 2021:
Loan Portfolio
The Company offers a variety of products to meet the credit needs of its borrowers, principally commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, retail loans secured by residential properties, and to a lesser extent, installment loans. No loans are extended to non-domestic borrowers or governments.
Generally, the Bank is permitted under applicable law to make loans to single borrowers (including certain related persons and entities) in aggregate amounts of up to 15% of the sum of total capital and excess ALL not included in Tier 2 capital. The Bank’s legal lending limit to one borrower was $38.0 million at December 31, 2021. No borrower had an outstanding exposure exceeding the limit at year-end.
The risks associated with lending activities differ among loan classes and are subject to the impact of changes in interest rates, market conditions of collateral securing the loans and general economic conditions. Any of these factors may adversely impact a borrower’s ability to repay loans, and also impact the associated collateral. A further discussion on the classes of loans the Company makes and related risks is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
The following table presents the loan portfolio, excluding residential LHFS, by segments and classes at December 31st.
(1) Includes $189.9 million and $403.3 million of SBA PPP loans, net of deferred fees and costs, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 increased by $296 thousand from December 31, 2020 due primarily to commercial loan production, which was offset by SBA PPP loan forgiveness of $442.8 million and reductions in mortgage loans and installment and other loans of $54.6 million in 2021. Overall loan growth, excluding SBA PPP loans, was $213.7 million or 14% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.
From 2019 to 2020, the increase in total loans was due primarily to the origination of SBA PPP loans, which was partially offset by a reduction in mortgage loans resulting from significant refinancing activity in the low interest rate environment. The increase in the loan portfolio from 2018 to 2019 was approximately 75% attributable to loans acquired in the Hamilton transaction. The Mercersburg acquisition in 2018 and Hamilton acquisition in 2019 increased the loan portfolio, principally in the residential mortgage - first lien and commercial real estate - owner and non-owner occupied classes.
The Company's organic growth has occurred in both legacy and newer markets, principally in commercial real estate, but also in commercial and industrial loans as we focused on increasing diversification in the portfolio. The growth in installment and other loans in 2018 and 2019 was principally attributable to purchased automobile financing loans at higher returns than comparable cash flows in the investment securities portfolio.
In addition to monitoring the loan portfolio by loan class as noted above, the Company also monitors concentrations by segment. The Bank’s lending policy reports segment concentrations that exceed 20% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital ("RBC"). The following segments met this criterion at December 31, 2021.
The following table presents expected maturities of loan classes by fixed rate or adjustable-rate categories at December 31, 2021.
The final maturity is used in the determination of maturity of acquisition and development loans that convert from construction to permanent status. Variable rate loans shown above include semi-fixed loans that contractually will adjust with prime or another variable rate index after the interest lock period, which may be up to 10 years. At December 31, 2021, these semi-fixed loans totaled $446.7 million.
Asset Quality
Risk Elements
The Company’s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is managed through the Company's underwriting standards, on-going credit reviews, and monitoring of asset quality measures. Additionally, loan portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to a single industry or borrower, and collateral requirements also mitigate the Company's risk of credit loss.
The following table presents the Company’s risk elements and relevant asset quality ratios at December 31 of each of the years set forth below.
(1) Includes $214 thousand and $456 thousand, respectively, of purchased credit impaired loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, there was one loan for $891 thousand, which was in the process of collection and guaranteed by the SBA.
The following table provides detail of impaired loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate. Risk assets, which include nonperforming assets and restructured and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, totaled $8.5 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.3 million or 28%, from $11.8 million at December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans totaled $6.4 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.9 million from December 31, 2020, which included the payoff of one loan of $2.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in nonaccrual loan amounts also impacted other asset quality ratios detailed above.
The ALL totaled $21.2 million at December 31, 2021, a $1.0 million increase from $20.2 million at December 31, 2020, resulting from a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million and net charge-offs of $61 thousand for 2021. At December 31, 2021, the ALL is higher as a percentage of the total loan portfolio at 1.07% compared to 1.02% in 2020 and 0.89% in 2019. Commercial loan growth drove provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. However, during 2021, the Company fully reversed the prior year's COVID-19 qualitative factor of $2.7 million which partially offset the provision increase from commercial loan growth. In addition. qualitative factors were reduced in the Classified Loans Trends and National and Local Economic Conditions categories, due in part to improved conditions from the pandemic, which were partly offset by an increase in the qualitative factor for Concentrations of Credit caused by significant growth in commercial real estate loans. From December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, special mention loans decreased $63.6 million and substandard loans decreased $7.2 million. The decrease reflects upgrades to commercial loans that were previously downgraded due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Management believes its coverage ratios are adequate for the risk profile of the loan portfolio given ongoing monitoring of the portfolio and its quantitative and qualitative analysis performed at December 31, 2021. As new information is learned about borrowers or updated appraisals on real estate with lower fair values are obtained, the Company may experience an increase in impaired loans.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, recoveries of $1.1 million, $1.2 million and $606 thousand, respectively, were credited to the ALL. These recoveries on previously charged-off relationships are the result of successful loan monitoring and workout solutions. Recoveries are difficult to predict, and any additional recoveries that the Company receives will be used to replenish the ALL. Recoveries favorably impact historical charge-off factors, and contribute to changes in the quantitative and qualitative factors used in our allowance adequacy analysis. However, as the loan portfolio continues to grow, future provisions for loan losses may result.
The Company takes partial charge-offs on collateral-dependent loans when carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, as determined by the most recent appraisal adjusted for current (within the quarter) conditions, less costs to dispose. Impairment reserves remain in place if updated appraisals are pending, and represent management’s estimate of potential loss.
The following table presents exposure to relationships with an impaired loan balance, which excludes accruing PCI loans, and the partial charge-offs taken to date and specific reserves established on those relationships at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Internal loan reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of $1.0 million, which includes confirmation of risk rating by an independent credit officer. In addition, all commercial relationships greater than $500 thousand rated Substandard, Doubtful or Loss are reviewed and corresponding risk ratings are reaffirmed by the Bank's Problem Loan Committee, with subsequent reporting to the Management ERM Committee.
In its individual loan impairment analysis, the Company determines the extent of any full or partial charge-offs that may be required, or any reserves that may be needed. The determination of the Company’s charge-offs or impairment reserve include an evaluation of the outstanding loan balance and the related collateral securing the credit. Through a combination of collateral securing the loans and partial charge-offs taken to date, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for the potential losses that it may incur on these relationships at December 31, 2021. However, over time, additional information may result in increased reserve allocations or, alternatively, it may be deemed that the reserve allocations exceed those that are needed.
The Company’s foreclosed real estate balance at December 31, 2021 was zero for both residential and commercial properties. During 2021, no expense was recorded for the write-down of other real estate owned properties.
In an effort to assist clients which were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank offered various mitigation options, including a loan payment deferral program. Under this program, most commercial deferrals were for a 90-day period, while most consumer deferrals were for a 180-day period. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had loan deferrals under this program for commercial and consumer clients with a total loan balance of zero and $56 thousand, respectively, compared to $15.7 million and $2.5 million for commercial and consumer clients as of December 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease from 2020 to 2021 reflects the majority of loans exiting COVID-19 modification on the basis of upgraded risk rating, payment status and debt service coverage. In accordance with the revised Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications by Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus issued on April 7, 2020, these deferrals are exempt from TDR status as they meet the specified requirements. Below is a summary of select loan concentrations and the deferrals within those categories at December 31, 2021.
The following table summarizes COVID-19 related modifications, including deferrals and forbearances:
Credit Risk Management
Allowance for Loan Losses
The Company maintains the ALL at a level deemed adequate by management for probable incurred credit losses. The ALL is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses which is charged to earnings. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the adequacy of the ALL utilizing a defined methodology which considers specific credit evaluation of impaired loans, historical loss experience and qualitative factors. Management addresses the requirements for loans individually identified as impaired, loans collectively evaluated for impairment, and other bank regulatory guidance in its assessment.
The ALL is evaluated based on review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience; the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay; estimated value of any underlying collateral; and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. A description of the methodology for establishing the allowance and provision for loan losses and related procedures in establishing the appropriate level of reserve is included in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
The following table summarizes the Company’s internal risk ratings at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Non-Impaired Substandard loans are performing loans, which have characteristics that cause management concern over the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming, or impaired, loans in the future. Generally, management feels that substandard loans that are currently
performing and not considered impaired result in some doubt as to the borrower’s ability to continue to perform under the terms of the loan, and represent potential problem loans. Non-impaired Substandard loans totaled $13.5 million at December 31, 2021.
Additionally, the Special Mention classification is intended to be a temporary classification reflective of loans that have potential weaknesses that may, if not monitored or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company’s position at some future date. Special mention loans represent an elevated risk, but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe, or classified, rating. These loans require inquiry by lenders on the cause of the potential weakness and, once analyzed, the loan classification may be downgraded to Substandard or, alternatively, could be upgraded to Pass. Special mention loans decreased by $63.6 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 due to the recovery in commercial loans previously downgraded due to the economic weakness created by COVID-19, as well as related loan modifications completed in 2020. Any loans with second modifications that are COVID-19 related are classified as special mention.
The following tables, which excludes accruing PCI loans, summarize the average recorded investment in impaired loans and interest income recognized, on a cash basis, and interest income earned but not recognized for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The following table summarizes activity in the ALL for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The following table summarizes asset quality ratios for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The following table details net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding by loan category for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
(1) Average loans exclude loans held for sale.
The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million, $5.3 million, $900 thousand, $800 thousand and $1.0 million for 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, in certain cases, loans were successfully worked out with smaller charge-offs than the reserve established on them. From 2017 to 2019, the Company benefited from organic loan portfolio growth and favorable historical charge-off data combined with relatively stable economic conditions over the periods presented above. In 2017, management determined that a provision expense that offset net charge-offs for the year would maintain an adequate ALL, principally due to a charge-off in connection with one commercial credit downgraded to nonaccrual status during the year. In 2018 and 2019, our continued organic loan portfolio growth was a key factor in the quantitative and qualitative considerations used by management in the determination of the provision expense required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. In 2020, the severe economic impact of COVID-19 on the loan portfolio drove an increase in qualitative assumptions, which were reversed in 2021 as sustained performance was demonstrated after the impacted loans were removed from deferral status or the forbearance period ended. In 2021, the provision for loan loss increase was caused by commercial loan growth and an associated increase in the qualitative factor for Concentrations of Credit due to significant growth in commercial real estate loans. These variations in net charge-offs (recoveries) and provision expense (recovery) resulted in the fluctuations in the ratios presented in the tables above.
See further discussion in the “Provision for Loan Losses” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Also, see Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the COVID-19 qualitative assumptions.
The following table shows the allocation of the ALL by loan class, as well as the percent of each loan class in relation to the total loan balance at December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The following table summarizes the ending loan balance individually or collectively evaluated for impairment by loan class and the ALL allocation for each at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
In addition to the reserve allocations on impaired loans noted above, 10 loans, with aggregate outstanding principal balances of $1.1 million, have had cumulative partial charge-offs to the ALL totaling $320 thousand at December 31, 2021. As updated appraisals were received on collateral-dependent loans, partial charge-offs were taken to the extent the loans’ principal balance exceeded their fair value.
Management believes the allocation of the ALL between the various loan classes adequately reflects the probable incurred credit losses in each portfolio and is based on the methodology outlined in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Management re-evaluates and makes certain enhancements to its methodology used to establish a reserve to better reflect the risks inherent in the different segments of the portfolio, particularly in light of increased charge-offs, with noticeable differences between the different loan classes. Management believes these enhancements to the ALL methodology improve the accuracy of quantifying probable incurred credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Management charges actual loan losses to the reserve and bases the provision for loan losses on its overall analysis.
The largest component of the ALL for the years presented has been allocated to the commercial real estate segment, particularly the non-owner occupied loan classes. The higher allocations in these classes as compared with the other classes is consistent with the inherent risk associated with these loans, as well as generally higher levels of impaired and criticized loans for the periods presented. There has generally been a decrease in the ALL allocated to the commercial real estate portfolio, as the level of classified assets has declined, and historical loss rates have improved as a result of improving economic and market conditions; however, the significant increase in commercial loan production resulted in an increase in provision expense in 2021.
The unallocated portion of the ALL reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected, as well as the risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocation, other potential exposure in the loan portfolio, variances in management’s assessment of national and local economic conditions and other factors management believes appropriate at the time. The unallocated portion of the allowance increased from $218 thousand at December 31, 2020 to $237 thousand at December 31, 2021 and represents 1.1% of the ALL for both periods. The Company monitors the unallocated portion of the
ALL, and by policy, has determined it should not exceed 3% of the total reserve. Future negative provisions for loan losses may result if the unallocated portion was to increase, and management determined the reserves were not required for the anticipated risk in the portfolio.
Management believes the Company’s ALL is adequate based on information currently available. Future adjustments to the ALL and enhancements to the methodology may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions, regulatory guidance, or management’s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates.
Deposits
Total deposits grew by $108.0 million, or 5%, from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2020 to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase in 2021 was primarily due to deposits generated through the SBA PPP originations combined with clients continuing to maintain deposit balances in excess of historical norms. Similarly in 2020, the increase in deposits was due to deposits generated through the SBA PPP and government stimulus. In 2019, the Company acquired $388.2 million in deposits from Hamilton. At December 31, 2019, those acquired accounts totaled approximately $332.0 million. During 2019, brokered deposits were reduced by $110.6 million and subscription service CDs declined by $21.9 million. Organic growth totaled approximately $147.7 million in 2019.
The following table presents average deposits for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Average total deposits increased $345.0 million, or 16%; however, average time deposits decreased $92.0 million, or 20.3%, from 2020 to 2021. SBA PPP loan funding was the principal driver of this increase in total deposits.
In addition to deposits from acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, the Bank has been able to garner organic growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit relationships from enhanced cash management offerings as we continued to develop commercial relationships. We also continued to grow core funding deposits through marketing campaigns and improvement in our product delivery with investments in technology and increased sales efforts. We have also been able to increase interest-free funds as we expanded our commercial loan portfolio.
The Bank's brokered deposit balances remained at zero at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and averaged zero for 2021 compared with $3.2 million for 2020. Given interest rate conditions and asset/liability strategies, the Bank borrowed additional funds from FHLB of Pittsburgh to replace called brokered deposits from the second half of 2019 through 2020.
Management evaluates its utilization of brokered deposits, taking into consideration the interest rate curve and regulatory views on non-core funding sources, and balances this funding source with its funding needs based on growth initiatives. The Company anticipates that as loan growth increases, it will be able to generate core deposit funding by offering competitive rates.
The Company has time deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 of $44.0 million and $61.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the scheduled maturities of time deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit or otherwise uninsured were as follows:
Borrowings
In addition to deposit products, the Company uses short-term borrowing sources to meet liquidity needs and for temporary funding. Sources of short-term borrowings include the FHLB of Pittsburgh, federal funds purchased, and to a lesser extent, the FRB discount window. Short-term borrowings also include securities sold under agreements to repurchase with deposit clients, in which a client sweeps a portion of a deposit balance into a repurchase agreement, which is a secured borrowing with a pool of securities pledged against the balance.
The Company also utilizes long-term debt, consisting principally of FHLB fixed and amortizing advances to fund its balance sheet with original maturities greater than one year. The Company evaluates its funding needs, interest rate movements, the cost of options, and the availability of attractive structures when considering the timing and extent of when it enters into long-term borrowings.
In December 2018, the Company issued unsecured subordinated notes payable totaling $32.5 million, the proceeds of which were designated for general corporate use, including funding of cash consideration for mergers and acquisitions.
For additional information about borrowings, refer to Note 13, Short-Term Borrowings, Note 14, Long-Term Debt, and Note 15, Subordinated Notes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Shareholders' Equity
In 2021, total shareholders’ equity increased by $25.5 million, or 10%. Net income increased equity by $32.9 million. AOCI increased by $1.1 million due to a reclassification adjustment to the consolidated statement of income from the termination of an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge of $972 thousand and tax-effected unrealized gains on available for sale of $131 thousand. Dividends paid to shareholders decreased equity by $8.3 million.
In September 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which is more fully described in Item 5 under Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Subsequently on April 19, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the additional future repurchase of up to 562,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan is 743,830 shares at December 31, 2021.
The following table includes additional information for shareholders’ equity for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Capital Adequacy and Regulatory Matters
Capital management in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to its shareholders while maintaining sufficient levels of capital and related risk-based regulatory capital ratios to satisfy statutory regulatory requirements. The Company’s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to its shareholders, while maintaining a “well capitalized” position of regulatory strength.
Effective with the third quarter of 2018, the FRB raised the consolidated asset limit on small bank holding companies from $1 billion to $3 billion, and a company with assets under the revised limits is not subject to the FRB consolidated capital rules. A company with consolidated assets under the revised limit may continue to file reports that include capital amounts and ratios. The Parent Company has elected to continue to file those reports.
Management believes the Parent Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject at December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was considered well capitalized under applicable banking regulations.
Tables presenting the Parent Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included in Note 17 Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital, to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
The Company routinely evaluates its capital levels in light of its risk profile to assess its capital needs. In addition to the minimum capital ratio requirement and minimum capital ratio to be well capitalized presented in the tables in Note 17, we must maintain a capital conservation buffer as noted in Item 1 - Business under the topic Basel III Capital Rules. At December 31, 2021, the Parent Company's and the Bank's capital conservation buffer, based on the most restrictive capital ratio, was 6.2% and 6.0%, respectively, which are above the regulatory requirement of 2.50% at December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Rate Sensitivity
Liquidity. The primary function of asset/liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity and manage the Company’s sensitivity to changing interest rates. Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. The Company's primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities, the sale of mortgage loans and borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company's maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB is $873.1 million at December 31, 2021.
The Company regularly adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities and the objectives of its asset/liability management policy.
At December 31, 2021, outstanding loan commitments totaled $825.1 million, which included $164.8 million in undisbursed loans, $261.6 million in unused home equity lines of credit, $379.0 million in commercial lines of credit, and $19.7 million in performance standby letters of credit. Time deposits due within one year after December 31, 2021 totaled $237.8 million, or 79% of time deposits. The large percentage of time deposits that mature within one year reflects clients’ preference not to invest funds for long periods in the current interest rate environment. If these maturing deposits do not remain with the Company, it may be required to seek other sources of funds, including other time deposits and lines of credit. Depending on market conditions, the Company may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than it currently pays on time deposits outstanding at December 31, 2021. The Company has the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates it offers.
The Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets depend on the Company's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $208.7 million, compared with $125.3 million at December 31, 2020. Available for sale securities, net of pledging requirements, provide additional sources of liquidity, and totaled $176.9 million at December 31, 2021. Also at December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to borrow up to a total of $873.1 million from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, of which $59.0 million in advances and letters of credit were outstanding. The Company’s ability to borrow from the FHLB is dependent on having sufficient qualifying collateral, which generally consists of mortgage loans. In addition, the Company had $30.0 million in available unsecured lines of credit with other banks at December 31, 2021.
The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders and interest on its borrowings. The Company also has repurchased shares of its common stock. The Company’s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. Restrictions on the Bank’s ability to dividend funds to the Company are described in Note 17, Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Interest Rate Sensitivity. Interest rate sensitivity management requires the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Management, through its asset/liability management process, attempts to manage the level of repricing and maturity mismatch so that fluctuations in net interest income are maintained within policy limits in current and expected market conditions. For further discussion, see Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Contractual Obligations
The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business to fund loan growth, for asset/liability management purposes, to meet required capital needs and for other corporate purposes. The following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations of principal by payment date at December 31, 2021. Further discussion of the
nature of each obligation is d in the referenced Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" referenced in the following table.
The contractual obligations table above does not include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit that are detailed in the following section. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, therefore the total commitment does not necessarily represent future cash requirements and is excluded from the contractual obligations table.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.
The following table details significant commitments at December 31, 2021.
A discussion of the nature, business purpose, and guarantees that result from the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 19, Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Measures
As a result of prior acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $22.9 million and $24.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Management believes providing certain “non-GAAP” information will assist investors in their understanding of the effect of acquisition activity on reported results, particularly to overcome comparability issues related to the influence of intangibles (principally goodwill) created in acquisitions.
Tangible book value per share and the allowance to non-SBA guaranteed loans, as used by the Company in this supplemental reporting presentation, are determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. While the Company's management believes this information is a useful supplement to the GAAP based measures reported in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, readers are cautioned that this non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with
GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results and financial condition as reported under GAAP, nor are such measures necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to be determined in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents the computation of each non-GAAP based measure shown together with its most directly comparable GAAP based measure.
