ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Executive Summary
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Since then, some federal, state, and local executive orders have been lifted and we continue to follow practical safety procedures. These procedures include, but are not limited to wearing masks, social distancing, staggering start times, and teleconferencing versus in person meetings. Almost all of our employees have been fully vaccinated. We recently resumed in person meetings with some customers and continue to maintain regular contact, via phone and other electronic means, with other customers and suppliers whom we are still unable to visit in person.
Based on ongoing conversations with customers, we do not expect to experience any material impairments or changes in accounting judgements related to COVID-19. Although we continue to face a period of uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and emergence of new variants on projected customer demand, market conditions continue to gradually improve. In the midst of this challenging environment, we remain focused on taking the necessary steps to respond quickly to changes in our business through specific contingency plans including (but not limited to): reviewing and monitoring planned capital expenditures, reviewing all operating expenses for opportunities to reduce and/or defer spending, and aligning inventory to planned shipments and estimated revenue.
We continue to monitor the evolving situation related to COVID-19 including guidance from federal, state, and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on these recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 or the emergence of new variants on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity in the future.
Two additional issues continue to affect national and global market conditions. First, supply chain disruptions have become more frequent in recent months for the Company and some of its customers. Thus far, we have not experienced material adverse effects regarding product shipments; however, timely sourcing of certain materials is of increased concern. Second, published articles and corporate announcements continue to address the global semiconductor chip shortage, which is anticipated to continue in 2022. This shortage is affecting some of our customers which could impact the Company’s revenue, volume, and profitability. We continue to actively monitor these developments, including ongoing contact with our suppliers and customers, and adapting to their specific circumstances and forecasts.
On April 17, 2020, we entered into an unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), with a principal amount of $325,300. The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The SBA approved our Forgiveness Application in full on January 6, 2021.
The Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”), as originally enacted on March 27, 2020, by the CARES Act, is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes equal to 50% of the qualified wages an eligible employer pays to employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act (the “Relief Act”), enacted on December 27, 2020, amended, and extended the ERC. On March 1, 2021, the IRS released Notice 2021-20 to provide guidance on the original ERC, as modified by the Relief Act. During 2021 we filed Form 941-X to claim a credit of $105,000 on qualified wages paid in 2020. This receivable appears on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, as Tax Receivable, and as a credit to wages in the Statement of Operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
The Relief Act extended and enhanced the ERC for qualified wages paid after December 31, 2020, through June 30, 2021. Under the Relief Act, eligible employers may claim a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes equal to 70% of the qualified wages an eligible employer pays to employees after December 31, 2020, through June 30, 2021. As of the March 11, 2021, passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, the ERC was available for all four quarters of 2021. However, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act enacted on November 15, 2021, ended the ERC effective September 30, 2021.
During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a decline in gross receipts of 25% compared to the first quarter of 2019. This decline, along with continued underutilization of certain manufacturing equipment, reduction in employee’s workloads, travel restrictions and supply chain issues, qualified us to receive the ERC. We filed Form 941 for the first quarter of 2021 and claimed a credit of $150,507 on qualified wages paid in the first quarter of 2021. These funds were received during the second quarter of 2021 and appear as a credit to wages in the Statement of Operations during 2021. An employer that has a decline continues to be eligible until the end of the calendar quarter in which gross receipts are greater than 80% of its 2019 calendar quarter receipts. Thus, we were eligible for this credit for the second quarter of 2021 in the amount of $151,701, which appears as a credit to wages in the Statement of Operations for 2021.
During the second quarter of 2021, we experienced a decline in gross receipts of 30% compared to the second quarter of 2019. This decline, along with continued underutilization of certain manufacturing equipment, reduction in employee’s workloads, travel restrictions and supply chain issues, qualified us to receive the ERC for the third quarter of 2021. As previously mentioned, an employer that has a decline in gross receipts continues to be eligible until the end of the calendar quarter in which gross receipts are greater than 80% of its 2019 calendar quarter receipts. As a result, we were eligible for this credit for the third quarter of 2021 in the amount of $153,713, which appears as a credit to wages in the Statement of Operations for 2021.
In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allows eligible employers with fewer than 500 employees to qualify for a tax credit for providing paid time off for each employee receiving COVID-19 vaccinations and for any time needed to recover from the vaccine. The Company received a credit of $11,042 and this amount appears as a credit to wages in the Statement of Operations for 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total revenue of $13,448,021. This was an increase of $2,551,992, or 23.4%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased volume and higher raw material pricing. During 2020, total revenue was adversely impacted by lower volume, pricing, and COVID-19 related issues.
Gross profit was $3,529,255 for 2021 compared to $2,198,290 for 2020. The increase was attributable to higher revenue as well as product mix and improved manufacturing efficiency.
Operating expenses were $1,751,349 and $1,681,943 for 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Income from operations was $1,777,906 and $516,347 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, which included $571,962 related to the ERC and ARP credits during 2021.
Consistent with our growth strategy, we have identified niche markets that can benefit from our expertise in custom powder solutions, such as near-infrared doped phosphors and short-wave infrared applications. These applications enable extended life of phosphors for specific nighttime identification needs of defense personnel and first responders.
New initiatives are also being pursued that utilize our vacuum hot press, cold isostatic press, and kilns for increased production and development projects, including diffusion bonding. We recently manufactured and sold conductive metal oxides for direct current sputtering of Tungsten Oxide and Molybdenum Oxide materials. We continue to invest in developing new products for all our markets including specialty bonding processes for Aerospace customers. Those products involve research and development expense to accelerate time to market.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year 2021 compared to Year 2020
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total revenue of $13,448,021. This was an increase of $2,551,992, or 23.4%, compared to 2020. The increase was principally due to increased volume and higher raw material pricing in 2021. During 2020, total revenue was adversely impacted by lower volume, pricing, and COVID-19 related issues.
Gross profit
Gross profit was $3,529,255 for 2021 compared to $2,198,290 for 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin) was 26.2% and 20.2% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was attributable to higher revenue as well as product mix and improved manufacturing efficiency. In addition, $328,356 was related to the ERC and ARP credits recognized in 2021.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense for 2021 and 2020, was $1,280,579 and $1,148,615, respectively, an increase of 11.5%. Increases in compensation and professional fees were partially offset by the ERC and ARP credits of $79,354 during 2021.
Included in general and administrative expense was $270,609 and $222,024 for professional fees during 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenses were primarily related to SEC compliance costs for legal, accounting and stockholder relations fees. Additional fees were incurred during 2021 for the redemption of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B.
Research and development expense
Research and development expense for 2021 was $235,679 compared to $337,823 for 2020, a decrease of 30.2%. This decrease was primarily related to ERC and ARP credits of $90,974 during 2021. Specialty materials continue to be researched for use in niche markets which include custom applications and additive manufacturing. Our development efforts utilize a disciplined innovation approach focused on accelerating time to market for these applications and involve ongoing research and development expense.
Marketing and sales expense
Marketing and sales expense was $235,091 and $195,505 during 2021 and 2020, respectively. This was an increase of $39,586, or 20.2%. This increase was primarily related to higher compensation expense related to an increase in staff, outside consulting expense and increased travel with resumption of limited in-person meetings and industry tradeshows. These increased expenses were partially offset by the ERC and ARP credits of $73,278.
Stock compensation expense
Included in total expenses were non-cash stock-based compensation costs of $47,903 and $124,720 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards is based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the required service (vesting) period. Unrecognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $6,305 as of December 31, 2021, and will be recognized through 2023.
Interest
Interest expense was $32,140 and $32,087 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lower lease interest expense attributable to principal payments for lease obligations for 2021 was offset by less interest income due to lower interest rates during 2021 compared to the prior year.
Income taxes
Income tax expense was $392,242 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. In December 2020, we reversed in full our valuation allowance that had been recorded against the unrealizability of the deferred tax asset, which resulted in the recording of the asset of $1,019,317 at December 31, 2020. An income tax benefit of $1,017,503 for the year ended December 31, 2020, was recorded on the Statement of Operations. Management considered new evidence, both positive and negative, during 2021 that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets and determined that no valuation allowance was necessary, and the deferred tax asset was $663,820 at December 31, 2021.
Income applicable to common stock
Income applicable to common stock for 2021 and 2020 was $1,654,672 and $1,477,611, respectively. The income in 2021 was primarily the result of higher revenue, improved gross profit, and the ERC, as well as forgiveness of the PPP Loan in January 2021. The income tax benefit of $1,017,503 noted above represented a significant portion of income applicable to common stock for 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash
As of December 31, 2021, cash on hand was $4,140,942 compared to $2,917,551 at December 31, 2020. This increase of 44% was attributable to higher gross profit throughout 2021 as well as the ERC.
Working capital
At December 31, 2021, working capital was $3,907,135 compared to $2,810,629 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,096,506 or 39.0%. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cash noted above.
Cash from operations
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2021 was $2,610,548 and $991,032 during 2020. These figures represent net income net of noncash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $516,579 and $532,842 and non-cash stock-based compensation costs of $47,902 and $124,720 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, due to orders received throughout 2021, accrued expenses and customer deposits increased $834,718, and prepaid expenses increased $547,023 during 2021. Customer deposits decreased $1,378,531 and inventory decreased $1,566,457 during 2020. Deferred tax asset decreased $360,410 in 2021 from the initial amount of $1,017,503 recognized at December 31, 2020.
Cash from investing activities
Cash of $706,242 and $78,915 was used in investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for the acquisition of production equipment. The Company used cash for the acquisition of production equipment during 2021 rather than utilize an equipment lease line of credit that was available.
Cash from financing activities
Cash of $160,416 and $127,174 was used in financing activities for principal payments to third parties for finance lease obligations during 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was due to the commencement of a finance lease during the second half of 2020 for the rebuild of production equipment. On December 31, 2021, we redeemed all 24,152 shares of our Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B. The redemption included cash payments of $248,766 plus unpaid annual dividends of $265,672. A dividend payment of $24,152 was previously made to owners of this stock during the second quarter of 2021 and 2020. As previously mentioned, during 2020 we entered into an unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program, with a principal amount of $325,300 which was forgiven in January 2021.
Debt outstanding
Total debt outstanding decreased to $243,218 at December 31, 2021, from $728,934 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of 67%. As previously mentioned, cash of $160,416 was used for principal payments for finance lease obligations and our PPP loan of $325,300 was forgiven in full by the SBA.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory allowances, property and equipment depreciable lives, patents and license useful lives, revenue recognition, income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and assessing changes in which impairment of certain long-lived assets may occur. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected. Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected. The tax valuation allowance is based on our consideration of new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect our view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. If we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would reduce our net income for that period. Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property and equipment, licenses and patents are based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets and intangibles will provide benefit. Changes in circumstances related to a change in our business, change in technology or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets.
Inflation
While there was not a significant impact from inflation on our operations during the past three fiscal years, we experienced increased costs during 2021 that are expected to continue into 2022.
