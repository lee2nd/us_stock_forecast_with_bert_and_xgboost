Net cash used by operating activities was $27,483 during the 2021 fiscal year resulting from the net loss of $107,183, which was offset by the amortization of debt discount of $2,718, depreciation in the amount of $226, a $25,658 increase in accounts payable and a $45,098 increase in accrued interest. Net cash used by operating activities was $68,694 during the 2020 fiscal year resulting from the net loss of $119,191, which was offset by the amortization of debt discount of $7,198, depreciation in the amount of $286, a $16,160 increase in accounts payable and a $26,853 increase in accrued interest.
There were no cash flows from investing activities during the 2021 and 2020 fiscal years.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $27,550 during the 2021 fiscal year which consisted of proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable - related parties.

The Company cannot presently foresee the cash requirements of any business opportunity which may ultimately be acquired by the Company.
