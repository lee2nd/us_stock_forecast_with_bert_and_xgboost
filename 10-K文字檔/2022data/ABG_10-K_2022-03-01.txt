Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements"] and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
OVERVIEW
We are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, through our Dealerships segment, we owned and operated 205 new vehicle franchises (155 dealership locations), representing 31 brands of automobiles, 35 collision centers, seven stand-alone used vehicle dealerships, one used vehicle wholesale business and one auto auction, within 15 states. Our stores offer an extensive range of automotive products and services, including new and used vehicles; parts and service, which include repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair service; and finance and insurance products. The finance and insurance products are provided by independent third parties and our recently acquired F&I product provider, TCA. The F&I products offered by TCA are primarily sold through LHM Dealerships. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our new vehicle revenue brand mix consisted of 39% imports, 44% luxury, and 17% domestic brands. As a result of the LHM Acquisition on December 17, 2021, as outlined below, the Company now reflects its operations in two reportable segments: Dealerships and TCA.
Our Dealerships segment revenues are derived primarily from: (i) the sale of new vehicles; (ii) the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers ("used retail") and to other dealers at auction ("wholesale") (the terms "used retail" and "wholesale" collectively referred to as "used"); (iii) repair and maintenance services, including collision repair, the sale of automotive replacement parts, and the reconditioning of used vehicles (collectively referred to as "parts and service"); and (iv) the arrangement of third-party vehicle financing and the sale of a number of vehicle protection products. F&I products are offered by dealerships to customers in connection with the purchase of vehicles through either TCA or independent third parties. F&I revenue recorded by the Dealerships segment related to TCA products is eliminated upon consolidation. We evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold, our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit, and our F&I business based on F&I gross profit per vehicle sold.
Our dealerships gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Historically, the sales of new vehicles generally results in a lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales, sales of parts and service, and sales of F&I products. As a result, when used vehicle, parts and service, and F&I revenue increase as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase.
Our TCA segment revenues, reflected in F&I Revenues, are derived from the sale of various vehicle protection products including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection insurance, prepaid maintenance contracts, vehicle theft assistance contracts and appearance protection contracts. These products are sold primarily through LHM Dealerships. TCA's F&I Revenues are supplemented with investment gains or losses and income earned associated with the performance of TCA's investment portfolio.
Our TCA segment gross profit margin can vary due to incurred claims expense and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs expensed over the life of a customer contract. Certain F&I products may result in higher TCA gross profit margins. Therefore, the product mix of F&I products sold by TCA can affect the gross profits earned. In addition, interest rate volatility based on economic and market conditions outside the control of the Company, may increase or reduce TCA segment gross profit margins as well as the fair market values of certain securities within our investment portfolio. Fair market values typically fluctuate inversely to the fluctuations in interest rates.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A significant portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions) or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long-term. We evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit, advertising expense on a per vehicle retailed ("PVR") basis, and all other SG&A expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit. Commissions expense paid by TCA to our affiliated dealerships and reflected as F&I Revenue in our Dealerships segment is eliminated upon consolidation.
Our continued organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy, the continued strength of our brand mix, and the production and allocation of desirable vehicles from the automobile manufacturers whose brands we sell. Our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with product availability as well as local and national economic conditions, including consumer confidence, availability of consumer credit, fuel prices, and employment levels.
In addition, our ability to sell certain new and used vehicles can be negatively impacted by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Manufacturers continue to be hampered by the lack of availability of parts and key components from suppliers such as semi-conductor chips, which has disrupted production and impacted new vehicle inventory levels. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, certain vehicle manufacturers have needed to slow or temporarily halt assembly lines for the safety of their workers. We cannot predict with any certainty how long the automotive retail industry will continue to be subject to these production slowdowns or when normalized production will resume at these manufacturers. We continue to monitor and respond as necessary to the Company’s operational needs during the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the resulting economic uncertainty.
Larry H. Miller Acquisition
On September 28, 2021, Asbury Automotive Group, LLC (“Purchaser”), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into (i) a Purchase Agreement (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”) with certain members of the Larry H. Miller Dealership family of entities; (ii) a Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Real Estate Purchase Agreement”) with Miller Family Real Estate, L.L.C. and (iii) a Purchase Agreement (the “TCA Purchase Agreement” and together with the Equity Purchase Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, the “Transaction Agreements”) with certain equity owners of the Total Care Auto, Powered by Landcar (“TCA”) business affiliated with the Larry H. Miller Dealership family of entities. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreements, we agreed to acquire the equity interests of, and the real property related to (collectively, the “Transactions”), the businesses of the Larry H. Miller Dealerships ("LHM") and TCA (collectively, the “Businesses”), each described in the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement and the TCA Purchase Agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.48 billion, comprising approximately $2.51 billion of goodwill and franchise rights intangible assets, $792.6 million of property and equipment, and $285.0 million in inventories less $105.6 million of liabilities assumed, net of other assets acquired.
On December 17, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the Businesses, thereby acquiring 54 new vehicle dealerships, seven used cars dealerships, 11 collision centers, a used vehicle wholesale business, the real property related thereto, and the entities comprising the TCA business for a total purchase price of $3.48 billion. The real property was acquired in escrow, to be released, together with the related portion of the purchase price, subject to the satisfaction of certain title related conditions. The purchase price was financed through a combination of cash, proceeds from the issuance of common stock and borrowings including the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes and 2032 Senior Notes, the drawdown on the 2021 Real Estate Facility and the 2019 Senior Credit Facility and other floor plan borrowings.
Park Place Acquisition
On December 11, 2019, the Company entered into (1) an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "2019 Asset Purchase Agreement") with certain members of the Park Place Dealership family of entities, Park Place Mid-Cities, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, and the identified principal (collectively, "Park Place") and (2) a Real Estate Purchase Agreement (the "Real Estate Purchase Agreement" and, together with the 2019 Asset Purchase Agreement, the "2019 Park Place Agreements") with certain members of the Park Place Dealership family of entities to acquire substantially all of the assets of, and certain real property related to, the Park Place business. The 2019 Asset Purchase Agreement included the purchase of 19 franchises (3 Mercedes-Benz, 3 Sprinter, 2 Lexus, 2 Jaguar, 2 Land Rover, 1 Porsche, and 1 Volvo and 5 ultra luxury brands including 1 Bentley, 1 Rolls Royce, 1 McLaren, 1 Maserati and 1 Karma), two collision centers and an auto auction. On March 24, 2020, Asbury delivered notice to the sellers terminating the 2019 Park Place Agreements pursuant to the terms thereof in exchange for the payment of $10.0 million of liquidated damages. Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details regarding the impact on financing transactions.
As a result of the Company's efforts to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, along with a strong May and June 2020 performance, the Company reengaged on the Park Place Dealership group acquisition under more favorable pricing and more flexible financing terms, including limiting the purchase of luxury dealership franchises to those most aligned with the Company's core strategic business. On July 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Revised Asset Purchase Agreement") with Park Place to acquire substantially all of the assets of, and lease the real property related to, 12 new vehicle dealership franchises (3 Mercedes-Benz, 3 Sprinter, 2 Lexus, 1 Jaguar, 1 Land Rover, 1 Porsche, and 1 Volvo), two collision centers and an auto auction comprising the Park Place Dealership group (collectively, the "Park Place acquisition") for a purchase price of $889.9 million. The Park Place acquisition was completed on August 24, 2020. The purchase price was financed through a combination of cash, floor plan facilities and seller financing. In September 2020, the
Company redeemed the amounts outstanding related to the seller financing. Certain of the leased real property was subsequently acquired in May 2021 for $217.1 million.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions, that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements, in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.
Goodwill and Manufacturer Franchise Rights-
Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair market value of its identifiable assets and liabilities. We have determined, based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business, how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another, and how we review the results of our operations, that we have several geographic market-based operating segments. We have determined the dealerships in each of our operating segments are components that are aggregated into several geographic market-based reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, as they (i) have similar economic characteristics, (ii) offer similar products and services (all of our franchised dealerships offer new and used vehicles, parts and service, and arrange for third-party vehicle financing and the sale of insurance products), (iii) have similar customers, (iv) have similar distribution and marketing practices (all of our dealerships distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar ways) and (v) operate under similar regulatory environments.
Our only other significant identifiable intangible assets are our rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers, which are recorded at an individual franchise level. The fair value of our manufacturer franchise rights are determined at the acquisition date, by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise. We have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives, and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers' brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing our manufacturer franchise rights would expire, we expect that we would be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed quantitative impairment tests as of March 31, 2020, and identified eleven dealerships with franchise rights carrying values that exceeded their fair values, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $23.0 million. No franchise right impairments were identified in 2021.
We do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually as of October 1st, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that any impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our automotive retail business or manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our individual franchises.
F&I Chargeback Reserves-
We receive commissions from third-party lending and insurance institutions for arranging customer financing and from the sale of vehicle service contracts, GAP insurance, and other vehicle protection products. F&I commissions are recorded at the time the associated vehicle is sold.
We may be charged back for F&I commissions in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated ("chargebacks"). F&I commissions, net of estimated future chargebacks, are included in Revenues - Finance and Insurance, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. We reserve for chargebacks on finance and vehicle service and other protection product contract commissions received. The reserve is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts and is evaluated on a product-by-product basis.
Our F&I cash chargebacks for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $45.5 million, $38.0 million, and $40.6 million, respectively. Our chargeback reserves were $50.4 million and $47.3 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total chargebacks as a percentage of F&I commissions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were 11%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. A 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate for future chargebacks, would
change our finance and insurance chargeback reserve by approximately $4.2 million as of December 31, 2021. Chargeback reserves estimated for products underwritten by TCA are eliminated in consolidation.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Total revenue during 2021 increased by $2.71 billion (38%) compared to 2020, due to a $1.17 billion (31%) increase in new vehicle revenue, a $1.15 billion (53%) increase in used vehicle revenue, a $293.1 million (33%) increase in parts and service revenue and a $100.0 million (33%) increase in F&I revenue. The $678.8 million (55%) increase in gross profit during 2021 was the result of a $272.0 million (124%) increase in new vehicle gross profit, a $131.7 million (84%) increase in used vehicle gross profit, a $178.7 million (33%) increase in parts and service gross profit and a $96.4 million (32%) increase in F&I gross profit. Our total gross profit margin increased 210 basis points from 17.2% in 2020 to 19.3% in 2021.
Income from operations during 2021 increased by $421.0 million (114%) compared to 2020, primarily due to a $678.8 million (55%) increase in gross profit, a $23.0 million decrease in franchise rights impairment, a $14.6 million decrease in other operating expenses, net, partially offset by a $292.0 million (37%) increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and a $3.4 million (9%) increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.
Total other expenses, net increased by $61.4 million (188%) in 2021, primarily due to a $54.3 million decrease in gain on dealership divestitures, a $37.2 million increase in other interest expense, net, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in floor plan interest expense and a $20.6 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt. As a result, income before income taxes increased by $359.6 million (106%) to $697.7 million in 2021. The $81.6 million (97%) increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the 106% increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a 110 basis point decrease in the 2021 effective tax rate. Overall, net income increased by $278.0 million (109%) from $254.4 million in 2020 to $532.4 million in 2021.
We assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.
DEALERSHIP SEGMENT
New Vehicle-
New Vehicle Metrics-
New vehicle revenue increased by $1.17 billion (31%), as a result of a 15% increase in new vehicle unit sales and a 13% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue increased by $496.3 million (13%) as a result of a 4% increase in new vehicle units sold and a 9% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold.
Same store new vehicle gross profit in 2021 increased by $190.6 million (89%), as a result of a 82% increase in gross profit per new vehicle sold and a 4% increase in unit volumes. Same store new vehicle gross margin increased 390 basis points to 9.7% in 2021, primarily as a result of a supply shortage for much of 2021 caused by manufacturer production challenges caused by the semi-conductor shortage and the COVID-19 pandemic. We finished 2021 with a eight day supply of new vehicle inventory which is below our targeted days supply primarily as a result of these manufacturer production challenges.
Used Vehicle-
Used Vehicle Metrics-
Used vehicle revenue increased by $1.15 billion (53%), due to a $1.13 billion (58%) increase in used retail revenue and a $20.2 million (8%) increase in used vehicle wholesale revenue. Same store used vehicle revenue increased by $689.7 million (33%) due to an $749.8 million (40%) increase in used vehicle retail revenue, partially offset by a $60.1 million (26%) decrease in used vehicle wholesale revenues.
In 2021, total Company and same store used vehicle retail gross profit margins both increased 110 and 100 basis points, respectively, to 8.6%. We primarily attribute the increases in used vehicle retail gross profit margin to increased demand for used vehicles as a result of new vehicle inventory shortages caused by semiconductor supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions.
We believe that our used vehicle inventory continues to be well-aligned with current consumer demand, with approximately 34 days of supply as of December 31, 2021.
Parts and Service-
* Reconditioning and preparation represents the gross profit earned by our parts and service departments for internal work performed and is included as a reduction of Parts and service cost of sales within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income upon the sale of the vehicle.
The $294.5 million (33%) increase in parts and service revenue was due to a $218.7 million (37%) increase in customer pay revenue, a $65.8 million (54%) increase in wholesale parts revenue, and a $10.0 million (6%) increase in warranty revenue. Same store parts and service revenue increased $126.7 million (15%) from $867.8 million in 2020 to $994.5 million in 2021. The increase in same store parts and service revenue was due to a $103.7 million (18%) increase in customer pay revenue and a $41.7 million (35%) increase in wholesale parts revenue, partially offset by a $18.7 million (11%) decrease in warranty revenue.
Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $141.1 million (33%) to $566.6 million and same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $55.1 million (13%) to $470.1 million. The $55.1 million increase in same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, is primarily due to a $59.8 million (20%) increase in customer pay gross profit, and a $7.1 million (33%) increase in wholesale parts gross profit, partially offset by an $11.8 million (13%) decrease in warranty gross profit. The parts and service business was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but has since recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the shortage of new vehicle inventory has increased demand for used vehicles which in turn has generated addition reconditioning and preparation gross profit for the parts and service departments.
Finance and Insurance, net-
F&I revenue, net increased by $97.6 million (32%) in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily as a result of a 22% increase in new and used retail unit sales and an 8% increase in F&I per vehicle retailed.
On a same store basis F&I revenue, net increased by $64.9 million (22%) in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily as a result of an 11% increase in new and used retail unit sales and a 9% increase in F&I per vehicle retailed.
During 2021 we continued to benefit from a favorable consumer lending environment, which allowed more of our customers to take advantage of a broader array of F&I products and our continued focus on improving the F&I results at our lower-performing stores through our F&I training programs.
TCA SEGMENT
On December 17, 2021 we acquired TCA. TCA offers a variety of F&I products, such as extended vehicle service contracts, prepaid maintenance contracts, GAP insurance, vehicle theft assistance contracts, key replacement contracts, paintless dent repair contracts, appearance protection contracts, tire and wheel, and lease wear-and-tear contracts. The majority of TCA's products are sold through affiliated LHM automobile dealerships.
Revenue generated by TCA is earned over the period of the related service product contract. The method for recognizing revenue is assigned based on contract type and expected claim patterns. Premium revenues are supplemented with investment gains or losses and income earned associated with the performance of TCA's investment portfolio. During the 15-day period the Company owned TCA in December 2021, TCA generated $12.0 million of revenue, consisting of both earned premium and investment income.
Direct expenses paid for the acquisition of contracts on which revenue has been received but not yet earned have been deferred and are amortized over the related contract period. Expenses are matched with earned premiums resulting in recognition over the life of the contracts. During the 15-day period the Company owned TCA in December 2021, TCA recorded $6.5 million of cost of sales consisting primarily of claims expense and amortization of deferred acquisition costs.
CONSOLIDATED
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense-
SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased 740 basis points from 63.9% in 2020 to 56.5% in 2021. Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased 630 basis points from 63.8% in 2020 to 57.5% in 2021. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of gross profit is primarily the result of higher gross profits earned across our Dealership segment, as well as maintaining expense discipline, particularly in personnel costs, with enhanced productivity of our team members.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense -
The $3.4 million (9%) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily the result of depreciation associated with dealership acquisitions during 2021, additional assets placed into service during 2021, and depreciation expense associated with the purchase of previously leased properties.
Franchise Rights Impairment -
We assessed our manufacturer franchise rights for impairment by comparing the present value of cash flows attributable to each franchise right to its carrying value. As a result of our impairment testing performed, we recognized no impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021 and a $23.0 million pre-tax non-cash charge related to eleven dealerships during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Operating (Income) Expenses, net -
Other operating (income) expenses, net includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded other operating income, net of $5.4 million, which included a $3.5 million gain related to legal settlements and a $1.9 million gain on divestitures of certain real estate.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded other operating expense, net of $9.2 million, which included $12.9 million related to the Park Place acquisition, $0.7 million real estate related impairment partially offset by a $2.1 million gain related to legal settlements and a $0.3 million gain related to the sale of vacant real estate.
Floor Plan Interest Expense -
Floor plan interest expense decreased by $9.5 million (54%) to $8.2 million during 2021 compared to $17.7 million during 2020, as a result of lower new vehicle inventory levels during 2021 caused by production issues related to the semiconductor shortage and COVID-19.
Other Interest Expense -
Other interest expense increased $37.2 million (66%) from $56.7 million in 2020 to $93.9 million in 2021. In 2021, we incurred approximately $27.5 million in bridge commitment fees related to our acquisition of LHM and TCA. During 2021, we also incurred additional interest expense related to our $800.0 million 2029 Notes (as defined below) and $600.0 million 2032 Notes (as defined below) issued in November 2021, the proceeds of which were also used to finance recent acquisitions. In addition, we incurred interest expense in connection with the 2021 BofA Real Estate Facility, the proceeds of which was used to finance the acquisition of previously leased Park Place Dealership premises.
Gain on Dealership Divestitures -
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold one franchise (one dealership location) in the Charlottesville, Virginia market. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain totaling $8.0 million, which is presented in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as Gain on dealership divestitures, net.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold two franchises (two dealership locations) in the Atlanta, Georgia market, we sold six franchises (five dealership locations) and one collision center in the Jackson, Mississippi market, and we sold one franchise (one dealership location) in the Greenville, South Carolina market. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain totaling $62.3 million.
Income Tax Expense -
The $81.6 million (97%) increase in income tax expense was the result of a $359.6 million (106%) increase in income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased 110 basis points from 24.8% in 2020 to 23.7% in 2021. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to decreases in state rates in jurisdictions in which the Company has significant activity. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 25%-26% in 2022 as we expand our operations into states with higher tax rates.
Refer to Note 16 "Income Taxes" for additional information regarding income taxes.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
______________________________
NM-Not Meaningful
Total revenue during 2020 decreased by $78.5 million (1%) compared to 2019, due to a $95.9 million (2%) decrease in new vehicle revenue, a $9.6 million (1%) decrease in parts and service revenue and a $10.9 million (3%) decrease in F&I revenue, partially offset by a $37.9 million (2%) increase in used vehicle revenue. The $54.5 million (5%) increase in gross profit during 2020 was the result of a $59.0 million (37%) increase in new vehicle gross profit, a $22.5 million (17%) increase in used vehicle gross profit, partially offset by a $16.1 million (3%) decrease in parts and service gross profit and a $10.9 million (3%) decrease in F&I gross profit. Our total gross profit margin increased 100 basis points from 16.2% in 2019 to 17.2% in 2020.
Income from operations during 2020 increased by $45.8 million (14%) compared to 2019, primarily due to a $54.5 million (5%) increase in gross profit and a $17.9 million (2%) decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses partially offset by a $15.9 million increase in franchise rights impairment, an $8.4 million increase in other operating expenses, net and a $2.3 million (6%) increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.
Total other expenses, net decreased by $48.4 million (60%) in 2020, primarily due to a $50.6 million increase in gain on dealership divestitures and a $20.2 million decrease in floor plan interest expense, partially offset by a $20.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt and a $1.8 million increase in other interest expense, net. As a result, income before income taxes increased by $94.2 million (39%) to $338.1 million in 2020. The $24.2 million (41%) increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the 39% increase in income before taxes and a 40 basis point increase in the 2020 effective tax rate. Overall, net income increased by $70.0 million (38%) from $184.4 million in 2019 to $254.4 million in 2020.
We assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.
New Vehicle-
New Vehicle Metrics-
New vehicle revenue decreased by $95.9 million (2%), as a result of a 10% decrease in new vehicle unit sales partially offset by an 8% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue decreased by $317.1 million (9%) as a result of a 12% decrease in new vehicle units sold, partially offset by a 4% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold.
Same store new vehicle gross profit in 2020 increased by $27.9 million (19%), as a result of a 36% increase in gross profit per new vehicle sold partially offset by a 12% decrease in unit volumes. Same store new vehicle gross margin increased 120 basis point to 5.4% in 2020, primarily as a result of a supply shortage for much of 2020 caused by manufactures reducing or halting production due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We finished 2020 with a 40 day supply of new vehicle inventory which is below our target of 70 to 75 days primarily as a result of production challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Used Vehicle-
______________________________
NM-Not Meaningful
Used Vehicle Metrics-
Used vehicle revenue increased by $37.9 million (2%), due to a $49.2 million (26%) increase in used vehicle wholesale revenue partially offset by a $11.3 million (1%) decrease in used retail revenue. Same store used vehicle revenue decreased by $71.4 million (4%) due to an $86.6 million (5%) decrease in used vehicle retail revenue, partially offset by a $15.2 million (9%) increase in used vehicle wholesale revenues.
In 2020, total Company and same store used vehicle retail gross profit margins increased 60 basis points to 7.5% and 7.6%, respectively. We primarily attribute the increase in used vehicle retail gross profit margin to increased demand for used vehicles as a result of new vehicle inventory shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
We believe that our used vehicle inventory continues to be well-aligned with current consumer demand, with approximately 31 days of supply as of December 31, 2020.
Parts and Service-
* Reconditioning and preparation represents the gross profit earned by our parts and service departments for internal work performed and is included as a reduction of Parts and service cost of sales within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income upon the sale of the vehicle.
The $9.6 million (1%) decrease in parts and service revenue was primarily due to a $11.2 million decrease in wholesale parts revenue and a $0.3 million decrease in customer pay revenue partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in warranty revenue. The wholesale parts business was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which significantly reduced demand as a result of fewer miles being driven. Same store parts and service revenue decreased $64.6 million (8%) from $840.0 million in 2019 to $775.4 million in 2020. The decrease in same store parts and service revenue was due to a $33.9 million (7%) decrease in customer pay revenue, a $13.6 million (9%) decrease in warranty revenue, and a $11.1 million (9%) decrease in wholesale parts revenue.
Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, decreased by $4.4 million (1%) to $425.5 million and same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, decreased by $38.0 million (9%) to $365.9 million. The $38.0 million decrease in same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, is primarily due to a $29.2 million (10%) decrease in customer pay gross profit, a $6.7 million (8%) decrease in warranty gross profit, and a $2.1 million (10%) decrease in wholesale parts gross profit. The COVID-19 global pandemic negatively impacted our parts and service business for most of 2020 as a result of people driving fewer miles and therefore requiring less vehicle maintenance. In addition, fewer accidents on the roadways negatively impacted our collision repair business.
Finance and Insurance, net-
F&I revenue, net decreased by $10.9 million (3%) in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily as a result of a 9% decrease in new and used retail unit sales partially offset by a 7% increase in F&I per vehicle retailed.
On a same store basis F&I revenue, net decreased by $12.9 million (4%) in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily as a result of a 11% decrease in new and used retail unit sales partially offset by a 8% increase in F&I per vehicle retailed.
During 2020 we continued to benefit from a favorable consumer lending environment, which allowed more of our customers to take advantage of a broader array of F&I products and our continued focus on improving the F&I results at our lower-performing stores through our F&I training programs.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense-
SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased 450 basis points from 68.4% in 2019 to 63.9% in 2020. Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased 340 basis points from 68.6% in 2019 to 65.2% in 2020. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of gross profit is the result of broad cost cutting measures implemented as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and higher gross profits on new and used vehicle sales triggered by new vehicle inventory shortages caused by pandemic related production disruptions. In addition to personnel cost savings realized as a result of headcount reductions, our cost cutting measures significantly reduced controllable expenses, such as advertising and travel. We were also able to generate savings by adjusting our loaner vehicle fleet to accommodate the COVID-19 triggered service volume downturn. We anticipate our SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit to gradually increase as new vehicle inventory levels begin to normalize in 2021.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense -
The $2.3 million (6%) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily the result of depreciation associated with dealership acquisitions during 2020, additional assets placed into service during 2020, and depreciation expense associated with the purchase of previously leased properties.
Franchise Rights Impairment -
We assessed our manufacturer franchise rights for impairment by comparing the present value of cash flows attributable to each franchise right to its carrying value. As a result of our impairment testing performed as of March 31, 2020, we recognized
a $23.0 million pretax non-cash charge related to eleven dealerships during the year ended December 31, 2020 and a $7.1 million charge as a result of our annual impairment test related to six dealerships for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Operating Expenses (Income), net -
Other operating expenses (income), net includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded other operating expense, net of $9.2 million, which included a $12.9 million related to the Park Place acquisition, $0.7 million real estate related impairment, partially offset by a $2.1 million gain related to legal settlements and a $0.3 million gain related to the sale of vacant real estate.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded expense of $0.8 million, net, which included a $2.6 million pre-tax loss related to the write-off of fixed assets, partially offset by $1.8 million, net of other non-core operating income.
Floor Plan Interest Expense -
Floor plan interest decreased by $20.2 million (53%) to $17.7 million during 2020 compared to $37.9 million during 2019, as a result of a decrease in the LIBOR rate on which our floor plan interest rate is calculated as well as generally lower new vehicle inventory levels during 2020 as a result of pandemic related production issues.
Income Tax Expense -
The $24.2 million (41%) increase in income tax expense was the result of a $94.2 million (39%) increase in income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate increased 40 basis points from 24.4% in 2019 to 24.8% in 2020. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to an increased sate rate attributed to higher apportionment in certain jurisdictions in states in which the Company has significant activity. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 25% in 2021.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2021, we had total available liquidity of $437.0 million, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents (excluding TCA), $83.5 million of available funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $270.2 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $20.6 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. The borrowing capacities under our revolving credit facility and our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility are limited by borrowing base calculations and, from time to time, may be further limited by our required compliance with certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2021, these financial covenants did not further limit our availability under our other credit facilities. For more information on our financial covenants, see "Covenants and Defaults" and "Share Repurchases and Dividend Restrictions" below.
We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand, (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations, (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility (discussed further below), (iv) amounts in our new vehicle floor plan notes payable offset accounts, and (v) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, financings, acquisitions, dispositions, equity and/or debt repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements; commitments and contingencies; debt repayment, maturity and repurchase obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.
LHM Acquisition
On December 17, 2021, the Company completed the LHM Acquisition, thereby acquiring 54 new vehicle dealerships, seven used cars stores, 11 collision centers, a used vehicle wholesale business, the real property related thereto, and the entities comprising the TCA business for a total purchase price of $3.48 billion. The real property was acquired in escrow, to be released, together with the related portion of the purchase price, subject to the satisfaction of certain title related conditions. The purchase price was financed through a combination of cash, proceeds from the issuance of common stock and borrowings including the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes and 2032 Senior Notes, the drawdown on the 2021 Real Estate Facility and the 2019 Senior Credit Facility and other floor plan borrowings.
Park Place Acquisition
On March 24, 2020, the Company delivered notice to the sellers terminating the 2019 Asset Purchase Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement related to the Park Place acquisition in exchange for the payment of $10.0 million of liquidated damages. In connection with the termination of the Transaction Agreements, the Company delivered a notice of special mandatory redemption to holders of its $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2028 (the"2028 Notes") and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2030 (the "2030 Notes") pursuant to which it redeemed on a pro rata basis (1) $245.0 million of the 2028 Notes and (2) $280.0 million of the 2030 Notes, in each case, at 100% of the respective principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the special mandatory redemption date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption").
On July 6, 2020, the Company entered into the Revised Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to the Park Place acquisition. The Park Place acquisition was completed on August 24, 2020 for a purchase price of $889.9 million. The purchase price was financed through a combination of cash, floor plan facilities and seller financing discussed in more detail below.
Material Indebtedness
We currently are party to the following material credit facilities and agreements, and have the following material indebtedness outstanding. For a more detailed description of the material terms of these agreements and facilities, and this indebtedness, see Note 14 "Debt" footnote included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•2019 Senior Credit Facility-On September 25, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the 2019 third amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the "2019 Senior Credit Facility"). In connection with LHM Acquisition, the Company entered into a 2021 Third Amendment to the 2019 Senior Credit Facility on October 29, 2021. As amended, the 2019 Senior Credit Agreement provides for the following:
Revolving Credit Facility - A $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility for, among other things, acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, including a $50.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had $10.8 million in outstanding letters of credit, $169.0 million in borrowings and $270.2 million of borrowing availability.
New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility - A $1.75 billion New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility which allows us to transfer cash as an offset to floor plan notes payable. These transfers reduce the amount of outstanding new vehicle floor plan notes payable that would otherwise accrue interest, while retaining the ability to transfer amounts from the offset account into our operating cash accounts within one to two days. As a result of the use of this floor plan offset account, we experienced a reduction in Floor Plan Interest Expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2021, we had $233.2 million outstanding under the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility, which is net of $81.5 million in our floor plan offset account.
Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility - A $350.0 million Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility to finance the acquisition of used vehicle inventory and for, among other things, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as to refinance used vehicles. We began the year with nothing drawn on our used vehicle floor plan facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had borrowings of $294.0 million on our Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. Our remaining borrowing capacity under the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility was limited to $20.6 million based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2021.
Subject to compliance with certain conditions, the 2019 Senior Credit Agreement provides that we have the ability, at our option and subject to the receipt of additional commitments from existing or new lenders, to increase the size of the facilities by up to $350.0 million in the aggregate without lender consent.
At our option, we have the ability to re-designate a portion of our availability under the Revolving Credit Facility to the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility or the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. The maximum amount we are allowed to re-designate is determined based on aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, less $50.0 million. In addition, we are able to re-designate any amounts moved to the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility or the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility back to the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2021, no availability was re-designated.
Borrowings under the 2019 Senior Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, based on LIBOR or the Base Rate, in each case, plus an Applicable Rate. The Base Rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Bank of America prime rate, and (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%. Applicable Rate means with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, a range from 1.00% to 2.00% for LIBOR loans and 0.15% to 1.00% for Base Rate loans, in each case based on the Company's consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio. Borrowings under the New Vehicle Floorplan Facility bear interest, at our option, based on LIBOR plus 1.10% or the Base Rate plus 0.10%. Borrowings under the Used Vehicle Floorplan Facility bear interest, at our option, based on LIBOR plus 1.40% or the Base Rate plus 0.40%.
In addition to the payment of interest on borrowings outstanding under the 2019 Senior Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on total unused commitments thereunder. The fee for unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility is between 0.15% and 0.40% per year, based on the Company's total lease adjusted leverage ratio, and the fee for unused commitments under the New Vehicle Facility Floor Plan and the Used Vehicle Facility Floor Plan Facility is 0.15% per year.
•Manufacturer affiliated new vehicle floor plan and other financing facilities-We have a floor plan facility with the Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit") to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicle inventory. Our floor plan facility with Ford Credit was amended in July 2020 and can be terminated by either the Company or Ford Credit with a 30-day notice period. We have also established a floor plan offset account with Ford Credit, which operates in a similar manner to our floor plan offset account with Bank of America. As of December 31, 2021, we had $37.3 million, which is net of $2.0 million in our floor plan offset account, outstanding under our floor plan facility. Additionally, we had $146.3 million, outstanding under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility and facilities with certain manufacturers for the financing of loaner vehicles, which were presented within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Neither our floor plan facility with Ford Credit nor our facilities for loaner vehicles have stated borrowing limitations.
•2029 and 2032 Senior Notes - On November 19, 2021, the Company completed its offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2032 (the “2032 Senior Notes”).

•2028 and 2030 Senior Notes-On February 19, 2020, the Company completed its offering of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2028 Notes and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2030 Notes. The 2028 Notes and 2030 Notes mature on March 1, 2028 and March 1, 2030, respectively. Interest is payable semiannually, on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2028 Notes and the 2030 Notes were offered, together with additional borrowings and cash on hand, to (i) fund the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Park Place, (ii) redeem all of our outstanding $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the "6.0% Notes") and (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing.
On March 24, 2020, the Company delivered notice to the sellers terminating the 2019 Park Place Agreements. As a result, the Company redeemed $245.0 million aggregate principal million of the 2028 Notes and $280.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes pursuant to the Special Mandatory Redemption.
In September 2020, the Company completed an add-on issuance of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional senior notes consisting of $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2028 Notes at a price of 101.00% of par, plus accrued interest from September 1, 2020, and $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2030 Notes (together with the additional 2028 Notes, the "Additional Notes") at a price of 101.75% of par, plus accrued interest from September 1, 2020 (the "September 2020 Offering"). After deducting the initial purchasers' discounts of $2.8 million, we received net proceeds of approximately $250.6 million from the September Offering. The $3.5 million premium paid by the initial purchasers of the Additional Notes was recorded as a component of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes. The proceeds of the September 2020 Offering were used to redeem the Seller Notes issued in connection with the Park Place Acquisition.
The notes of each series are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by each of our existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than the TCA Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. In addition, the notes are subject to customary covenants, events of default and optional redemption revisions.

Covenants and Defaults
We are subject to a number of customary covenants in our various debt and lease agreements, including those described below. We were in compliance with all of our covenants as of December 31, 2021. Failure to comply with any of our debt covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements, which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings, if any, unless compliance with the covenants were waived. In many cases, defaults under one of our agreements could trigger cross-default provisions in our other agreements. If we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial or other covenants, we would be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders, or we would need to raise debt and/or equity financing or sell assets to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt. We cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take any of these actions on terms, or at times, that may be necessary or desirable.
The representations and covenants contained in the 2021 Real Estate Facility, 2021 BofA Real Estate Facility, 2018 BofA Real Estate Credit Agreement, 2018 Wells Fargo Master Loan Agreement, 2013 BofA Real Estate Credit Agreement, 2015 Wells Fargo Master Loan Agreement and the related documents are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including, among others, requirements to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case, as applicable. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets. Each of these agreements provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, we could be required by the applicable agreement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding thereunder.
The representations and covenants contained in the agreement governing the 2019 Senior Credit Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature including, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the agreement governing the 2019 Senior Credit Facility. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict the Company's ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets. The agreement governing the 2019 Senior Credit Facility also
provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. In certain instances, an event of default under either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility could be, or result in, an event of default under the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility, and vice versa. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Company could be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the applicable facility.
The 2019 Senior Credit Facility and the Indentures currently allow for restricted payments without limit so long as our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Senior Credit Facility and the Indentures) is no greater than 3.0 to 1.0 after giving effect to such proposed restricted payments. Restricted payments generally include items such as dividends, share repurchases, unscheduled repayments of subordinated debt, or purchases of certain investments. Subject to our continued compliance with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Indentures, restricted payments capacity additions (or subtractions if negative) equal to a base level plus the cumulative amount of (i) 50% of our net income (as defined in the 2019 Senior Credit Facility) plus (ii) 100% of any cash proceeds we receive from the sale of equity interests minus (iii) the dollar amount of share purchases made and dividends paid during the defined measurement periods, subject to certain exceptions. In the event that our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio does (or would) exceed 3.0 to 1.0, the 2019 Senior Credit Facility and the Indentures would then also allow for restricted payments under mutually exclusive parameters, subject to certain exclusions.
Under the 2028 Senior Notes and 2030 Senior Notes, our most restrictive indentures, these parameters are:
•The Company may repurchase its own shares in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20.0 million in any fiscal year.
•The Company may otherwise make restricted payments only up the cumulative capacity above. Our restricted payment capacity balance as of December 31, 2021 was $958.6 million.
Share Repurchases and Dividend Restrictions
Our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends on our common stock is subject to our compliance with the covenants and restrictions described in "Covenants and Defaults" above.
On January 30, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the Repurchase Program. On October 19, 2018, our Board of Directors reset the authorization under our Repurchase Program to $100.0 million in the aggregate, for the repurchase of our common stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, from time to time.
During 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2021 we had remaining authorization to repurchase $100.0 million in shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program.
On February 14, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the Company’s share repurchase authorization under our Repurchase Program by $100.0 million to $200.0 million. The extent that the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions, legal requirements and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.
During 2021, we repurchased 65,937 shares of our common stock for $10.4 million from employees in connection with a net share settlement feature of employee equity-based awards.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2021, we had the following contractual obligations (in millions; note references are to the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein):
________________________________________
(a)For additional information related to the Company's operating and finance lease liabilities presented within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 19 "Leases" of the Notes thereto.
(b)Includes variable rate interest payments calculated using an estimated LIBOR rate of 0.10%, and assumes that borrowings will not be refinanced prior to or upon maturity.
Cash Flows
Classification of Cash Flows Associated with Floor Plan Notes Payable
Borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable through our 2019 Senior Credit Facility ("Non-Trade"), and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles (together referred to as "Floor Plan Notes Payable-Non-Trade"), are classified as financing activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with borrowings reflected separately from repayments. The net change in floor plan notes payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle (collectively referred to as "Floor Plan Notes Payable-Trade") is classified as an operating activity on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions and repayments made in connection with all divestitures are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory, while the latter are payable to our 2019 Senior Credit Facility that includes lenders affiliated with the manufacturers and lenders not affiliated with the manufacturers from which we purchased the related inventory. The majority of our floor plan notes are payable to our 2019 Senior Credit Facility, with the exception of floor plan notes payable relating to the financing of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles.
Floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles, and all floor plan lenders require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid within a short time period after the related vehicle is sold. As a result, we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors (i.e., if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non-trade floor plan financing as compared to us). In addition, we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our internal operating cash flow forecasts. As a result, we use the non-GAAP measure "Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities" (defined below) to compare our results to forecasts. We believe that splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities, while all new vehicle inventory activity is included in operating activities, results in significantly different operating cash flow than if all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable were classified together in operating activities.
Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities includes borrowings and repayments of Floor Plan Notes Payable Non-Trade and used floor plan notes payable borrowing base changes. Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results in accordance with GAAP. In order to compensate for these potential limitations we also review the related GAAP measures. Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 differ from previously disclosed non-gaap operating cash flow measures presented in Management's Discussion and Analysis due to the impact on operating cash flows, as reported, of the Company's material acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that the additional adjustments related to cash flows associated with our used vehicle borrowing base, floorplan offset accounts and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures eliminates cash flow volatility and provides an adjusted operating cash flow metric that best reflects our results of operations and our management of inventory and related financing activities.
We have provided below a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, as if all changes in floor plan notes payable, except for (i) borrowings associated with acquisitions and repayments associated with divestitures and (ii) borrowings and repayments associated with the purchase of used vehicle inventory and (iii) changes in the floorplan offset accounts were classified as an operating activity for both Floorplan Notes Payable - Non-Trade and Floor Plan Notes Payable - Trade.
Operating Activities-
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.16 billion, $652.5 million, and $349.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $632.1 million, $442.6 million, and $282.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities includes net income, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, changes in working capital, changes in used vehicle borrowing base, changes in Floor Plan Notes Payable - Non-Trade and Trade, excluding the impact of offsets, and excluding operating cash flows associated with acquisitions and divestitures related to loaner vehicles and new vehicle inventories financed through Floor Plan Notes Payable - Trade.
The $189.5 million increase in Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily the result of the following:
•increase in $314.2 million net income and non-cash adjustments to net income primarily related to less gain on dealership divestitures in 2021 when compared to 2020, partially offset by no franchise rights impairment in 2021; and
•$69.7 million related to sales volume and the timing of collection of accounts receivable and contracts-in-transit during 2021 as compared to 2020.
The increase in our Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities, was partially offset by:
•$67.3 million related to a decrease in inventory, net of floor plan notes payable, including both trade and non-trade, excluding offset and including used vehicle borrowing base changes adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures;
•$26.8 million related to the change in other long-term assets and liabilities;
•$43.8 million related to the change in other current assets, net; and
•$56.8 million related to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The $160.3 million increase in our Adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of the following:
•$23.6 million related to a increase in inventory, net of floor plan notes payable, including both trade and non-trade, excluding offset and including used vehicle borrowing base changes adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures;
•$57.5 million related to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities;
•$59.2 million related to non-cash adjustments to net income primarily related to the gain on dealership divestitures in 2020 when compared to 2019;
•$16.5 million related to sales volume and the timing of collection of accounts receivable and contracts-in-transit during 2020 as compared to 2019; and
•$14.3 million related to the change in other long-term assets and liabilities.
The decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, was partially offset by:
•$9.6 million related to the change in other current assets, net; and
•$1.2 million related to operating lease liabilities.
