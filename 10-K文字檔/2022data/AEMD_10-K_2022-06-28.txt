ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. The Aethlon Hemopurifier is a clinical-stage immunotherapeutic device designed to combat cancer and life-threatening viral infections. In cancer, the Hemopurifier is designed to deplete the presence of circulating tumor-derived exosomes that promote immune suppression, seed the spread of metastasis and inhibit the benefit of leading cancer therapies. The FDA, has designated the Hemopurifier as a “Breakthrough Device” for two independent indications:
· the treatment of individuals with advanced or metastatic cancer who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of standard of care therapy, and with cancer types in which exosomes have been shown to participate in the development or severity of the disease; and
· the treatment of life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies.
We believe the Hemopurifier can be a substantial advance in the treatment of patients with advanced and metastatic cancer through the clearance of exosomes that promote the growth and spread of tumors through multiple mechanisms. We are currently conducting a clinical trial in patients with advanced and metastatic head and neck cancer. We are initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors that are being treated with checkpoint inhibitors. As we advance our clinical trials, we are in close contact with our clinical sites to navigate and assess the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials and current timelines.
On October 4, 2019, the FDA approved our IDE application to initiate an EFS of the Hemopurifier in patients with head and neck cancer in combination with standard of care pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The primary endpoint for the EFS, which is designed to enroll 10 to 12 subjects at a single center, is safety, with secondary endpoints including measures of exosome clearance and characterization, as well as response and survival rates. This study is being conducted at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has treated two patients and is in the process of recruiting and treating patients.
We also believe the Hemopurifier can be part of the broad-spectrum treatment of life-threatening highly glycosylated, or carbohydrate coated, viruses that are not addressed with an already approved treatment. In small-scale or early feasibility human studies, the Hemopurifier has been used to treat individuals infected with HIV, HCV, and Ebola.
Additionally, in-vitro, the Hemopurifier has been demonstrated to capture Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, smallpox-related viruses, including Monkeypox virus, H1N1 swine flu virus, H5N1 bird flu virus, and the reconstructed Spanish flu virus of 1918. In several cases, these validations were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research institutes.
On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement to our open IDE for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in a New Feasibility Study. That study’s plan is to enroll up to 40 subjects at up to 20 centers in the U.S. Subjects will have established laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, be admitted to an intensive care unit, or ICU, and will have acute lung injury and/or severe or life threatening disease, among other criteria. Endpoints for this study, in addition to safety, will include reduction in circulating virus as well as clinical outcomes (NCT # 04595903). Under Single Patient Emergency Use regulations, the Company has also treated three patients with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier.
In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with PPD, a leading global CRO, to oversee our U.S. clinical studies investigating the Hemopurifier for critically ill COVID-19 patients. We now have nine hospitals fully activated for patient enrollment and they are actively screening patients for the trial. These sites are LSU Shreveport, Hoag Irvine and Newport Beach, Valley Baptist Medical Center in Texas, University of California Davis, University of Miami Medical Center, Loma Linda Hospital in Loma Linda, CA, Thomas Jefferson Medical Center and Cooper Medical. We are in the site activation process with additional U.S. medical centers.
We also obtained ethics review board approval and entered into a clinical trial agreement with Medanta Medicity Hospital, a multi-specialty hospital in Delhi NCR, India, for a COVID-19 clinical trial at that location. We have completed all site initiation activities at Medanta Medicity Hospital and this site is now open for enrollment and is actively screening patients.
We are also the majority owner of ESI and we consolidate ESI in our consolidated financial statements.
Successful outcomes of human trials will also be required by the regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we plan to sell the Hemopurifier, if successfully developed. Some of our patents may expire before FDA approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain patent applications and/or other patents issued more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of the Hemopurifier treatment technology.
We were formed on March 10, 1999. Our executive offices are located at 11555 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 203, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is (619) 941-0360. Our website address is www.aethlonmedical.com.
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AEMD.”
COVID-19 Update
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.
We are monitoring closely the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and have taken steps designed to protect the health and safety of our employees while continuing our operations, including clinical trials. Given the level of uncertainty regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary environment on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact of the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic, political change, and general economic uncertainty, on our future access to capital. Further, while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our manufacturing supply chain, business, results of operations, financial condition, clinical trials, or preclinical research to date, we are unable to assess the potential impact this pandemic could have on our manufacturing supply chain, business, results of operations, financial condition, clinical trials, or preclinical research in the future.
As we continue to actively advance our clinical trials, we remain in close contact with our clinical sites and are assessing the impact of COVID-19 on our trials, expected timelines and costs on an ongoing basis. We will assess any potential delays in our ability to timely ship clinical trial materials, including internationally, due to transportation interruptions. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 and inflation on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our clinical trials, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, if any.
Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
Results of Operations
Government Contract Revenues
We recorded government contract revenue in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. This revenue resulted from work performed under our government contracts with the NIH and our subaward with the University of Pittsburgh as follows:
We have recognized revenue under the following contracts/grants:
Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract
On September 12, 2019, the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, part of the NIH, awarded to us an SBIR Phase II Award Contract, for NIH/NCI Topic 359, entitled “A Device Prototype for Isolation of Melanoma Exosomes for Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring”, or the Award Contract. The Award Contract amount is $1,860,561 and, as amended, runs for the period from September 16, 2019 through September 15, 2022.
The work performed pursuant to this Award Contract focused on melanoma exosomes. This work follows from our completion of a Phase I contract for the Topic 359 solicitation that ran from September 2017 through June 2018. Following on the Phase I work, the deliverables in the Phase II program involved the design and testing of a pre-commercial prototype of a more advanced version of the exosome isolation platform.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we recorded $229,698 of government contract revenue on the Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract. That revenue related to work performed in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 that had previously been recorded as deferred revenue as a result of falling short on certain milestones. We then achieved those March period milestones in the June quarter and the June period milestones in the September quarter and therefore recorded the previously deferred revenue as government contract revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2021. We recorded the invoices related to the September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 periods as deferred revenue, since we fell short of certain milestones related to those periods.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we completed the milestones relevant to the first nine months of the fiscal year and, as a result, we recorded $436,427 of government contract revenue on the Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract in that fiscal year.
Breast Cancer Grant
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we completed and submitted the final reports applicable to this NCI grant (number 1R43CA232977-01). The title of this SBIR, Phase I grant is “The Hemopurifier Device for Targeted Removal of Breast Cancer Exosomes from the Blood Circulation,” or the Breast Cancer Grant. We note this grant because it contributed to the year over year change in revenue.
This NCI Phase I grant period originally ran from September 14, 2018 through August 31, 2019. In August 2019, we applied for and received a no cost, twelve month extension on this grant; through August 31, 2020. The total amount of the firm grant was $298,444. The grant called for two subcontractors to work with us. Those subcontractors were University of Pittsburgh and Massachusetts General Hospital.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we recorded the remaining $188,444 of revenue related to the Breast Cancer Grant, as we achieved two of the three milestones related to the Breast Cancer Grant. We concluded in our final report to the SBIR that our pre-clinical results demonstrated that our work under the grant provided support that the Hemopurifier has the capacity to clear exosomes from breast cancer patients. That amount previously was recorded as deferred revenue.
As of March 31, 2021, we received all of the funds allocated to the Breast Cancer Grant and have submitted the final reports applicable to this grant.
Subaward with University of Pittsburgh
In 2020, we entered into a cost reimbursable subaward arrangement with the University of Pittsburgh in connection with an NIH contract entitled “Depleting Exosomes to Improve Responses to Immune Therapy in HNNCC.” Our share of the award is $256,750. We recorded $64,467 and $34,233 of revenue related to this subaward in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31. 2021, respectively.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Consolidated operating expenses were $10,715,050 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, compared to $8,550,603 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $2,164,447. The $2,164,447 increase in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was due to increases in payroll and related expenses of $1,170,861 and in general and administrative expense of $997,224, which were partially offset by a decrease of $3,638 in professional fees.
The $1,170,861 increase in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 in our payroll and related expenses was due to an increase in cash-based compensation of $1,199,661, which was partially offset by a decrease in our stock-based compensation of $28,800. The $1,199,661 increase in our cash-based compensation was primarily due to increases of $826,197 and $720,863 in our general and administrative payroll and in our research and development payroll, respectively, due to headcount increases, and $202,783 in relocation-related compensation to two senior executives that relocated to San Diego, California as a condition of their employment. Those increases were partially offset by the combination of a $451,933 accrual in the 2021 period related to the separation agreement with our former CEO, with no comparable expense in the 2022 period, and a net decrease of $134,950 in cash bonuses.
The $997,224 increase in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 in our general and administrative expenses primarily arose from increases of $453,254 in our clinical trial expenses, $209,082 in rent expense and $194,572 in insurance expense.
As a result of the above factors, our net loss before noncontrolling interests increased to $10,420,885 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, from $7,891,499 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At March 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $17,072,419 and working capital of $16,332,958. This compares to a cash balance of $9,861,575 and working capital of $8,976,512 at March 31, 2021. We expect our existing cash as of March 31, 2022 to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of this Annual Report.
The primary sources of our increase in cash during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 resulted from our At The Market Offering Agreement with Wainwright dated March 22, 2021, or the 2021 ATM Agreement, and our registered direct financing through Maxim Group LLC. The cash raised from those activities is noted below:
At The Market Offering Agreements with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC
2021 ATM Agreement
On March 22, 2021, we entered into the 2021 ATM Agreement with Wainwright as sales agent, pursuant to which we could offer and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time as set forth in the 2021 ATM Agreement.
The offering was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-237269), as previously filed with the SEC and declared effective on March 30, 2020. We filed a prospectus supplement, dated March 22, 2021, with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the shares of common stock, pursuant to which we could offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $5,080,000 from time to time.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2021 ATM Agreement, Wainwright agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the shares under the 2021 ATM Agreement from time to time, based upon our instructions. We provided Wainwright with customary indemnification rights under the 2021 ATM Agreement, and Wainwright was entitled to a commission at a fixed rate equal to up to three percent of the gross proceeds per share sold. In addition, we agreed to reimburse Wainwright for certain specified expenses in connection with entering into the 2021 ATM Agreement. The 2021 ATM Agreement provided that it would terminate upon the written termination by either party as permitted thereunder.
Sales of the shares, under the 2021 ATM Agreement are made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions, including on the Nasdaq Capital Market, at market prices or as otherwise agreed with Wainwright. We have no obligation to sell any of the shares, and, at any time, we could suspend offers under the 2021 ATM Agreement or terminate the agreement.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we raised aggregate net proceeds under the 2021 ATM Agreement described above of $4,947,785, net of $126,922 in commissions to Wainwright and $2,154 in other offering expense, through the sale of 626,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $7.90 per share of net proceeds. No further sales may be made under the agreement.
2022 ATM Agreement
On March 24, 2022, we entered into the 2022 ATM Agreement with Wainwright as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time as set forth in the 2022 ATM Agreement.
The offering was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our shelf registration statement on S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-259909), as previously filed with the SEC and declared effective on October 21, 2021. We filed a prospectus supplement, dated March 24, 2022, with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the shares of common stock, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000 from time to time.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2022 ATM Agreement, Wainwright has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the shares under the 2022 ATM Agreement from time to time, based upon our instructions. We have provided Wainwright with customary indemnification rights under the 2022 ATM Agreement, and Wainwright is entitled to a commission at a fixed rate equal to up to three percent of the gross proceeds per share sold. In addition, we agreed to reimburse Wainwright for certain specified expenses in connection with entering into the 2022 ATM Agreement. The 2022 ATM Agreement provides that it will terminate upon the written termination by either party as permitted thereunder.
Sales of the shares, under the 2022 ATM Agreement will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions, including on the Nasdaq Capital Market, at market prices or as otherwise agreed with Wainwright. We have no obligation to sell any of the shares, and, at any time, we could suspend offers under the 2022 ATM Agreement or terminate the agreement.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we did not raise any proceeds under the 2022 ATM Agreement.
In June 2022, we raised net proceeds of $448,760, net of $11,583 in commissions to Wainwright and $2,994 in other offering expense, through the sale of 411,055 shares of our common stock at an average price of $1.09 per share under the 2022 ATM Agreement.
Registered Direct Financing
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we sold an aggregate of 1,380,555 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of $9.00, for aggregate net proceeds to us of $11,659,044, after deducting fees payable to Maxim Group LLC, the placement agent, and other offering expenses. These shares were sold through a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, The shares were issued pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was originally filed with the SEC on March 19, 2020, and was declared effective on March 30, 2020 (File No. 333-237269) and a prospectus supplement thereunder.
Material Cash Requirements
As noted above in the results of operations, our clinical trial expense increased by $453,254 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We expect our clinical trial expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Those increases in clinical trial expenses include the cost of manufacturing additional Hemopurifiers for the clinical trials.
In addition, we have entered into leases for our new headquarters, laboratory and manufacturing facilities. As noted above in the results of operations, our rent expense increased by $209,082 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We expect our rent expense to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
Future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, the number and breadth of our clinical programs, the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, competing technological and market developments, as well as our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, effective commercialization, marketing activities and other arrangements. We expect to continue to incur increasing negative cash flows and net losses for the foreseeable future. We will continue to need to raise additional capital either through equity and/or debt financing for the foreseeable future.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, global events and political changes, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. If equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows (in thousands):
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
We used cash in our operating activities due to our losses from operations. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $9,767,000 in fiscal 2022, compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately $6,765,000 in fiscal 2021, an increase of approximately $3,002,000. The primary factors in this $3,002,000 increase in cash used in operations in fiscal 2022 was a $2,530,000 increase in our net loss.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased approximately $349,000 and $60,000 of equipment, respectively.
Net Cash from Financing Activities
Net cash generated from financing activities increased from approximately $7,128,000 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 to approximately $17,368,000 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we raised approximately $17,456,000 from the issuance of common stock, which was partially offset by the use of approximately $88,000 to pay for the tax withholding on the issuance of restricted stock units, or RSUs. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we raised approximately $7,261,000 from the issuance of common stock, which was partially offset by the use of approximately $133,000 to pay for the tax withholding on the issuance of RSUs.
Recent Events
Sales Under 2022 ATM Agreement
In June 2022, we raised net proceeds of $448,760 net of $11,583 in commissions to Wainwright and $2,994 in other offering expense, through the sale of 411,055 shares of our common stock at an average price of $1.09 per share under the 2022 ATM Agreement.
RSU Grants
The Compensation Committee, or the Compensation Committee, of the Board of Directors of the Company, or Board, approved, effective as of April 1, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors Compensation Policy, which was most recently amended on February 10, 2022, or the Director Compensation Policy, the grant of the annual RSUs under the Director Compensation Policy to each of the two non-employee directors of the Company then serving on the Board and a new grant for the newly appointed director, with each such grant subject to stockholder approval of an increase of 1,800,000 shares of common stock in the number of authorized shares of common stock, or the 2022 Plan Increase, available for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2020 Plan, at the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, or the 2022 Annual Meeting. The Director Compensation Policy provides for a grant of stock options or $50,000 worth of RSUs at the beginning of each fiscal year for current directors then serving on the Board and for a grant of stock options or $75,000 worth of RSUs for a newly elected director, with the RSUs priced at the average for the closing prices for the five days preceding and including the date of grant, or $1.46 per share as of April 1, 2022. The two then-current eligible directors each was granted a contingent RSU in the amount of 34,247 shares under the 2020 Plan and the newly appointed director received a contingent RSU grant for 51,370 shares under the 2020 Plan. The contingent RSUs are subject to vesting in three installments, 50% on September 30, 2022, and 25% on each of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023, subject to stockholder approval of the 2022 Plan Increase at the 2022 Annual Meeting and subject to the recipient's continued service with the Company on each such vesting date.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition, stock purchase warrants issued with notes payable, beneficial conversion feature of convertible notes payable, impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets, stock compensation, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and contingencies.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues consist entirely of amounts earned under contracts and grants with the NIH. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenues totaling $294,165 and $659,104, respectively, under such contracts. We have concluded that these agreements are not within the scope of ASC Topic, 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606, as the NIH grants and contracts do not meet the definition of a “customer” as defined by Topic 606. Prior to the effective date of ASC Topic 606, which for the Company was April 1, 2018, we accounted for our grant/contract revenues under the Milestone Method as prescribed by the legacy guidance of ASC 605-28, Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method, or the Milestone Method. In the absence of other applicable guidance under US GAAP, effective April 1, 2018, we elected to continue to use the Milestone Method by analogy to recognize revenue under these grants/contracts.
Common Stock Warrants
In the past, we have granted warrants to purchase our common stock in connection with financing transactions. When such warrants are classified as equity, we measure the relative estimated fair value of such warrants which represents a discount from the face amount of the notes payable. Such discounts are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. We analyze such warrants for classification as either equity or derivative liabilities and value them based on binomial lattice models.
Share-based Compensation
We account for share-based compensation awards using the fair-value method and record such expense based on the grant date fair value in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period.
Derivative Instruments
We evaluate free-standing derivative instruments (or embedded derivatives) to properly classify such instruments within equity or as liabilities in our financial statements. Our policy is to settle instruments indexed to our common shares on a first-in-first-out basis.
The classification of a derivative instrument is reassessed at each reporting date. If the classification changes as a result of events during a reporting period, the instrument is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. There is no limit on the number of times a contract may be reclassified.
Instruments classified as derivative liabilities are remeasured each reporting period (or upon reclassification) and the change in fair value is recorded on our consolidated statement of operations in other expense (income). We had no derivative instruments at March 31, 2022 or March 31, 2021.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax basis. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes, and (b) tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when, based on our best estimate of taxable income (if any) in the foreseeable future, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.
Convertible Notes Payable
There were no convertible notes outstanding as of March 31, 2022 or 2021.
RSU Grants to Non-Employee Directors
The Company maintains the Director Compensation Policy which provides for cash and equity compensation for persons serving as non-employee directors of the Company. Under this policy, each new director receives either stock options or a grant of RSUs upon appointment/election, as well as an annual grant of stock options or of RSUs at the beginning of each fiscal year. The (i) stock options are subject to vesting and (ii) RSUs are subject to vesting and represent the right to be issued on a future date shares of our common stock upon vesting.
On April 1, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Director Compensation Policy, the Compensation Committee granted RSUs under the 2020 Plan, to each non-employee director of the Company. The Director Compensation Policy provides for a grant of stock options or $50,000 worth of RSUs at the beginning of each fiscal year, with the RSUs priced at the average for the closing prices for the five days preceding and including the date of grant, or $2.06 per share as of April 1, 2021. Each eligible director was granted an RSU in the amount of 24,295 shares under the 2020 Plan. The RSUs were subject to vesting in four equal quarterly installments on June 30, September 30, December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2022, subject to the recipient’s continued service with the Company on each such vesting date.
In June 2021, 18,221 vested RSUs held by our non-employee directors were exchanged into the same number of shares of our common stock. All three non-employee directors elected to return 40% of their vested RSUs in exchange for cash, in order to pay their withholding taxes on the share issuances, resulting in 7,289 of the vested RSUs being cancelled in exchange for $35,786 in aggregate cash proceeds to those independent directors.
In September 2021, 18,221 vested RSUs held by our non-employee directors were exchanged into the same number of shares of our common stock. All three non-employee directors elected to return 40% of their vested RSUs in exchange for cash, in order to pay their withholding taxes on the share issuances, resulting in 7,289 of the vested RSUs being cancelled in exchange for $28,134 in aggregate cash proceeds to those independent directors.
In December 2021, 18,221 vested RSUs held by our non-employee directors were exchanged into the same number of shares of our common stock.
