ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Formation
We are a Nevada corporation formed on December 31, 2003 (although we were incorporated on October 9, 1995 in Texas under the name, Posh International, Inc. and on December 31, 2003, we changed our domicile from Texas to Nevada). Our headquarters are in Coconut Creek, FL.
Overview
We have experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, including in our current business model. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we ramp up our expansion, which likely will lead to additional losses, until such time that we approach profitability, or which there are no assurances. We have relied on equity and debt financing to fund operations. There can be no guarantee that we will ever become profitable, or that adequate additional financing will be realized in the future or otherwise may be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay development of our operations. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, of which there are no assurances.
We are a Nevada corporation publicly traded company under the ticker “IGPK”. We were formed on December 31, 2003 and had nominal operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We plan to process hemp or biomass into Cannabidilol (“CBD”) by establishing a processing plant in Wisconsin to supply manufacturers or pharmaceutical companies for their manufacture, distribution and sale of CBD related products such as edibles for human consumption, vitamins, and multi-vitamins, and topical products for human use such as oils, tinctures, creams, oils and salves, and vaping liquids. We also plan to promote and assist in the establishment of a co-op with local farmers for the purpose of establishing a consistent supply of biomass and enter into long term supply contracts. On May 21, 2019, the Company formed Integrated Farming Solutions, LLC as a limited liability company, in the state of Nevada. Integrated Farming Solutions, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary and has not yet begun operations.
On December 13, 2021, we completed an agreement with Consolidated Apparel to acquire 100% of Consolidated and pursue the athleisure apparel business, which has not yet closed.
No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in implementing and executing our business plans.
Trends and Uncertainties
Our business is subject to the following trends and uncertainties:
·
State and Federal laws regarding growing and processing industrial hemp; currently hemp is legal to be grown in all 50 States pursuant to the 2018 Farm Act signed into law in July of 2018.
·
With the passing of the Farm Act, more growers have entered the market causing the price of refined hemp to drop; we believe this will continue to drop for another year before the market stabilizes
·
Testing requirements have and will continue to evolve meaning less Biomass maybe available to refine designated as pharmaceutical grade
·
Weather is a major factor, with wild climate swings taking place this could also cause a shortage in available Biomass. Earlier this year in Colorado, the largest grower of cannabis plants lost their entire crop to a freeze.
Going Concern
At December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,058,651 and we have yet to commence our plan of operations. Our current liquidity resources are not sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations for at least the next 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued. As a result, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’ ability to continue as a going concern.
Our ability to continue operations depends on its ability to generate and grow revenue and results of operations as well as its ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish its strategic objectives. We expect that we will continue to incur losses for the immediate future and will need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities. Our future capital requirements for its operations will depend on many factors, including the ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital. There is no assurance that we will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that it may undertake to fund operations and implement its business plan in the future.
Our plans to implement our Plan of Operations include the following:
·
Renting space in an area in Wisconsin where we can setup a processing lab and start processing some of the Biomass harvested during 2019.
·
Once the processing lab is set up, we will meet with farmers in the area growing hemp and seek to form a co-op with them, where they farm the crop, and we process the crop and sell the Isolate.
The foregoing goals will increase expenses and lead to possible net losses. There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance we will be successful in any of these goals.
Results of Operations
The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. We have not generated any revenues from inception to date. We anticipate that we may not receive any significant revenues from operations until we begin our planned operations to process hemp or biomass into Cannabidiol (“CBD”) by establishing a processing plant in Wisconsin to supply manufacturers or pharmaceutical companies for their manufacture, distribution and sale of CBD related products such as edibles for human consumption, vitamins, and multi-vitamins, and topical products for human use such as oils, tinctures, creams, oils and salves, and vaping liquids. We also plan to promote and assist in the establishment of a co-op with local farmers for the purpose of establishing a consistent supply of biomass and enter into long term supply contracts.
For the Years Ended December 31, 2021, and 2020.
Revenues
We had no revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $326,887 and $320,500, respectively, representing a $6,387 increase in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. Our salaries and wages of $180,000 remained the same for FY 2021 and FY 2020. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12,756 in FY 2021 from FY 2020 offset by our professional and legal fees decreasing by $6,369 in FY 2021 from FY 2020.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense of $46,971 and $25,683 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, increased by $21,288 in FY 2021 from FY 2020. The increase in interest expense is attributable to a $208,451 increase in notes payable and advances from officers subject to interest in FY2021 from FY 2020.
Net Loss
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized net losses of $373,858 and $346,183, respectively, representing an increase in net losses of $27,675. The increase of $27,675 of net losses are attributable to the $6,387 increase in operating expenses from FY2021 from FY2020 and the $21,288 increase in interest expenses in FY2021 from FY2020.
We anticipate losses from operations will increase during the next twelve months due to anticipated increased payroll expenses as we add necessary staff and increases in legal and accounting expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company. We expect that we will continue to have net losses from operations for several years until revenues from operating facilities become sufficient to offset operating expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have generated no revenues since inception. We have obtained cash for operating expenses mainly through advances and/or notes from affiliates and stockholders.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net cash used in operating activities was $208,451 and $158,058, respectively, representing an increase of $50,393 in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. The increase is mainly due to the $27,675 increase in net loss, as well as a $4,000 in increase in prepaid assets and $18,718 decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. Our primary uses of funds in operations were payments made for legal and professional costs.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.
Our net cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $208,451 and $158,058, respectively, representing a $50,393 increase in net cash provided by financing activities in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. The $50,393 increase is attributable to a $132,588 increase in proceeds from issuance of notes payable, offset by an $82,195 decrease in advances from officer in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020.
Total Liabilities
Total liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $1,069,951 and $689,093, respectively, composed exclusively of current liabilities and representing a $380,858 increase in total liabilities in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. The $380,858 increase in total liabilities is composed of: (a) $172,407 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses; (b) $164,583 increase in notes payable; and (c) $43,868 increase in advances from officer.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships
Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
The following significant accounting policies require management estimates and assumptions which may result in material impacts to the Company’s financial condition.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has incurred net operating loss for financial-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. Accordingly, for Federal and state income tax purposes, the benefit for income taxes has been offset entirely by a valuation allowance against the related federal and state deferred tax asset for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:
●
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
●
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
●
Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.
The carrying value of prepaid assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and advances from officer approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of those items. No other assets or liabilities were required to be recorded at fair value either on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
