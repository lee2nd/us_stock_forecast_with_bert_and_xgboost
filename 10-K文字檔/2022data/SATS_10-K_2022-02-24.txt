EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We are an industry leader in both networking technologies and services, innovating to deliver the global solutions that power a connected future for people, enterprises and things everywhere. We provide broadband satellite technologies, broadband internet services for consumer customers, which include home and small to medium-sized businesses, satellite services and solutions for enterprise customers, which include aeronautical and government enterprises.
We currently operate in two business segments: Hughes segment and ESS segment. These segments are consistent with the way we make decisions regarding the allocation of resources, as well as how operating results are reviewed by our CODM, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
Our operations include various corporate departments (primarily Executive, Treasury, Strategic Development, Human Resources, Information Technology, Finance, Accounting, Real Estate and Legal) and other activities, such as costs incurred in certain satellite development programs and other business development activities, and gains or losses from certain of our investments, that have not been assigned to our business segments. These activities, costs and income, as well as eliminations of intersegment transactions, are accounted for in our Corporate and Other segment in our segment reporting.
In September 2019, pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement with DISH and the Merger Sub, we completed the BSS Transaction.
In connection with the BSS Transaction, we and DISH Network agreed to indemnify each other against certain losses with respect to breaches of certain representations and covenants and certain retained and assumed liabilities, respectively. Refer to Note 19 in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on certain customary agreements entered into with DISH in relation to the BSS Transaction.
The BSS Transaction was structured in a manner intended to be tax-free to us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes and was accounted for as a spin-off to our shareholders as we did not receive any consideration. Following the consummation of the BSS Transaction, we no longer operate the BSS Business, which was a substantial portion of our ESS segment. As a result of the BSS Transaction, the financial results of the BSS Business, except for certain real estate that transferred in the transaction, are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, excluded from continuing operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2019 in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 5 in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations.
Highlights from our financial results are as follows:

Hughes Segment
Our Hughes segment is an industry leader in both networking technologies and services, innovating to deliver the global solutions that power a connected future for people, enterprises and things everywhere. We provide broadband satellite technologies and broadband internet products and services to consumer customers. We provide broadband network technologies, managed services, equipment, hardware, satellite services and communications solutions to government and enterprise customers. We also design, provide and install gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems. In addition, we design, develop, construct and provide telecommunication networks comprising satellite ground segment systems and terminals to mobile system operators and our enterprise customers.
Our Hughes segment incorporates advances in technology to reduce costs and to increase the functionality and reliability of our products and services. Through advanced and proprietary methodologies, technologies, software and techniques, we continue to improve the efficiency of our networks. We invest in technologies to enhance our system and network management capabilities, specifically our managed services for enterprises. We also continue to invest in next generation technologies that can be applied to our future products and services.
Our Hughes segment continues to focus our efforts on optimizing financial returns of our existing satellites while planning for new satellite capacity to be launched, leased or acquired. In addition, we are also pursuing wireline and wireless capacity to utilize in markets that include residential, community WiFi, backhaul, and other enterprise broadband and multi-transport services. Our consumer revenue growth depends on our success in adding new and retaining existing subscribers, as well as increasing our ARPU. Service and acquisition costs related to ongoing support for our direct and indirect customers and partners are typically impacted most significantly by our growth. The growth of both our enterprise and consumer businesses rely heavily on global economic conditions and the competitive landscape for pricing relative to competitors and alternative technologies.
Our Hughes segment currently uses capacity from our owned and leased satellites, including additional satellite capacity leased from third-party providers to provide services to our customers. We also use other multi-transport capacity that includes cable, fiber, 5G, and 4G/LTE. Growth of our consumer subscriber base in the U.S. continues to be constrained where we are nearing or have reached maximum capacity in most areas. Our Latin America consumer subscriber base in certain areas has also become capacity constrained. These constraints are not expected to be resolved until we acquire additional capacity.
In May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Yahsat pursuant to which, in November 2019, Yahsat contributed its satellite communications services business in Brazil to one of our Brazilian subsidiaries in exchange for a 20% ownership interest in that subsidiary. The combined business provides broadband internet services and enterprise solutions in Brazil using the Telesat T19V satellite, the Eutelsat 65W satellite and Yahsat’s Al Yah 3 satellite. Under the terms of the agreement, Yahsat may also acquire, for further cash investments, additional minority ownership interests in the business in the future provided certain conditions are met.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED
In May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Bharti, pursuant to which Bharti will contribute its VSAT telecommunications services and hardware business in India to our two existing Indian subsidiaries that conduct our VSAT services and hardware business. On January 4, 2022, the formation of this joint venture was announced, with Bharti obtaining a 33% ownership interest in the combined business. The joint venture combines the VSAT businesses of both companies to offer flexible and scalable enterprise networking solutions using satellite connectivity for primary transport, back-up and hybrid implementation.
In August 2017, we entered into a long-term contract for the design and construction of the EchoStar XXIV satellite, a new, next-generation, high throughput geostationary satellite. The EchoStar XXIV satellite is primarily intended to provide additional capacity for our HughesNet service in North, Central and South America as well as enterprise broadband services. The EchoStar XXIV satellite is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. Further delays or impediments could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, future revenues, financial position and prospects, the completion of manufacture of the EchoStar XXIV satellite and our planned expansion of satellite broadband services throughout North, South and Central America. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with a launch provider for the launch of EchoStar XXIV. Capital expenditures associated with the construction and launch of the EchoStar XXIV satellite are included in our Corporate and Other segment in our segment reporting.
Our broadband subscribers include customers that subscribe to our HughesNet services in the U.S. and Latin America through retail, wholesale and small/medium enterprise service channels.
The following table presents our approximate number of broadband subscribers:
The following table presents the approximate number of net subscriber additions for each quarter in 2021:
Our U.S. consumer subscriber base in certain areas continues to be capacity constrained and we are managing the available capacity to maintain service quality to our existing subscribers. Balancing of total subscribers relative to capacity utilization in the fourth quarter resulted in lower total subscribers. During the fourth quarter, the lower net subscribers were due to both lower gross additions and higher churn as compared to the third quarter.
Our Latin America consumer subscriber base in certain areas, similar to the U.S., has also become capacity constrained. Continued high bandwidth demand in certain areas has resulted in managing subscriber growth, and similar to the U.S. we are balancing capacity utilization with subscriber levels in the impacted areas which resulted in lower total subscribers. During the fourth quarter, the lower net subscribers were due to both lower gross additions and higher churn as compared to the third quarter.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our Hughes segment had $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of contracted revenue backlog, respectively. We define Hughes segment contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue under enterprise customer contracts that are non-cancelable, including lease revenue. Our contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2021 changed primarily due to an increase in contracts from our international customers. Of the total Hughes segment contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2021, we expect to recognize $506.1 million of revenue in 2022.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED
ESS Segment
Our ESS segment provides satellite services on a full-time and/or occasional-use basis to U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, content providers and private enterprise customers. We operate our ESS business using primarily the EchoStar IX satellite and the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite and related infrastructure. Revenue in our ESS segment depends largely on our ability to continuously make use of our available satellite capacity with existing customers and our ability to enter into commercial relationships with new customers. Our ESS segment, like others in the fixed satellite services industry, has encountered, and may continue to encounter, negative pressure on transponder rates and demand.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our ESS segment had contracted revenue backlog of $10.4 million and $6.7 million, respectively. We define contracted revenue backlog for our ESS segment as contracted future satellite lease revenue. Our contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2021, changed due to an increase in satellite service contracts with existing and new customers. Of the total ESS segment contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2021, we expect to recognize $5.9 million of revenue in 2022.
Other Business Opportunities
Our industry continues to evolve with the increasing worldwide demand for broadband internet access for information, entertainment and commerce. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made even more evident the worldwide need and demand for connectivity and communications to facilitate an ever-increasing virtual global community and workplace. In addition to fiber and wireless systems, technologies such as geostationary high throughput satellites, LEO networks, MEO systems and multi-transport networks using combinations of technologies are expected to continue to play significant roles in enabling global broadband access, networks and services. We intend to use our expertise, technologies, capital, investments, global presence, relationships and other capabilities to continue to provide broadband internet systems, equipment, networks and services for information, the internet-of-things, entertainment, education, remote-connectivity and commerce across industries and communities globally for consumer and enterprise customers. We are closely tracking the developments in next-generation satellite businesses, and we are seeking to utilize our services, technologies, licenses and expertise to find new commercial opportunities for our business.
We intend to continue to selectively explore opportunities to pursue investments, commercial alliances, partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic initiatives and transactions, domestically and internationally, that we believe may allow us to increase our existing market share, increase our satellite capacity, expand into new satellite and other technologies, markets and customers, broaden our portfolio of services, products and intellectual property, make our business more valuable, align us for future growth and expansion, maximize the return on our investments and strengthen our business and relationships with our customers. We may allocate or dispose of significant resources for long-term value that may not have a short or medium-term or any positive impact on our revenue, results of operations, or cash flow.
S-Band Strategy
We continue to explore the development and deployment of S-band technologies that we expect will reduce the cost of satellite communications for internet of things, machine-to-machine communications, public protection, disaster relief and other end-to-end services worldwide and the integration of our products and services into new global, hybrid networks that leverage multiple satellites and terrestrial technologies. We believe we remain in a unique position to develop a hybrid MSS and CGC network in the E.U., the U.K. and other European countries, including through the use of our EchoStar XXI satellite, which was placed into service in November 2017, and the EUTELSAT 10A payload. We have positioned ourselves to continue to develop the S-band spectrum globally by acquiring Sirion Global Pty Ltd., which we have renamed EchoStar Global which holds global S-band non-geostationary satellite spectrum rights for MSS. Additionally, we entered into a contract with Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. for the design and construction of S-band nano-satellites. We launched two nano-satellites in the third quarter of 2020. Following launch, both nano-satellites experienced technical anomalies that precluded them from fulfilling their intended regulatory milestone missions. We obtained milestone relief due to these force majeure events. In the second quarter of 2021, we launched our third nano-satellite. The nano-satellite was successfully commissioned
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED
and placed at the altitude prescribed in our license for the S-band frequency. We have completed the process of fulfilling the remaining requirements under the ITU Radio Regulations of bringing the Australian filing into use. The nano-satellite will now be used to develop and test a wide range of potential S-band applications and services. We also hold licenses for S-band MSS and terrestrial services in Mexico.
Cybersecurity
We and the third parties whom we work with face a constantly evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats in which hackers and other parties use complex assortments of techniques and methods to execute cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents have increased significantly in quantity and severity and are expected to continue to increase. In addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber-attacks, we are making investments to alleviate the potential impact to our products. As a result of these efforts, we could discover new vulnerabilities within our products and systems. We may not discover all such vulnerabilities due to the scale of activities on our platforms, or due to other factors, including but not limited to issues outside of our control. In addition, our IT systems and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious acts, human errors and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and backup measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.
We are not aware of any cyber-incidents with respect to our owned or leased satellites or other networks, equipment or systems that have had a material adverse effect on our business, costs, operations, prospects, results of operation or financial position during the year ended December 31, 2021 and through February 24, 2022. There can be no assurance, however, that any such incident can be detected or thwarted or will not have such a material adverse effect in the future.
