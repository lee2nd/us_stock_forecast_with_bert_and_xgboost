Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains certain statements that are not strictly historical and are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to other risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this section are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement, except as required by law.
Company Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel life-saving therapies for life-threatening diseases or other public health threats for civilian, government and military use. Our United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved commercial product, NUZYRA® (omadacycline) is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and acute skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused by susceptible pathogens. We retain worldwide commercial rights to omadacycline, with the exception in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, where we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai. The National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, of China approved NUZYRA for the treatment of CABP and ABSSSI in December 2021. 
SEYSARA® (sarecycline) is an FDA-approved product with respect to which we have exclusively licensed in the U.S. and the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau, or the greater China region, certain rights to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall. SEYSARA is currently being marketed by Almirall in the U.S. as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. With respect to our technology as it relates to sarecycline, we retain development and commercialization rights in all countries other than the U.S. and the greater China region, and in February 2020, we exclusively licensed from Almirall certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates that is necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. Almirall plans to develop sarecycline for acne in China, with a submission to the China National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, according to Almirall, expected in 2023.
We believe that NUZYRA has the potential to become the primary choice of physicians for use as a broad-spectrum monotherapy antibiotic for ABSSSI, CABP and other serious community-acquired bacterial infections where resistance is of concern. NUZYRA is used in the emergency room, hospital, and community care settings. We have designed NUZYRA to provide potential advantages over existing antibiotics, including activity against resistant bacteria, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, oral and IV formulations with once-daily dosing, no dosing adjustments for patients on concomitant medications and a generally safe and well-tolerated profile. NUZYRA also has the potential to be used as an oral and IV antibiotic for the treatment of NTM and pulmonary anthrax, where it could be suitable for post-exposure prophylaxis use as a priority medical countermeasure.
Financial Operations Overview
Product Revenue, Net
Product revenue, net, is recognized when earned on sales of NUZYRA, which was approved by the FDA in October 2018 and launched in the U.S. in February 2019. NUZYRA is sold principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell our product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product. Product revenue is recognized net of reserves for all variable consideration, including rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns.
Under the terms of the BARDA contract, BARDA can procure up to 10,000 anthrax treatment courses of NUZYRA. As of December 31, 2021, the initial 2,500 treatment courses of NUZYRA were purchased by BARDA. The product procurement performance obligations generate revenue at a point in time, which will be upon transfer of control of the product. As such, the related revenue for these performance obligations is recognized at a point in time as product revenue within our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.
Government Contract Service Revenue
Government contract service revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for work performed to develop NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax plus a small fixed administrative fee. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.
Government Contract Grant Revenue
The allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the approval of NUZYRA, including CABP and pediatric studies, as well as a five-year post-marketing bacterial surveillance study. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.
Collaboration and Royalty Revenue
Collaboration and royalty revenue are recognized when revenue earned under our collaboration and license agreements. Refer to Note 6, License and Collaboration Agreements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the collaboration agreements and the related revenue recognition.
Cost of Product Revenue
Cost of product revenue represents the cost of the product itself, labor and overhead, and any reserve for excess or obsolete inventory, as well as stability studies, inventory scrap and royalty expense. Cost of product revenue also represents royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs directly incurred by us for the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials;
•
the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical study materials and developing manufacturing processes;
•
direct employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense of our research and development personnel;
•
allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and
•
costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory compliance.
Research and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred related to research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.
We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our products or product candidates for which we or any partner obtain regulatory approval, such as NUZYRA and SEYSARA. Aside from the FDA approval of NUZYRA and SEYSARA in the U.S., we or our partners may never succeed in achieving other regulatory approvals for NUZYRA, or any of our other product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development activities;
•
future clinical trial results;
•
potential changes in government regulation; and
•
the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that therapeutic candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority, were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of the clinical development of product candidates, or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
We manage certain activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacture of clinical trial material, and preclinical animal toxicology studies, through third-party contract organizations. The only costs we track by each product candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by CROs, manufacturing of preclinical and clinical drug product, and other outsourced research and development expenses. We do not assign or allocate to individual development programs internal costs such as salaries and benefits, facilities costs, lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies. Our research and development expenses for omadacycline and other projects during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation costs associated with our contract sales force, commercial support personnel, and medical affairs professionals, as well as personnel in executive and other administrative functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, trade, and other commercial costs and distribution fees necessary to support the launch of NUZYRA and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.
Interest Income
Interest income represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense represents interest incurred on the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the Notes, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement (each as defined in Note 13, Long-Term Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), as well as the adjustment of our marketable securities to amortized cost.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Product Revenue, Net
Net product revenue recognized on sales of NUZYRA in the U.S. was $106.1 million and $38.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in net product revenue is primarily the result of the delivery and acceptance of the first procurement of NUZYRA under the BARDA contract of $37.9 million and an increase in sales volume due to higher customer demand.
Government Contract Service Revenue
Government contract service revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $6.6 million and $3.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in government contract service revenue is primarily the result of increased costs incurred for the U.S. onshoring of NUZYRA manufacturing.
Government Contract Grant Revenue
Government contract grant revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $9.2 million and $3.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in government contract service revenue is primarily the result of increased costs incurred to support existing FDA PMRs.
Collaboration and Royalty Revenue
Collaboration and royalty revenue were $8.2 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Under the terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement, we earned a milestone payment of $6.0 million upon regulatory approval of NUZYRA in the People’s Republic of China in December 2021. Royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third-party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which we then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.
Cost of Product Revenue
Cost of product revenue was $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $12.8 million increase is primarily the result of the delivery and acceptance of the first procurement of NUZYRA under the BARDA contract, an increase in NUZYRA product sales and an increase in royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of NUZYRA units recognized as revenue during years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were expensed prior to FDA approval in October 2018, and therefore are not included in cost of product revenue during the periods. We expect cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as product revenue increases.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses were $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $6.5 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased costs reimbursed under the BARDA contract, which included costs for the U.S. onshoring of NUZYRA manufacturing and for FDA PMRs associated with the approval of NUZYRA, compensation expense for the first tranche of our Revenue Performance Incentive Plan recognized when the related performance condition was deemed probable during 2021, and costs incurred for the Phase 2b NTM study. Refer to Note 15, Stock Based and Incentive Compensation, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our Revenue Performance Incentive Plan. We anticipate an increase in research and development expenses in future periods as we continue development of NUZYRA for the treatment of and PEP against pulmonary anthrax, continue the work on our FDA PMRs, and continue the onshoring of our manufacturing process, the majority of which is reimbursable under the BARDA contract. We will also incur additional spend as we continue exploring pathways for NTM indications.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $29.5 million increase is primarily the result of compensation expense for the first tranche of our Revenue Performance Incentive Plan recognized when the related performance condition was deemed probable during 2021, costs incurred for the NUZYRA community expansion, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to the probability and timing of the achievement of performance-based vesting milestones. Refer to Note 15, Stock Based and Incentive Compensation, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our Revenue Performance Incentive Plan.
We anticipate an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in support of our expansion into the community setting and other commercial activities, as well as the continued costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include costs for travel, in-person training events and sales meetings, the hiring of additional personnel, executing marketing and promotional programs, and engaging consultants, legal and other professional fees, and other operating expenses.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.8 million, R-Bridge Loan Agreement of $4.5 million, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $4.1 million, and insignificant interest expense related to our money market funds and marketable securities. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $0.1 million. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.8 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $7.3 million, the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $4.0 million and interest expense related to our money market funds and marketable securities of $0.1 million. Interest
income for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $1.5 million.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
On December 31, 2020, we used the proceeds from the sale of the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest from the R-Bridge Loan Agreement (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement. Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement qualified as an extinguishment of debt on the date the payment was made in satisfaction of all amounts due and we were unconditionally relieved of our obligations therein. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million was calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt, which includes any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs.
Provision for income taxes
Provision for taxes incurred in connection with $6.0 million milestone earned upon regulatory approval of NUZYRA in the People’s Republic of China under our Zai Collaboration Agreement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On May 11, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as amended on June 19, 2020 and declared effective on July 9, 2020, to sell certain of our securities in an aggregate amount of up to $250.0 million. As of February 28, 2022, $229.5 million remains available on this shelf registration statement, with $29.5 million reserved for potential sales under our Sales Agreement (as defined below).On May 17, 2021, we entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with BTIG, LLC, or BTIG, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million from time to time through BTIG as our sales agent. Sales of our common stock through BTIG, if any, will be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation sales made directly on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other existing trading market for its common stock. BTIG will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We will pay BTIG a commission of 3% of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through BTIG under the Sales Agreement. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we sold 3,175,657 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement for $18.64 million in proceeds, after deducting an insignificant amount of commissions. As of February 28, 2022, $29.5 million remains available for sale under the Sales Agreement.
We have used and we intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the above offerings of our common stock and the Notes, as well as other current and retired long-term debt agreements, together with our existing capital resources and future NUZYRA product sales, government contract revenue and royalty revenue, to fund our ongoing company operations, including clinical studies of omadacycline, NUZYRA commercial operations, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 16, Long-Term Debt, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our loan agreements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $95.5 million.
The following table summarizes our cash provided by and (used in) operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of our net losses adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of operating assets and liabilities as follows:
•
For the year ended December 31, 2021, a net loss of $59.1 million was adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $14.3 million, non-cash interest expense of $4.3 million, and a net increase of $8.2 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities include a combined increase in accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, and inventory of $37.3 million, which was partially offset by a combined decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily associated with obligations under the Revenue Incentive Plan, and other assets of $29.1 million.
•
For the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $96.5 million was adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.5 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million, and a net decrease of $20.3 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities include an increase in accounts receivable, other receivables, prepaid, and other current assets of $7.5 million and an increase in inventories of $11.8 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 consists of $20.0 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by $15.1 million of investments in marketable securities (U.S. treasury securities) and $0.4 million in purchases of fixed assets.
Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of $122.5 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by $29.6 million of investments in marketable securities (U.S. treasury securities) and $0.4 million in purchases of fixed assets.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2021 includes the following:
•
$18.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock through the Sales Agreement;
•
$0.7 million in proceeds from the Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2018 ESPP; offset by
•
$0.4 million in debt issuance costs under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement; and
•
$0.3 million in principal payments on long-term debt under our R-Bridge Loan Agreement.
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2020 includes the following:
•
$58.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement;
•
$21.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock through the Sales Agreement;
•
$0.6 million in proceeds from the 2018 ESPP;
•
$0.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options; offset by
•
$70.0 million in principal debt payments on long-term debt.
Future Funding Requirements
We began generating revenue from product sales when we launched NUZYRA in the U.S. in February 2019 and from royalties on net sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. when Almirall launched the product in January 2019. Our future funding requirements will depend on our ability to generate continued revenue from sales of NUZYRA, and our partners, Almirall and Zai’s, ability to generate continued revenue from sales of SEYSARA and NUZYRA, respectively, with respect to which we are entitled to tiered royalties in the U.S. and flat royalties in the greater China region. We do not expect to generate any other revenue unless and until our omadacycline greater China region partner, Zai, commercializes NUZYRA in the greater China region, and our SEYSARA greater China region partner, Almirall, obtains regulatory approval of and commercializes its respective product in the greater China region. Zai received approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China of NUZYRA for the treatment of CABP and ABSSSI in December 2021.
We will require substantial additional funding to meet FDA PMRs for NUZYRA, which we expect to continue to be funded through the BARDA contract. Additional resources will also be needed to support and accelerate the commercialization of NUZYRA, fund the development of omadacycline in other indications, including NTM, and to advance the development of potential other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. BARDA’s procurements of NUZYRA will also be an important component to satisfying future funding requirements.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenditures and operating losses for the next several years as we:
•
conduct additional clinical trials of omadacycline;
•
seek regulatory approvals for additional indications for omadacycline, such as omadacycline for the treatment of NTM;
•
continue to augment our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize NUZYRA and increase our manufacturing capacity and capabilities to satisfy demand;
•
add personnel to support our planned commercialization efforts;
•
build product inventory; and
•
service and pay down our debt.
Based upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $95.5 million as of December 31, 2021, will extend our cash runway through the end of 2023 with a pathway to cash flow break even.
We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our pharmaceutical products, especially given the constraints on in-person promotion of NUZYRA, reduced access to prescribers due to restrictions in access to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unknown extent to which we will maintain existing or enter into new collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our product and product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that we will require to fund our continuing operations, including for our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts for NUZYRA. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the progress of clinical development of omadacycline in additional indications, including NTM;
•
the costs and timing of commercialization activities for NUZYRA;
•
product revenue received from commercial sales of NUZYRA;
•
royalty revenue received from commercial sales of SEYSARA by Almirall;
•
timing and amount of actual reimbursements and NUZYRA purchases under the BARDA contract;
•
the ability of Zai to manufacture and commercialize NUZYRA in the Zai territory;
•
the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue;
•
the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of seeking, obtaining, maintaining and expanding FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals;
•
the costs associated with manufacturing and maintaining high quality sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;
•
the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue;
•
our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•
our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, commercial, operations and medical personnel;
•
the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products;
•
our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;
•
resources required to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations;
•
costs required to ensure that our and our partners’ business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations;
•
the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under such arrangements; and
•
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy generally and on our business and operations specifically, including our sales of NUZYRA, sales by our collaboration partners with respect to which we are entitled to royalties, our third-party manufacturers and supply chain, our research and development efforts, our clinical trials and our employees.
Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations, grant funding and government funding. We do not have any committed external sources of funds other than the rights under the BARDA contract and the rights to contingent milestone payments and/or royalties under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, the Almirall China License, the Tetraphase License Agreement and the Zai Collaboration Agreement, which are terminable by Almirall, Tetraphase and Zai, respectively, upon prior written notice. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholders’ rights. Future debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. Additionally, future equity or debt financing may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all, complicated by the increased volatility within the global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, NUZYRA, sarecycline, future revenue streams, research programs, product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market NUZYRA, sarecycline or our other product candidates that we may otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to, among other items, accounts receivable and related reserves, inventory and related reserves, accrued sales allowances, net product revenue, government contract service revenue, government contract grant revenue, SEYSARA royalty revenue, leases, stock-based compensation arrangements, manufacturing and clinical accruals, useful lives for depreciation and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist stockholders and investors reading the consolidated financial statements in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied as services are rendered.
We enter into collaboration agreements for research, development, manufacturing and commercial services that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which it licenses certain rights to its product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. The amount of variable consideration is constrained until it is probable that the revenue is not at a significant risk of reversal in a future period. The contracts into which we enter generally do not include significant financing components.
As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the transaction price under step (iii) above and (b) the timing of revenue recognition, including the appropriate measure of progress, in step (v) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price, as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.
Amounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.
Licenses of intellectual property
In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise(s), whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise(s), whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise(s), and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise(s). For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Customer options
If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent or include a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.
Milestone payments
At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
Royalties
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all the royalty has been allocated is satisfied (or partially satisfied).
Contract costs
We recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the costs are expected to be recovered. As a practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. To date, we have not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.
The Company sells its product principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell the Company’s product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, the Company enters into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product.
Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which typically occurs once the Company has transferred physical possession of the good to the customer. The transaction price that the Company recognizes as revenue reflects the amount it expects to be entitled to in connection with the sale and transfer of control of product to its customers. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the time that the Company’s customers take control of the product, which is when the Company’s performance obligation under the sales contracts is complete, the Company records product revenues net of applicable reserves for various types of variable consideration based on the Company’s estimates of channel mix. The types of variable consideration in our product revenue are as follows:
•
Trade discounts and allowances
•
Product returns
•
Chargebacks and rebates
•
Government rebates
•
Commercial payer and other rebates
•
Voluntary patient assistance programs
In determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals, the Company must make significant judgments and estimates. For example, in determining these amounts, the Company estimates prescription demand from the specialty pharmacies, hospital demand, buying patterns by hospitals, hospital systems and/or group purchasing organizations and the levels of inventory held by specialty distributors and customers. Making these determinations involves analyzing third-party industry data to determine whether trends in historical channel distribution patterns will predict future product sales. The Company receives data periodically from its specialty distributors and customers on inventory levels and historical channel sales mix, and the Company considers this data when determining the amount of the allowances and accruals for variable consideration.
The amount of variable consideration is estimated by using either of the following methods, depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled:
a)
The “expected value” is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. Under ASC 606, an expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the Company has many contracts with similar characteristics.
b)
The “most likely amount” is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (i.e., the single most likely outcome of the contract). Under ASC 606, the most likely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (i.e., either achieve or do not achieve a threshold specified in a contract).
The method selected is applied consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration. In addition, the Company considers all the information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The relevant factors used in this determination include, but are not limited to, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.
In assessing whether a constraint is necessary, the Company considers both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The specific considerations the Company uses in estimating these amounts related to variable consideration associated with the Company’s products are as follows:
Trade Discounts and Allowances - The Company generally provides customers with discounts that are explicitly stated in the Company’s contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, the Company receives sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from the Company’s sale of products to the customer, these payments are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive.
Product Returns - Generally, the Company’s customers have the right to return any unopened/unused product supply during the 18-month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending 12 months after the labeled expiration date. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time, the Company looks at industry data for comparable products in the market as well as its own historical purchasing, demand and return patterns of its customers when evaluating reserves for product returns. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time, it will place less reliance on industry data.
At the end of each reporting period for any of our products, the Company may decide to constrain revenue for product returns based on information from various sources, including channel inventory levels and dating and sell-through data, the expiration dates of product currently being shipped, price changes of competitive products and introductions of generic products.
Chargebacks - Although the Company primarily sells products to specialty distributors in the U.S., the Company also enters into agreements with hospitals and outpatient infusion centers, either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their members, in connection with the purchase of product. Based on these agreements, some of the Company’s customers have the right to receive a discounted price on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, the Company typically provides a credit to its specialty distributors customer (i.e., chargeback), representing the difference between the customer’s acquisition list price and the discounted price.
Government Rebates -The Company is subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. The Company estimates our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related product revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom it will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. The Company’s liability for these rebates consists of an estimate of claims for the current quarter and estimated future claims that will be made for product sales that have been recognized as revenue but remain in distribution channel inventory at period end.
Commercial Payer and Other Rebates - The Company plans to continue to contract with certain private payer organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of NUZYRA and contracted formulary status. The Company estimates these rebates and records reserves for such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized. These rebates result from performance-based goals, formulary position and price increase limit allowances (price protection). The calculation of the reserve for these rebates is based on an estimate of the coverage patterns and the resulting applicable rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period.
Patient Assistance - The Company offers certain voluntary patient assistance programs for prescriptions, such as co-pay assistance programs, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product sale that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution and pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company adjusts its allowances for cash discounts, product returns, chargebacks, and other rebates and discounts when the Company believes actual experience may differ from current estimates.
Revenue Earned Under Government Contracts
If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of its government contracts represent a transaction with a customer to obtain services or goods that are an output of its ordinary activities in exchange for consideration, it accounts for those aspects of the arrangement in accordance with ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Arrangements that are entirely in the scope of other guidance are accounted for under that guidance.
The Company recognizes sales of NUZYRA under its government contracts as product revenue when control of NUZYRA is transferred, in accordance with ASC 606. It also recognizes government contract service revenue and government contract grant revenue as defined below.
Government Contract Service Revenue
Government contract service revenue is recognized as services are performed. Revenue and related reimbursable expenses are presented on a gross basis in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.
Government Contract Grant Revenue
The allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized as the related reimbursable expenses are incurred. The cost reimbursements that are reported as revenue is presented gross of the related reimbursable expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. Prior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incurred expenses for the manufacture of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense. Inventory used in clinical trials is also expensed as research and development expense when selected for such use. We classify inventory costs as long-term when we expect to utilize the inventory beyond its normal operating cycle. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period and writes down any excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they
occur, are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires the use of estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.
Recent Accounting Standards
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. The FASB subsequently issued amendments to ASU 2016-13, which have the same effective date and transition date of January 1, 2023. These standards require that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, these standards now require allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. These standards limit the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. Based on the composition of our investment portfolio, accounts receivable and other financial assets, current market conditions and historical credit loss activity, we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss and related disclosures.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Leases
We lease our Boston, Massachusetts and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania office spaces under non-cancelable operating leases expiring in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
We executed an amendment to the existing lease agreement on its Boston office space in April 2021. The amended lease agreement released 8,104 rentable square feet of office space and extends the lease term for the remaining 4,153 rentable square feet of office space through August 2023 for an additional commitment of $0.4 million. In accordance with the amendment, we were refunded the insignificant security deposit paid in July 2016.
We executed an amended lease agreement on our King of Prussia office space in October 2016. The amended lease agreement is for 19,708 rentable square feet of office space and we took control of such office space during the first quarter of 2017. The total lease commitment is over a seven-year and seven-month lease term. The amended lease agreement contains rent escalation and a partial rent abatement period, which is accounted for as rent expense under the straight-line method. We are required to make additional payments under the facility operating leases for taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period.
Licenses
In February 1997, we and Tufts University, or Tufts, entered into a license agreement under which we acquired an exclusive license to certain patent applications and other intellectual property of Tufts related to the drug resistance field to develop and commercialize products for the treatment or prevention of bacterial or microbial diseases or medical conditions in humans or animals or for agriculture. We subsequently entered into eleven amendments to that agreement, collectively the Tufts License Agreement, to include patent applications filed after the effective date of the original license agreement, to exclusively license additional technology from Tufts, to expand the field of the agreement to include disinfectant applications, and to change the royalty rate and percentage of sublicense income paid by us to Tufts under sublicense agreements with specified sublicensees.
In September 2009, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, entered into a Collaborative Development, Manufacture and Commercialization License Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, which provided Novartis with a global, exclusive patent and technology license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of omadacycline. The Novartis Agreement was terminated by Novartis without cause in June 2011 and the termination was effective 60 days later. We and Novartis subsequently entered in a letter agreement in January 2012, or the Novartis Letter Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we reconciled shared development costs and expenses and granted Novartis a right of first negotiation with respect to commercialization rights of omadacycline following approval of omadacycline from the FDA, EMA, or any regulatory agency, but only to the extent we have not previously granted such commercialization rights related to omadacycline to another third party as of any such approval.
Long-Term Debt
As of December 31, 2021, we had recorded long-term debt obligations of $254.4 million, net of debt discount and issuance costs of $5.7 million. Debt issuance costs are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than capitalized as an asset in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
R-Bridge Loan Agreement
On December 31, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary PRTK SPV2 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty and revenue interest-backed loan agreement with an affiliate of R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., herein referred to as the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the Subsidiary borrowed a $60.0 million term loan, secured by, and repaid with proceeds from, (i) royalties from our license agreement with Zai (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or the Zai Collaboration Agreement, and such royalties, or the Royalty Interest, and (ii) a revenue interest based on our U.S. sales of NUZYRA in an initial amount of two and a half percent (2.5%), which amount may adjust under certain circumstances up to five percent (5%), of our net U.S. sales, subject to an annual cap of $10.0 million, which may adjust under certain circumstances to $12.0 million, or the Revenue Interest.
Under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 7.0%, increasing to an annual rate of 10% during the continuance of any event of default. Payments of the obligations outstanding under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement are made quarterly out of the Royalty Interest payments and Revenue Interest payments received by the Subsidiary during such quarter, or the Collection Amount. On each payment date, after payment of certain expenses, the Collection Amount shall be applied first to accrued interest, with any excess up to $15.0 million per annum applied to repay principal until the balance is fully repaid, and any shortfalls being capitalized are added to the principal balance of the loan. Amounts in excess of the $15.0 million annual cap shall be shared between us and R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., or the R-Bridge Lender, based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Following repayment in full of the loan, the first $15.0 million per annum in Collection Amount shall be paid to us and any amounts in excess shall be shared between us and the R-Bridge Lender based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.
Prior to the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the R-Bridge Loan Agreement will automatically terminate once the Subsidiary has paid to the R-Bridge Lender, in the form of regularly scheduled payments or as a voluntary prepayment, a capped amount of $114 million, less principal, interest and certain fee payments through the date of such prepayment, or the Capped Amount. After the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Revenue Interest can be terminated but the Royalty Interest payments shall continue until maturity of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement on December 31, 2032, at which time, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, if any, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash by the Subsidiary.
Our subsidiary, PRTK SPV1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and owner of the Subsidiary’s capital stock, has entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of the R-Bridge Lender, pursuant to which the Subsidiary’s obligations under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement are secured by PRTK SPV1 LLC’s pledge of all of the Subsidiary’s capital stock.
The R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds; maintenance of books and records; financial reporting and notification; compliance with laws; and protection of Company intellectual property. The R-Bridge Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions; issuing dividends and distributions; incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business; engaging in any business activity other than related to the Zai Collaboration Agreement; and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to the R-Bridge Lender under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.
An ancillary agreement executed by us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Revenue Interest, contains negative covenants applicable to us, including restrictions on the sale or transfer of our assets related to NUZYRA and giving rise to the Revenue Interest, each subject to the exceptions set forth therein.
The R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal, unpaid interest and other obligations of the Subsidiary, shall be immediately due and payable by the Subsidiary. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due; failure to pay the Capped Amount when due following a non-qualified change of control, any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant; any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants; any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under an ancillary agreement executed by the us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Royalty Interest; any termination of the Zai Collaboration Agreement; and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. No events of default had occurred under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement through December 31, 2021.
The net proceeds of the term loan were used by the Subsidiary to purchase from the Company the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest, pursuant to the terms of the Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement and the Contribution and Servicing Agreement, respectively. We raised approximately $58.3 million in net proceeds in connection with the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, comprised of the $60.0 million term loan funded at execution, net of $1.1 million in lender fees accounted for as debt discount and $0.6 million in direct and incremental third-party expenses accounted for as debt issuance costs. The net proceeds of the term loan, together with cash on hand, was used to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the loan arrangement with Hercules Capital, Inc.
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
On April 18, 2018, we entered into a Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with several initial purchasers, or the Initial Purchasers, for whom Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Leerink Partners LLC acted as representatives, relating to the sale of $135.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, or the Notes, to the Initial Purchasers. We also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on April 20, 2018.
The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities.
In addition, J. Wood Capital Advisors LLC, our financial advisor, purchased $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in a separate, concurrent private placement on the same terms as other investors.
The Notes were issued by us on April 23, 2018, pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of such date, or the Indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the Trustee. The Notes bear cash interest at the annual rate of 4.75%, payable on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018, and mature on May 1, 2024 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. We will settle conversions of the Notes through delivery of shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 62.8931 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.90 per share, representing a conversion premium of approximately 20% above the closing price of the common stock of $13.25 per share on April 18, 2018.
Holders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date.
We may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes, at its option, on or after May 6, 2021 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If we experience a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will, subject to specified conditions, have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Notes and following a notice of redemption of the Notes, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event or redemption.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default with respect to the Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default with respect to the Notes under the Indenture occurs or is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be immediately due and payable.
After deducting costs incurred of $6.0 million, we raised net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $159.0 million in April 2018. All costs were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the Notes at an effective interest rate of 5.47% and recorded as additional interest expense.
Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement
On February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty-backed loan agreement, or the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCRP. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, the Subsidiary borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.
Under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 12.0%. Payments of interest under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are made quarterly out of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement royalty payments received since the immediately preceding payment date. On each interest payment date, any royalty payments in excess of accrued interest on the loan will be used to repay the principal of the loan until the balance is fully repaid. In addition, the Subsidiary made up-front payments to HCRP of (i) a 1.5% fee and (ii) up to $300,000 for HCRP’s expenses. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement matures on May 1, 2029, at which time, if not earlier repaid in full, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash. We entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of HCRP, pursuant to which the Subsidiary’s obligations under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all of our holdings of the Subsidiary’s capital stock.
The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds; maintenance of books and records; financial reporting and notification; compliance with laws; and protection of our intellectual property. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions; issuing dividends and distributions; incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business; engaging in any business activity other than related to the Almirall Collaboration Agreement; and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to HCRP under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.
The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal and unpaid interest shall be immediately due and payable. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due; any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant; any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants; any uncured cross default under a material contract; any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under its Contribution and Servicing Agreement with the Subsidiary; any termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement; and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events.
Contract Service Providers
In the course of normal business operations, we also have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing and other activities for operating purposes which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days’ prior written notice. These payments are not included in this table of contractual obligations.
We could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, supplier and contractor agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and/or long-term commitments of cash.
Commercial Supply Agreements
We have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for further details on our agreements.
