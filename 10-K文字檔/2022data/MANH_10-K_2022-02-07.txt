Business Overview
We develop, sell, deploy, service and maintain software solutions designed to manage Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain, inventory and omnichannel operations for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, logistics providers and other organizations. Our customers include many of the world’s most premier and profitable brands.
Our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex commerce enablement software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chains, and retail store operations including point of sale effectiveness and efficiency for our customers.
We have five principal sources of revenue:
●
cloud subscriptions, including software as a service (SaaS) and hosting of software;
●
licenses of our software;
●
customer support services and software enhancements (collectively, “maintenance”);
●
professional services, including solutions planning and implementation, related consulting, customer training, and reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses (collectively, “services”); and
●
hardware sales.
In 2021, we generated $663.6 million in total revenue, with a revenue mix of: cloud subscriptions 18%; software license 6%; maintenance 22%; services revenue 50%; and hardware 4%.
We have three geographic reportable segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale. Our international revenue was approximately $196.4 million, $178.1 million and $189.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represents approximately 30%, 30% and 31% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. International revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the United States. At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,600 employees worldwide. We have offices in Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia.
Future Expectations
Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain cautious about the global recovery, which we expect to be protracted. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our results for the full year ended 2021 exceeded our expectations due to solid demand for our cloud solutions. Our solutions are mission critical, supporting complex global supply chains. Favorable secular tailwinds, such as the digital transformation of businesses in manufacturing, wholesale and retail, coupled with our commitment to investing in organic innovation to deliver leading cloud supply chain, inventory and omnichannel commerce solutions is in synergistic alignment with current market demand. This alignment is contributing to our strong financial results, higher demand and strong win rates for our solutions for the period.
We remain committed to investing in our business to drive customer success and expand our total addressable market, which we believe will position us well to achieve long-term sustainable growth and earnings. We have taken steps to best ensure the health and safety of our employees globally. Our daily execution has evolved into hybrid model, and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with employees, customers and prospects, ensuring that they are supported as they navigate their way through this period.
Going forward, we are investing in our cloud business, including enterprise investments in innovation, and strategic operating expenses to support growth objectives. The pace at which the market adopts our cloud subscriptions, resulting in revenue recognition spread out over the subscription period rather than up front, combined with extended lead times for developing new business, can cause uncertainty, impacting our ability to accurately forecast bookings and revenues from quarter to quarter and over the longer term.
For 2022, our five strategic goals continue to be:
•Focus on customer success and drive sustainable long-term growth;
•Invest in innovation to expand our products and total addressable market;
•Expand our cloud suites of Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions;
•Develop and grow our cloud business and cloud subscription revenue; and
•Expand our global sales, marketing, and professional service teams.
Cloud Subscription
In 2017, we released Manhattan Active™ Solutions, accelerating our business transition to cloud subscriptions. Under a cloud subscription, customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software within a cloud environment that we provide and manage over a specified period of time. As part of our subscription program, we allow our existing customers to convert their maintenance contracts to cloud subscription contracts. Some customers have converted their maintenance contracts to cloud subscriptions, and we expect there will be continued opportunities to convert existing maintenance contracts to cloud subscription contracts in the future.
In the fourth year of our cloud transition, demand for our cloud solutions is the dominant preference of customers. Our perpetual license solutions are rapidly attritting due to market demand for cloud with 95% of our pipeline representing cloud. Cloud solutions are our fastest growing revenue line and represents 77% of total software revenue in 2021. We believe the reduction in license and maintenance revenue in favor of our cloud offerings is positive for our customers and Manhattan Associates.
Global Economic Trends and Industry Factors
Global macro-economic trends, technology spending, and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business. In 2021, approximately 70% of our total revenue was generated in the United States, 17% in EMEA, and the remaining balance in APAC, Canada, and Latin America. In addition, Gartner Inc. (“Gartner”), an information technology research and advisory company, estimates that nearly 75% of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in North America and Western Europe; consequently, the health of the U.S. and the Western European economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results.
We sell technology-based solutions with total pricing, including software and services, in many cases exceeding $1.0 million. Our software is often a part of our customers’ and prospects’ much larger capital commitment associated with facilities expansion and business improvement. We believe that, given the mission critical nature of our software, combined with a challenging global macro environment, our current sales cycles for large cloud subscriptions in our target markets could be extended. While demand for our
solutions is solid, the current business climate within the United States and geographic regions in which we operate may affect customers’ and prospects’ decisions regarding timing of strategic capital expenditures.
In January 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided a World Economic Outlook (WEO) update. The WEO update noted, “global growth is expected to moderate from 5.9 in 2021 to 4.4 percent in 2022. Global growth is expected to slow to 3.8 percent in 2023. The forecast is conditional on adverse health outcomes declining to low levels in most countries by end-2022, assuming vaccination rates improve worldwide and therapies become more effective.”
The WEO update projected that advanced economies, which represent our primary revenue markets, would grow at about 3.9 and 2.6 percent in 2022 and 2023, while the emerging and developing economies would grow at about 4.8 percent in 2022 and 4.7 percent in 2023.
While we are encouraged by our results, we remain cautious regarding the pace of global economic growth. We believe global geopolitical and economic volatility associated with the pandemic likely will continue to shape customers’ and prospects’ enterprise software buying decisions.
Revenue
Cloud Subscriptions and Software License revenue: Cloud subscriptions revenue and remaining performance obligation (“RPO”) growth are the leading indicators of our business performance, primarily derived from cloud subscription fees that customers pay for our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions. Since we announced our transition to becoming a cloud-first company in 2017 with our launch of Manhattan ActiveTM Solutions, we have continued to see a significant shift in demand for cloud solutions versus software license. By comparison, in 2016, cloud subscriptions and software license revenue represented 7% and 93%, respectively, of our total cloud and software license revenue mix.
In the full year ended 2021, cloud subscriptions and software license revenue were 77% and 23%, respectively, of our total cloud subscriptions and software license revenue mix. RPO increased 126% over prior year on strong demand. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $699.2 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from RPO for cloud subscriptions, maintenance contracts, and application managed services with a non-cancelable term greater than 1 year (including deferred revenue as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods). Going forward, we expect cloud revenue to increase as a percentage of total software revenue mix on solid market demand supplanting legacy perpetual license demand.
In 2021, cloud subscriptions revenue totaled $122.2 million, or 18% of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments recognized $103.9 million, $15.4 million and $2.9 million in cloud subscriptions revenue, respectively, in 2021. Cloud subscriptions revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically five years or more. Cloud subscription revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. These revenues generally have long sales cycles.
In 2021, license revenue totaled $37.1 million, or 6% of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments totaled $29.3 million, $5.7 million, and $2.1 million in license revenue, respectively, in 2021. The percentage mix of new to existing customers for the combination of cloud subscriptions and software license sales was approximately 20/80 in 2021.
Our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions are focused on core omnichannel operation (e-commerce, retail store operations and point of sale), supply chain commerce operations (Warehouse Management, Transportation Management and Labor Management), and Inventory Optimization, which are intensely competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change. We are a market leader in the supply chain management and omnichannel software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as ARC Advisory Group and Gartner. Our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our cloud subscriptions and software license revenues faster than our competitors through investment in innovation.
Maintenance Revenue: Our maintenance revenue totaled $145.8 million, or 22% of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA and APAC segments recognized $113.1 million, $23.1 million, and $9.6 million, respectively, in maintenance revenue in 2021. For maintenance, we offer a comprehensive 24 hours per day, 365 days per year program that provides our customers with software upgrades, when and if available, which include additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. The growth of maintenance revenues is influenced by: (1) new software license revenue growth; (2) annual renewal of support contracts; (3) increase in customers through acquisitions; (4) fluctuations in currency rates, and (5) conversion of maintenance contracts to cloud subscription contracts. Substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts. Maintenance revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. Maintenance renewal revenue is recognized over the renewal period once we have a contract upon payment from the customer.
Services Revenue: In 2021, our services revenue totaled $334.8 million, or 50% of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments recognized $256.4 million, $66.1 million, and $12.3 million, respectively.
Our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions. To ensure a successful product implementation, consultants assist customers with the initial installation of a system, the conversion and transfer of the customer’s historical data onto our system, and ongoing training, education, and system upgrades. We believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly, ensure the customer’s success with our solutions, strengthen our customer relationships, and add to our industry-specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations.
Although our professional services are optional, the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for their planning, implementation, or related needs. Professional services are typically rendered under time and materials-based contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis. Professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed-fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones.
Services revenue growth is contingent upon cloud sales and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. In addition, our professional services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies.
Hardware Revenue: Our hardware revenue, which we recognize net of related costs, totaled $23.7 million in 2021 representing 4% of total revenue. In conjunction with the licensing of our software, and as a convenience for our customers, we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties. These products include computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals. We resell all third-party hardware products and related maintenance pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor-authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products and services at discount prices. We generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a result, we do not maintain hardware inventory.
Product Development
We continue to invest significantly in research and development (R&D) to provide leading Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions to enable global retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and logistics providers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains, retail store operations and point of sale. Our R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $97.6 million, $84.3 million, and $87.6 million, respectively.
We expect to continue to focus our R&D resources on the development and enhancement of our core supply chain, inventory optimization, omnichannel and point of sale software solutions. We offer what we believe to be the broadest solutions portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace, to address all aspects of inventory optimization, transportation management, distribution management, planning, and omnichannel operations including order management, store inventory & fulfillment, call center and point of sale.
We also plan to continue to enhance our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs. We identify opportunities to further enhance our solutions and to develop and provide new solutions through our customer support organization, as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations, interactions with our user groups, association with leading industry analysts and market research firms, and participation in industry standards and research committees. Our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets, including retail, consumer goods, food and grocery logistics service providers, industrial and wholesale, high technology and electronics, life sciences, and government.
Cash Flow and Financial Condition
For 2021, we generated cash flow from operating activities of $185.2 million and have generated a cumulative total of $473.0 million for the three years ended December 31, 2021. Our cash at December 31, 2021 totaled $263.7 million, with no debt on our balance sheet. We currently have no credit facilities. During the past three years, our primary uses of cash have been for funding investments in R&D in our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions to drive revenue and earnings growth. In addition, we repurchased approximately $100.0 million of Manhattan Associates’ outstanding common stock under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved raising the Company’s remaining share repurchase authority to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our common stock.
In 2022, our priorities for use of cash will continue to be investments in our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions. We also will prioritize capital allocation in our global teams to fund growth, and accretive share repurchases. We do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in 2022 for general corporate purposes.

Results of Operations
In the following table, we present a selection of certain Statement of Income data for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
We have three geographic reportable segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Geographic revenue information is based on the location of sale. The revenues represented below are from external customers only. The geography-based expenses include costs of personnel, direct sales, marketing expenses, and general and administrative costs to support the business. There are certain corporate expenses included in the Americas segment that we do not charge to the other segments including research and development, certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization, and the amortization of acquired developed technology.

Hardware Revenue
Hardware revenue, net increased $6.8 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Hardware revenue, net increased $4.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The majority of hardware sales are derived from our Americas segment. Sales of hardware are largely dependent upon customer-specific desires, which fluctuate.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of Software License
Cost of software license consists of the costs associated with software reproduction; media, packaging and delivery; documentation, and other related costs; and royalties on third-party software sold with or as part of our products. In 2021, cost of license decreased by $0.6 million, compared to 2020. In 2020, cost of software license increased by $0.3 million compared to 2019.
Cost of Cloud Subscriptions, Maintenance and Services
Year 2021 compared with year 2020
Cost of cloud subscriptions, maintenance and services consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of employees dedicated to cloud subscriptions; maintenance services; and professional and technical services as well as hosting fees. The $28.5 million increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was principally due to a $17.0 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, and a $15.1 million increase in performance-based compensation expense, offset by a $2.0 million decrease in computer infrastructure costs and a $1.8 million decrease in travel expense.
Year 2020 compared with year 2019
The $15.3 million decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was principally due to a $18.7 million decrease in travel expense, a $7.4 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense and a $0.7 million decrease in facilities expense, offset by a $6.1 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expense, and a $7.0 million increase in computer infrastructure costs related to cloud business transition.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Our principal research and development (R&D) activities during 2021, 2020 and 2019 focused on the expansion and integration of new products and releases, including cloud solutions, while expanding the product footprint of our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions, including Inventory Optimization and point-of-sale.
For 2021, 2020 and 2019, we did not capitalize any R&D costs because the costs incurred following the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant.
Year 2021 compared with year 2020
R&D expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel-related costs for personnel involved in our research and development activities. Research and development expenses in 2021 increased by $13.4 million compared to 2020. This increase is principally due to a $7.8 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, and a $4.4 million increase in performance-based compensation expense.
Year 2020 compared with year 2019
Research and development expenses in 2020 decreased by $3.3 million compared to 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense, and $1.1 million decrease in travel related expense.
Sales and Marketing
Year 2021 compared with year 2020
Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, commissions, travel and other personnel-related costs and the costs of our marketing and alliance programs and related activities. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a $6.2 million increase in performance-based compensation expense, a $2.5 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, and a $1.6 million increase in marketing and campaign programs.
Year 2020 compared with year 2019
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $9.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a $3.1 million decrease in marketing and campaign programs, a $2.7 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense, and a $2.6 million decrease in travel expenses.
General and Administrative
Year 2021 compared with year 2020
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs of executive, financial, human resources, information technology, and administrative personnel, as well as facilities, legal, insurance, accounting, and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $6.6 million in 2021 primarily due to a $4.0 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, and a $2.5 million increase in performance-based compensation expenses.
Year 2020 compared with year 2019
General and administrative expenses decreased $3.2 million in 2020 primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense, a $0.5 million decrease in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, and a $0.5 million decrease in corporate event-related expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization of intangibles and software expense amounted to $7.9 million, $8.9 million, and $8.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization of intangibles was immaterial in 2021, 2020 and 2019. We have recorded goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets as part of the purchase accounting associated with various acquisitions.
Operating Income
Operating income in 2021 increased $20.2 million to $134.3 million, compared to $114.1 million for 2020. Operating margins were 20.2% for 2021 versus 19.5% for 2020. Operating income and operating margin increased primarily due to increased cloud subscriptions and services revenues. In 2021, operating income increased in both of the Americas and EMEA segments by $10.1 million, while the APAC segment remained relatively flat.
Operating income in 2020 decreased $1.8 million to $114.1 million, compared to $115.9 million for 2019. Operating margins were 19.5% for 2020 versus 18.8% for 2019. Operating income and margin decreased due to lower services revenue as we noticed some delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, operating income in the Americas segment increased by $2.5 million, and decreased in the EMEA and APAC segments by $2.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Other Income and Income Taxes
Other (Loss) Income, net
Other (loss) income, net primarily includes interest income, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-operating expenses. Interest income was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.7 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate earned on cash and investments was immaterial for 2021, 2020 and 2019. We recorded net foreign currency losses of $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $1.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The foreign currency gains and losses mainly resulted from gains or losses on intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies with subsidiaries due to the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Indian Rupee.
Income Tax Provision
Our effective income tax rates were 17.6%, 23.3%, and 26.1% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income, domestically by state and internationally by country, and available income tax credits.
The effective tax rate in 2021 decreased from 2020 is mainly due to an increase of excess tax benefits on restricted stock vesting, a decrease in expense for tax contingencies, and an increase in foreign jurisdiction business incentives. These benefits were partially offset by a net increase in non-deductible equity-based compensation.
The effective income tax rate in 2020 decreased from 2019 mainly due to an increase of excess tax benefits on restricted stock vesting and a decrease in expense for tax contingencies. These benefits were partially offset by a net increase in non-deductible equity-based compensation.
The income tax provision for 2021, 2020 and 2019 included excess tax benefits of $6.6 million, $3.8 million, and $0.2 million on vesting of restricted stock.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we funded our business through cash generated from operations. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 included $219.6 million held in the U.S. and $44.1 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our cash balances in the U.S. are sufficient to fund our U.S. operations. In the future, if we elect to repatriate the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, we would no longer be subject to additional U.S. income taxes on such earnings due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, but we could be subject to additional local withholding taxes.
Cash flow from operating activities totaled $185.2 million, $140.9 million, and $146.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Typical factors affecting our cash provided by operating activities include our level of revenue and earnings for the period, the timing and amount of employee bonus and income tax payments, and the timing of cash collections from our customers which is our primary source of operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for 2021 increased $44.3 million compared to 2020, which is mainly due to earnings growth in 2021, and the timing of cash collections, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments. Cash flow from operating activities for 2020 decreased $6.0 million compared to 2019, which is mainly due to an increase in employee bonus payments and the timing of cash collections, partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments. Days sales outstanding was 67, 68 and 61 at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting solid cash collections.
Investing activities used cash of approximately $4.0 million, $2.7 million, and $13.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our investing activities for 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of capital spending to support company growth and short-term investing. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, capital expenditure was $4.0 million, $2.7 million, and $15.2 million, respectively. Net investment proceeds in 2019 was $1.4 million.
Financing activities used cash of approximately $120.4 million, $43.6 million, and $121.5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The principal use of cash for financing activities in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was to purchase our common stock, including shares withheld for taxes due upon vesting of restricted stock. Repurchases of our common stock for 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $120.4 million, $43.6 million, and $121.5 million, respectively, including shares withheld for taxes of $20.4 million, $18.6 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. We suspended the share repurchase program, effective April 1, 2020, to position our Company for uncertainty in the near-term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Board of Directors reinstated the program in January 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved raising the Company’s remaining share repurchase authority to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
Periodically, opportunities may arise to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary products, and technologies. Any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount, timing, and nature of the consideration to be paid. We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least for the next twelve months, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. With the COVID-19 impact, we continue to focus on managing liquidity, while investing in and growing our headcount capacity to support our customers and grow our business. In 2022, we anticipate that our priorities for use of cash will be similar to prior years, with our first priority being continued investment in product development and in our business to extend our market leadership. We will evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction. We will also continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business. At this time, we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in 2022 for general corporate purposes.
Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments as of December 31, 2021 consist of multiple non-cancellable contracts for cloud infrastructure services and obligations under operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, our cloud infrastructure obligations are approximately $128.6 million over the next 5 years. We also enter into non-cancellable subscriptions in the ordinary course of business for internal software to support our operations. Our obligations, as of December 31, 2021, are approximately $13.5 million over the next 3 years. We expect to fulfill all of these commitments from our working capital.
Lease Commitments
We lease our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2029. Rent expense for these leases aggregated $7.9 million, $7.9 million, and $8.4 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the following table, we present a summary of our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
Indemnities
Our customer contracts generally contain infringement indemnity provisions. Under those provisions, we generally agree, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer in connection with third party claims against the customer alleging that the customer’s use of our software services and products infringe third party intellectual property rights. Conditions to our obligations generally include that we are provided the right to control the defense of the claims and, in general, to control settlement negotiations. Those provisions generally provide also that, if the customer is prevented from using our services or products because of a third party infringement claim, our sole obligation (in addition to the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation referred to above) is to, at our expense, (i) procure for the customer the right to continue to use the services or products, (ii) replace or modify the services or products so that the customer’s use does not infringe, or, if neither of those options is reasonably feasible, terminate that particular services or products and provide, as applicable, a refund of services fees paid for services not received or a refund of the unamortized portion of the license fees paid for the products (based on a five year amortization period). Our customer contracts sometimes also require us to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer in connection with death, personal injury or property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors. The indemnity obligations contained in our customer contracts generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on liability, but they do not cover indirect or consequential damages, such as our customers’ lost revenues or profits. We have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations. We account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with the FASB guidance on accounting for contingencies and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. We have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2021.
Warranties
In general, in our customer contracts for purchase of our cloud SaaS services or license of our on-premises software products, we warrant that our services or software will perform in accordance with our published services or product specifications. Additionally, we may include other warranties such as “no-malware” warranties and warranties that we will perform our SaaS services consistent with generally accepted industry standards or similar standards. In our SaaS services agreements, we also include service level agreements (SLAs) under which we agree to provide service credits to our customers if our services availability drops below certain defined levels. If necessary, we would reserve for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claims history. However, we have not incurred significant recurring expense under our services or product warranties. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of our warranty obligations is nominal and we have no liabilities recorded for them as of December 31, 2021.
New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal Year 2021
Income Taxes
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating taxes during the quarters and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and changes in tax laws or rates, as well as clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. On January 1, 2021, we adopted this guidance, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The SEC defines “critical accounting policies” as those that require application of management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based on information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. To the extent there are material differences between those estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions are: Revenue Recognition and Accounting for Income Taxes.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the promised products or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. We derive our revenue from cloud subscriptions, software licenses, customer support services and software enhancements (“maintenance”), implementation and training services, and sales of hardware. We exclude sales and usage-based taxes from revenue.
Nature of Products and Services
Cloud subscriptions includes software as a service and arrangements which provide customers with the right to use our software within a cloud environment that we provide and manage where the customer does not have the right to take possession of the software without significant penalty. SaaS and hosting revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period. For contracts that include a perpetual license and hosting services, we generally consider the arrangement as an overall service, recognized over the initial hosting term. The software license fee typically due at the outset of the arrangement is not payable again if the customer renews the hosting services, so that the customer’s option to renew the hosting services is a material right, the revenue from which, if the option is exercised, we will recognize over the applicable renewal period.
Our perpetual software licenses provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and we have made the software available to the customer. Our perpetual software licenses are typically sold with maintenance under which we provide a comprehensive 24 hours per day, 365 days per year program that provides customers with software upgrades, when and if available, which include additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months.
Our services revenue consists of fees generated from implementation, training and application managed services, including reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses in connection with our implementation services. Implementation services include system planning, design, configuration, testing, and other software implementation support, and are typically optional and distinct from our software. Following implementation, customers may purchase application managed services to support and maintain our software. Fees for our services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. In certain situations, we render professional services under agreements based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement. Revenue related to fixed-fee-based services contracts is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.
Significant Judgements
Our customer contracts include the sale of multiple SaaS services or licensed products. Judgement is required to determine whether each service or product sold is a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). We estimate SSP based on the prices we charge our customers or by using other information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling price of our software licenses is highly variable. Thus, we estimate SSP for software licenses using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other goods and services promised in the contract.
Contract Balances
Timing of invoicing to customers may differ from timing of revenue recognition. Payment terms for our software licenses vary. We have an established history of collecting under the terms of our software license contracts without providing refunds or concessions to our customers. Cloud subscriptions and maintenance are typically billed annually in advance. We typically bill our professional services monthly as performed. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with predictable ways to purchase our software and services, not to provide or receive financing. Additionally, we are applying the practical expedient to exclude from consideration any contracts with payment terms of one year or less as we rarely offer terms extending beyond one year.
Deferred revenue mainly represents amounts collected prior to having completed performance of maintenance, cloud subscriptions and professional services.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC. Under this accounting pronouncement, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for
financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return. Management must make significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.
Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, allowable deductions, projected tax credits, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our statement of financial position and our statements of income. Our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
