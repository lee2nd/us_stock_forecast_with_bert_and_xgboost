Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with the historical audited annual consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the Company corrected the 2020 consolidated financial statements to account for Sponsor Warrants as a liability on the Company’s balance sheet with subsequent changes in their value recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations at each reporting date. These corrections are reflected in the discussions. See “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1. Description of Business and Accounting Policies” for additional information.
This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Opendoor’s mission is to empower everyone with the freedom to move and make it possible to buy, sell and move at the tap of a button. We are transforming what has historically been a complex, uncertain, time-consuming and mostly offline process into a simple, online experience. Since our inception in 2014, we have built scalable pricing capabilities, technology-enabled centralized operations, and a suite of digital-first consumer products. These investments have enabled us to help customers buy or sell homes in over 140,000 transactions and expand our footprint to 44 markets across the country. Most importantly, we have grown rapidly while delighting our customers with an experience that brings simplicity, certainty and speed to the home selling and buying process.
Financial Highlights
Business Impact of COVID-19
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent health risks, we substantially paused purchasing additional homes in March 2020 to safeguard the health and safety of our customers and employees. In addition to pausing new acquisitions, we sold down most of our homes in inventory at a healthy pace, leading to a low point in inventory of $152 million as of September 30, 2020 compared to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. As our revenues are dependent on inventory levels available for sale, we experienced sequential, quarter-over-quarter declines in revenue in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. After retooling certain operational processes to enable “contactless” transactions, we resumed making

offers to purchase homes in select markets in May 2020 and resumed operations across all of our markets by the end of August 2020. We surpassed pre-COVID-19 inventory levels in the second quarter of 2021 and ended the year with inventory of $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. While we believe we have adapted our operations to function effectively during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our business remains sensitive to potential future disruptions of the real estate market caused by COVID-19 and its variants.
Factors Affecting our Business Performance
Market Penetration in Existing Markets
Residential real estate is one of the largest consumer markets, with approximately $2.3 trillion of home value transacted annually. Given we operate in a highly fragmented industry and offer a differentiated value proposition to the incumbent agent-led transaction, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our share in our existing cities. By providing a consistent, high-quality and differentiated experience to our customers, we hope to continue to drive positive word-of-mouth awareness and trust in our platform. We believe this creates a virtuous cycle, whereby more home sellers will request an offer from Opendoor, allowing us to deepen our market penetration.
Expansion into New Markets
We have expanded into 44 markets as of December 31, 2021. The following table represents the number of markets as of the periods presented:
We launched 23 new markets in 2021, exceeding our goal to double the markets we serve over the course of 2021. We have honed our market launch playbook by centralizing many of our core pricing, operations, and customer service functions, enabling us to launch new markets more efficiently and quickly in the future. For example, we are generally able to launch a market with only a small field team focused on home renovation oversight, with all other key functions managed centrally.
We view the first year of a market launch as an investment period during which we refine our pricing models, renovation strategies and cost structure. Historically, we have seen underwriting performance for purchase cohorts in new markets improve approximately one year after initial launch. While new markets do not contribute significantly to revenue during their first year of operation, they provide a foundation for long-term growth once local operational and pricing capabilities have been refined.
We made substantial investments to support our market launches in 2021, which we expect will impact both Contribution Margin and Adjusted EBITDA as these new markets mature. We expect such investments to continue as we launch additional markets.
Adjacent Services
We believe home sellers and buyers value simplicity and convenience. To that end, we are building an online, integrated suite of home services, which currently include title insurance and escrow services, Buy with Opendoor, Opendoor Home Loans, and Opendoor Complete. We believe that vertically integrating services that are adjacent to the core real estate transaction will allow us to deliver a superior, seamless experience to the consumer. Our success with title insurance and escrow services helps validate our view that customers prefer an online, integrated experience. We expect that these adjacent services will also be accretive to our Contribution Margin.
We will continue to evaluate new ways to improve our end-to-end solution and expect to invest in additional adjacent products and services over time.

Unit Economics
We view Contribution Margin and Contribution Margin after Interest as key measures of unit economic performance. Our long-term financial performance depends, in part, on continuing to expand unit margins through the following initiatives:
•Successful incremental attach of services that supplement the core transaction margin profile via our existing services as well as new ones.
•Pricing engine optimization and enhancements, as we expand our reach in existing markets and enter new markets.
•Lowering platform costs through process refinement, greater automation and self-service, and more efficient forms of financing.
Inventory Management
Effectively managing our overall inventory position is critical to our financial performance. Since our inception, we have prioritized investment in our pricing capabilities across our home acquisition processes and our forecasting and resale systems, and will continue to do so. As part of our overall risk management framework, we consider both individual market and aggregate portfolio exposures. We typically seek to maximize the resale margin performance of our inventory while balancing sell-through rates, holding periods, and portfolio aging. Similarly, we evaluate our portfolio health metrics relative to the broader market (as observed on the MLS) as another key indicator of inventory management performance. One such metric is our percentage of homes “on the market” for greater than 120 days (as measured from initial listing date). As of December 31, 2021, such homes represented 8% of our portfolio, compared to 24% for the broader market when filtered for the types of homes we are able to underwrite and acquire in a given market based on characteristics such as price range, home type, home location, year built and lot size (defined as our “Buybox".)
Inventory Financing
Our business model is working capital intensive and inventory financing is a key enabler of our growth. We primarily rely on our access to non-recourse asset-backed debt, which consist of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities, to finance our home acquisitions. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt and Financing Arrangements.”
Seasonality
The residential real estate market is seasonal, with greater demand from home buyers in the spring and summer, and typically weaker demand in late fall and winter. We expect our financial results and working capital requirements to reflect seasonal variations over time, although our growth and market expansion have obscured the impact of seasonality in our historical financials and may continue to do so. That said, we generally expect stronger sequential revenue growth in the first quarter of the year versus the third and fourth quarters.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results of operations below, we report certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
These measures have limitations as analytical tools when assessing our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, including gross profit and net income. We may calculate or present our non-GAAP financial measures differently than other companies who report measures with similar titles and, as a result, the non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable with those of companies in our industry or in other industries.
Adjusted Gross Profit, Contribution Profit and Contribution Profit After Interest
To provide investors with additional information regarding our margins and return on inventory acquired, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit, Contribution Profit and Contribution Profit After Interest, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit, Contribution Profit and Contribution Profit After Interest are useful financial measures for investors as they are supplemental measures used by management in evaluating unit level economics and our
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios,or as noted)
operating performance in our key markets. Each of these measures is intended to present the economics related to homes sold during a given period. We do so by including revenue generated from homes sold (and adjacent services) in the period and only the expenses that are directly attributable to such home sales, even if such expenses were recognized in prior periods, and excluding expenses related to homes that remain in inventory as of the end of the period. Contribution Profit provides investors a measure to assess Opendoor’s ability to generate returns on homes sold during a reporting period after considering home purchase costs, renovation and repair costs, holding costs and selling costs. Contribution Profit After Interest further impacts gross profit by including senior interest costs attributable to homes sold during a reporting period. We believe these measures facilitate meaningful period over period comparisons and illustrate our ability to generate returns on assets sold after considering the costs directly related to the assets sold in a given period.
Adjusted Gross Profit, Contribution Profit and Contribution Profit After Interest are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have limitations as analytical tools. For example, these measures include costs that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, costs required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These measures also exclude the impact of certain restructuring costs that are required under GAAP. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is gross profit.
Adjusted Gross Profit / Margin
We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit under GAAP adjusted for (1) inventory valuation adjustment in the current period, (2) inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods, and (3) restructuring in cost of revenue. Restructuring in cost of revenue reflects the costs associated with the reduction in our workforce in 2020, a portion of which were related to personnel included in cost of revenue. Inventory valuation adjustment in the current period is calculated by adding back the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period on homes that remain in inventory at period end. Inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods is calculated by subtracting the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of revenue. See “-Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Real Estate Inventory” for detailed discussion of inventory valuation adjustment.
We view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures gross margin performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Adjusted Gross Profit helps management assess home pricing, service fees and renovation performance for a specific resale cohort.
Contribution Profit / Margin
We calculate Contribution Profit as Adjusted Gross Profit, minus certain costs incurred on homes sold during the current period including: (1) holding costs incurred in the current period, (2) holding costs incurred in prior periods, and (3) direct selling costs. The composition of our holding costs is described in the footnotes to the reconciliation table below. Contribution Margin is Contribution Profit as a percentage of revenue.
We view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures the unit level performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Contribution Profit helps management assess inflows and outflows directly associated with a specific resale cohort.
Contribution Profit / Margin After Interest
We define Contribution Profit After Interest as Contribution Profit, minus interest expense under our non-recourse asset-backed senior debt facilities incurred on the homes sold during the period. This may include interest expense recorded in periods prior to the period in which the sale occurred. Our asset-backed senior debt facilities are secured by our real estate inventory and cash. See “- Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt and Financing Arrangements.” In addition to our senior debt facilities, we use a mix of debt and equity capital to finance our inventory and that mix will vary over time. In addition, we expect to continue to evolve our cost of financing as we include other debt sources beyond mezzanine capital. As such, in order to allow more meaningful period over period comparisons that more accurately reflect our asset performance rather than our evolving financing choices, we do not include interest expense associated with our mezzanine term debt facilities in this calculation. Contribution Margin After Interest is Contribution Profit After Interest as a percentage of revenue.

We view this metric as an important measure of business performance. Contribution Profit After Interest helps management assess Contribution Margin performance, per above, when burdened with the cost of senior financing.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Gross Profit, Contribution Profit and Contribution Profit After Interest to our gross profit, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:
________________
(1)Inventory valuation adjustment includes adjustments to record real estate inventory at the lower of its carrying amount or its net realizable value. See “-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Real Estate Inventory.”
(2)Inventory valuation adjustment - Current Period is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period presented associated with homes that remain in inventory at period end.
(3)Inventory valuation adjustment - Prior Periods is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods associated with homes that sold in the period presented.
(4)Restructuring in cost of revenue consists mainly of severance and employee termination benefits that were recorded to cost of revenue due to a reduction in workforce in the second quarter of 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
(5)Represents selling costs incurred related to homes sold in the relevant period. This primarily includes broker commissions, external title and escrow-related fees and transfer taxes.

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA
We also present Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to assess our underlying financial performance. These measures are also commonly used by investors and analysts to compare the underlying performance of companies in our industry. We believe these measures provide investors with meaningful period over period comparisons of our underlying performance, adjusted for certain charges that are non-recurring, non-cash, not directly related to our revenue-generating operations or not aligned to related revenue.
Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have important limitations. For example, these measures exclude the impact of certain costs required to be recorded under GAAP. These measures also include inventory valuation adjustments that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, inventory valuation adjustments required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These measures could differ substantially from similarly titled measures presented by other companies in our industry or companies in other industries. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss.
Adjusted Net Loss
We calculate Adjusted Net Loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, equity securities fair value adjustment, derivative and warrant fair value adjustment, and intangibles amortization expense. It also excludes non-recurring payroll tax on initial RSU release, restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on lease termination, legal contingency accrual, and convertible note payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and issuance discount amortization. Adjusted Net Loss also aligns the timing of inventory valuation adjustments recorded under GAAP to the period in which the related revenue is recorded in order to improve the comparability of this measure to our non-GAAP financial measures of unit economics, as described above. Our calculation of Adjusted Net Loss does not currently include the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments because our taxes and such tax effects have not been material to date.
Adjusted EBITDA
We calculated Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization, property financing and other interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business.

The following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:
________________
(1)Represents the gains and losses on certain financial instruments, which are marked to fair value at the end of each period.
(2)Represents amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The acquired intangible assets have useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years and amortization is expected until the intangible assets are fully amortized.
(3)Inventory valuation adjustment includes adjustments to record real estate inventory at the lower of its carrying amount or its net realizable value. See “-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Real Estate Inventory.”
(4)Inventory valuation adjustment - Current Period is the inventory valuation adjustment charge recorded during the period presented associated with homes that remain in inventory at period end.
(5)Inventory valuation adjustment - Prior Periods is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods associated with homes that sold in the period presented.
(6)Restructuring costs consist mainly of employee termination benefits, relocation packages and retention bonuses as well as costs related to the exiting of certain non-cancelable leases. In 2020, these costs related mainly to a reduction in workforce implemented in April 2020 as well as our exercise of the early termination option related to our San Francisco headquarters. In 2019, these costs related mainly to the centralization of our administrative and selling functions, including the relocation of local teams to Phoenix.
(7)Includes non-cash payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and amortization of the discount on the convertible notes issued from July through November 2019 (the “2019 Convertible Notes”). We exclude convertible note PIK interest and amortization

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of homes that we previously acquired from homeowners. In addition, we generate revenue from additional services we provide to both home sellers and buyers, which consists primarily of title insurance and escrow services, Buy with Opendoor and Opendoor Home Loans.
Home sales revenue from selling residential real estate is recognized when title to and possession of the property has transferred to the buyer and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally the close of escrow. The amount of revenue recognized for each home sale is equal to the sale price of the home net of any concessions.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes the property purchase price, acquisition costs, direct costs to renovate or repair the home and inventory valuation adjustments. These costs are accumulated in real estate inventory during the property holding period and charged to cost of revenue under the specific identification method when the property is sold. Additionally, for our revenue other than home sales revenue, cost of revenue consists of any costs incurred in delivering the service, including associated headcount expenses such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation.
Operating Expenses
Sales, Marketing and Operations Expense
Sales, marketing and operations expense consists primarily of broker commissions (paid to the home buyers’ real estate agents and third-party listing agents, if applicable), resale closing costs, holding costs related to real estate inventory including utilities, property taxes and maintenance, and expenses associated with product marketing, promotions and brand-building. Sales, marketing and operations expense also includes any headcount expenses in support of sales, marketing, and real estate operations such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, human resources, legal and administrative personnel, third-party professional services fees and rent expense.
We incurred a significant increase in stock-based compensation in 2021 as a result of certain performance-based awards and historical RSUs satisfying their liquidity event vesting conditions. The increase in stock-based compensation impacts each line item within Operating expenses. See “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14. Share-based Awards” for additional information.
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios,or as noted)
Technology and Development Expense
Technology and development expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees in the design, development, testing, maintenance and operation of our mobile applications, websites, tools and applications that support our products. Technology and development expense also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs.
Derivative and Warrant Fair Value Adjustment
Derivative and warrant fair value adjustment consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses as a result of marking our warrants and embedded derivatives related to the 2019 Convertible Notes to fair value at the end of each reporting period and subsequent settlement through exercise of warrants and conversion of the 2019 Convertible Notes to equity.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt is the result of the Company’s early termination of one of its mezzanine term debt facilities and certain amounts paid to lender in excess of the book basis with respect to the facility.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest paid or payable and the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs. Interest expense varies period over period, primarily due to fluctuations in our inventory volumes and changes in LIBOR, which impact the interest incurred on our senior revolving credit facilities (see “- Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt and Financing Arrangements”).
We expect our overall interest expense to increase as inventory increases. Subject to market conditions and cost of capital trade-offs, we will evaluate opportunities to expand our sources of financing over time, which may allow us to diversify our mix of financing sources to include more cost effective financing relative to our higher cost mezzanine term debt facilities.
Other Income - Net
Other income-net consists primarily of change in fair value of and dividend income from our investment in equity securities as well as interest income from our investment in debt securities.
Income Tax Expense
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
The following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
N/M - Not meaningful.
Revenue
Revenue increased by $5.4 billion, or 211%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in 2021 compared to 2020, as well as higher revenue per home. We sold 21,725 homes during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 9,913 homes during the year ended December 31, 2020, representing an increase of 119%, while revenue per home sold increased 42% between periods. The higher sales volumes are a reflection of growing market share in existing markets and, to a lesser extent, our expansion into new markets. We successfully grew our inventory levels throughout 2021, allowing us to sell-through significantly more homes relative to 2020, when we had much lower inventory levels due to our temporary pause in home purchases at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “- Business Impact of COVID-19”. Average resale prices were positively impacted by price mix within markets, overall home price appreciation and Buybox expansion.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit
Cost of revenue increased by $4.9 billion, or 209%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and a 41% increase in cost of revenue per home as a result of inventory mix, home price appreciation and Buybox expansion.
Gross margin improved from 8.5% to 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. For the same periods, Adjusted Gross Margin improved from 8.2% to 9.6%. The gross margin increase was primarily due to a combination of higher resale prices relative to our net purchase price for homes, repair and renovation efficiencies, and the effectiveness of our inventory resale systems. Contribution Margin increased from 4.3% to 6.5% for the same periods, due largely to a higher Adjusted Gross Margin as well as improvements in direct selling and holding costs. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios,or as noted)
Operating Expenses
Sales, Marketing and Operations. Sales, marketing and operations increased by $349 million, or 179%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a $123 million increase in resale transaction costs and broker commissions, consistent with the 119% increase in the number of homes sold. In addition, advertising expense increased by $90 million as we increased marketing to drive acquisition volumes in both existing and new markets launched in 2021, relative to the limited marketing spend in 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19. Property holding costs increased by $71 million consistent with increased inventory levels. Personnel expenses, including salaries and benefits increased $28 million consistent with the increase in headcount.
General and Administrative. General and administrative increased by $467 million, or 305%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to $430 million of additional stock-based compensation from the commencement of expense recognition of certain performance awards following the consummation of the Business Combination in December 2020 as well as the expense recognition of certain RSUs upon the fulfillment of the liquidity event vesting condition satisfied by the February 2021 Offering. Personnel expenses, including salaries and benefits increased $22 million consistent with the increase in headcount.
Technology and Development. Technology and development increased by $76 million, or 131%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a $56 million increase in stock-based compensation reflecting both an increase in headcount as well as the recognition of stock-based compensation beginning in 2021 when the February 2021 Offering satisfied the liquidity event vesting condition of certain RSUs. Personnel expenses, including salaries and benefits increased $12 million consistent with the increase in headcount.
Derivative and Warrant Fair Value Adjustment
Derivative and warrant fair value adjustment increased by $4 million, or 50%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The adjustments recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were primarily attributable to gain of $34 million and $12 million, respectively, due to a decrease in the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants between the time of the Business Combination and the completion of their redemption in July 2021. The gains recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 were offset by a $23 million increase in the fair value of a derivative liability in extinguishment of the Company's 2019 Convertible Notes.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt decreased by $11 million, or 100%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $11 million in 2020 resulted from the Company’s early termination of one of its mezzanine term debt facilities. The Company did not have any meaningful losses on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by $75 million, or 110%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in the average outstanding balances of our asset-backed senior debt facilities and mezzanine term debt facilities, which is consistent with our increase in inventory over the same periods. The increase in interest expense from our asset backed credit facilities is partially offset by a $8 million decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 2019 Convertible Notes, which were converted into equity in September 2020.
Other Income - Net
Other income - net increased by $34 million, or 850%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to the $35 million fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities recorded in 2021 when a company in which we invested went public.

Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense increased by a nominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
N/M - Not meaningful.
Revenue
Revenue decreased by $2.2 billion, or 46%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, reflecting the decline in our inventory levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “- Business Impact of COVID-19”. We sold 9,913 homes during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 18,799 homes during the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 47%, while the average resale home price increased 2.2% between periods.
Cost of revenue decreased by $2.1 billion, or 47%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes.
Gross profit margins improved from 6.4% to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. For the same periods, adjusted Gross Margins improved from 6.3% to 8.2%. Gross margin improvement was primarily due to pricing improvements, home renovation efficiency, and margins associated with adjacent services. Contribution Margin increased from 1.9% to 4.3% for the same periods, due largely to higher Adjusted Gross Margins as well as improvements in direct selling and holding costs. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Operating Expenses
Sales, Marketing and Operations. Sales, marketing and operations decreased by $189 million, or 49%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $42 million decrease in advertising expense, as we largely suspended paid marketing spend in the second quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19 before gradually resuming spend in the second half of the year. In addition, property holding costs declined by

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios,or as noted)
$39 million due to lower inventory volumes. Resale broker commissions and resale transaction costs declined by $60 million and $15 million, respectively, due to lower resale volumes. Personnel expenses decreased by $27 million due to headcount reductions, as a result of the April 2020 workforce reduction.
General and Administrative. General and administrative increased by $39 million, or 34%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to $20 million of additional stock based compensation from the commencement of expense recognition of certain performance awards upon the consummation of the Business Combination in December 2020. In addition, the Company incurred $18 million of costs related to exiting certain non-cancelable leases with no future benefits to the Company.
Technology and Development. Technology and development increased by $7 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an $8 million increase in amortization of internally developed software.
Derivative and Warrant Fair Value Adjustment
Derivative and warrant fair value adjustment increased by $2 million, or 33% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The adjustments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily attributable to a gain of $34 million due to a decrease in the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants between the time of the Business Combination and December 31, 2020. The gains were offset by a $23 million increase in the fair value of a derivative liability in extinguishment of the Company's 2019 Convertible Notes.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt increased from $0 to $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $11 million resulted from the Company’s early termination of one of its mezzanine term debt facilities in December 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $42 million, or 38%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 47% decrease in the average outstanding balance of our financing facilities due to the reduction in inventory levels as a result of our initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was partially offset by interest expenses related to the $178 million in convertible notes issued in the second half of 2019 and outstanding until September 2020.
Other Income - Net
Other income - net decreased by $9 million, or 69%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest income from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of cash generated from our operations and from financing activities. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion, restricted cash of $847 million, and marketable securities of $484 million. The Company had total outstanding balances on our asset-backed debt and other secured borrowings of $6.1 billion and aggregate principal outstanding from Convertible Senior Notes of $978 million. In addition, we had undrawn borrowing capacity of $4.7 billion under our non-recourse asset-backed debt facilities (as described further below), of which $2.8 billion was fully committed.
On February 9, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “February 2021 Offering”) in which we sold 32,817,421 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $27.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 4,280,533 additional shares of common stock, which was completed on
February 11, 2021. We received aggregate net proceeds from the February 2021 Offering of approximately $859 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
In August 2021, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $978 million, which resulted in net proceeds after underwriting fees and other transactions costs of $953 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company purchased capped calls from certain financial institutions at a cost of $119 million.
We have incurred losses from inception through December 31, 2021 and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to service our debt, fund working capital, business operations and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to our future operating success, and obtain inventory acquisition financing on reasonable terms, which is subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, political and financial market conditions.
We expect our working capital requirements to continue to increase in the immediate future, as we seek to increase our inventory and expand into more markets across the United States. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and borrowings, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Debt and Financing Arrangements
Our financing activities include: short-term borrowings under our asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities and our mortgage repurchase financing; the issuance of long-term asset-backed senior term debt, asset-backed mezzanine term debt, and convertible debt; and new issuances of equity. Historically, we have required access to external financing resources in order to fund growth, expansion into new markets and strategic initiatives and we expect this to continue in the future. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions.
We primarily use non-recourse asset-backed debt, consisting of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities, to provide financing for our real estate inventory purchases and renovations. Our business is capital intensive and maintaining adequate liquidity and capital resources is needed as we continue to scale and accumulate additional inventory. While there can be no assurance that these trends will continue, we have observed increased availability and engagement for this lending product across a variety of financial institutions and we have seen improved terms and an increase in our borrowing capacity in recent years. We actively manage our relationships with multiple financial institutions and seek to optimize duration, flexibility, efficiency and cost of funds.
Our asset-backed facilities are each collateralized by a specified pool of assets, consisting of real estate inventory, restricted cash and equity interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of Opendoor that directly or indirectly own our real estate inventory.
Our real estate-owning subsidiaries’ assets and credit generally are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of any other Opendoor entities except to the extent other Opendoor entities are also a party to the relevant financing arrangements. Our asset-backed debt is non-recourse to Opendoor except for limited guarantees provided by an Opendoor subsidiary for certain obligations in situations involving “bad acts” by an Opendoor entity and certain other limited circumstances that are generally under our control.
Our asset-backed senior debt facilities generally provide for advance rates of 80% to 90% against our cost basis in the underlying properties upon acquisition and our mezzanine term facilities will finance up to 100% of our cost basis in the underlying properties upon acquisition. The maximum initial advance rates for a given financed property vary by facility and generally decrease on a fixed timeline that varies by facility based on the length of time the property has been financed and any other facility-specific adjustments.
The following table summarizes certain details related to our non-recourse asset-backed debt and other secured borrowings as of December 31, 2021 (in millions, except interest rates):
Asset-backed Senior Revolving Credit Facilities
We classify the senior revolving credit facilities as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. In some cases, the borrowing capacity amounts under the asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities as reflected in the table are not fully committed and any borrowings above those amounts are subject to the applicable lender’s discretion. As of December 31, 2021, we had fully committed borrowing capacity with respect to asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities of $3.9 billion.
The revolving period end dates and final maturity dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. Certain of our asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities also have additional extension options that are subject to lender approval that are not reflected in the table above.
Asset-backed Senior Term Debt Facilities
We classify our senior term debt facilities as non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the non-current liabilities is reduced by issuance costs of $3 million. In some cases, the borrowing capacity amounts under the asset-backed senior term debt facilities as reflected in the table are not fully committed and any borrowings above those
amounts are subject to the applicable lender’s discretion. As of December 31, 2021, we had fully committed borrowing capacity with respect to asset-backed senior term debt facilities of $1.7 billion.
The withdrawal period end dates and final maturity dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. Certain of our asset-backed senior term debt facilities also have additional extension options that are subject to lender approval that are not reflected in the table above.
Asset-backed Mezzanine Term Debt Facilities
In addition to the asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities and asset-backed senior term debt facilities, we have issued asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities which are subordinated to the related senior facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we had fully committed borrowing capacity with respect to asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities of $2.3 billion. Any borrowings above those amounts are not fully committed and subject to the applicable lender’s discretion.
Mortgage Financing
We primarily use debt financing to fund our mortgage loan originations. In 2019 we entered into a master repurchase agreement to finance substantially all of the mortgage loans that we originate. Once our mortgage business sells a loan in the secondary mortgage market, we use the sale proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance under the repurchase facility.
Convertible Senior Notes
In August 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $978 million. The table below summarizes certain details related to our 2026 Notes (in millions):
See “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt” for additional information regarding our debt and financing arrangements.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(5.8) billion, $682 million and $(272) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by a $5.7 billion increase in real estate inventory and an $83 million increase in escrow receivables correlated to the increase in revenue during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an $834 million reduction in real estate inventory offset by our net loss net of non-cash items of $149 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities reflected primarily our net loss net of non-cash items of $258 million and our change in operating working capital of ($11) million.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $476 million, $22 million and $95 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of $394 million in investments in marketable securities, $33 million for the acquisitions of Pro.com and RedDoor, net of cash acquired, the $15 million purchase of strategic investments in certain privately held companies and $33 million in capital expenditures, including internally developed software. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures, including internally developed software. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities primarily reflected the purchase, net of sales, of marketable securities in the amount of $34 million. In addition, we acquired OSN for $33 million and spent $28 million on capital expenditures, including internally developed software, computers and leasehold improvements.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $7.3 billion, $161 million and $646 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $5.7 billion net proceeds from asset-backed debt and $886 million in proceeds from the February 2021 Offering, net of $29 million of issuance costs. In addition, we received $978 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, net of $25 million of issuance costs and offset by $119 million purchase of the Capped Calls related to the 2026 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the Business Combination and PIPE Investment in the amount of $1.0 billion, partially offset by the repayment of $816 million of our asset-backed debt and other secured borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was driven by proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and convertible notes, as well as net proceeds from the senior revolving credit facilities and mezzanine term debt facilities to acquire new inventory.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Contractual obligations are cash amounts that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered into during the normal course of business. Below is a table that shows our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:
________________
(1)Represents the principal amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Includes estimated interest payments, calculated using the variable rate in existence at period end over an assumed holding period of 90 days. Borrowings under the senior revolving credit facilities are payable as the related inventory is sold. The payment is expected to be within one year of December 31, 2021.
(2)Represents the principal amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and interest payments assuming the principal balances remain outstanding until maturity. The final maturity dates of the senior and mezzanine term debt facilities vary, as discussed above.
(3)Represents the principal amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and interest payments assuming the principal balances remain outstanding until maturity.
(4)Represents the principal amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The facility provides short-term financing between the origination of a mortgage loan and when Opendoor Home Loans sells the loan to an investor. Included estimated
interest payments, calculated using the variable rate in existence at period end over the Company’s average holding period for mortgage loans.
(5)Represents future payments for long-term operating leases that have commenced as of December 31, 2021.
(6)As of December 31, 2021, we were under contract to purchase 5,411 homes for an aggregate purchase price of $1.9 billion.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue, and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below. In addition, we have other key accounting policies and estimates that are described in “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1. Description of Business and Accounting Policies”.
Real Estate Inventory
Real estate inventory carrying value is equal to the lower of cost or net realizable value and each home constitutes the unit of account. Real estate inventory cost includes but is not limited to the property purchase price, acquisition costs and direct costs to renovate or repair the home, less inventory valuation adjustments, if any. The property purchase price is net of our service fee and represents the cash proceeds paid to the home seller. Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments on a quarterly basis. If the carrying amount for a given home is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the home’s carrying value is adjusted to its net realizable value. For homes under contract, the net realizable value is the contract price less expected selling costs and any expected concessions. For all other homes, the net realizable value is our internal projection price less expected selling costs. Changes in our pricing assumptions may lead to a change in the outcome of our inventory valuation adjustment, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based awards include stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and shares of restricted stock (“Restricted Shares”).
We recognize the cost of stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. Cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. We elected to recognize the effect of forfeitures in the period that they occur. We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions:
•Expected Term. We use the simplified method when calculating the expected term due to insufficient historical exercise data. Management elected to use the simplified method instead of historical experience due to a lack of relevant historical data resulting from changes in option vesting schedules and changes in the pool of employees receiving option grants.
•Expected Volatility. As our shares were not actively traded on Nasdaq until December 2020, the volatility used for stock options granted prior to the Company becoming listed is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the automotive sales industry and certain real estate technology companies. For stock options granted after the Company became listed, we use the implied volatility from traded Opendoor call options.
•Expected Dividend Yield. The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate. The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.
We evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on each grant date. Following the Company’s common stock being listed on Nasdaq, the fair value of our stock has been determined based on the quoted market price. Prior to our common stock being listed on Nasdaq, the grant date fair value of our common stock was determined with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation specialist. The grant date fair value of our common stock was determined using valuation methodologies which utilize certain assumptions, including probability weighting of events, volatility, time to liquidation, a risk-free interest rate, and an assumption for a discount for lack of marketability.
Prior to our common stock being listed on Nasdaq, we determined that an Option Pricing Model (“OPM”) was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock. Application of the OPM involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of future events. Specifically, we have historically used the OPM back solve analysis in combination with the market comparables approach to estimate the fair value of our common stock. OPM back solve analysis derives the implied equity value for one type of equity security from a contemporaneous transaction involving another type of security; we utilized the OPM back solve analysis with respect to our convertible preferred stock to derive a value of our common stock. In certain periods where there is not a contemporaneous transaction, we utilized the market comparables approach to estimate an enterprise equity valuation which is then allocated using OPM to determine the common stock value.
The grant date fair value calculated using the methodology discussed above is also utilized with respect to RSUs with performance and service conditions to vest and restricted shares. For RSUs with a performance condition based on a liquidity event, as well as a service condition to vest, no compensation expense is recognized until the performance condition has been satisfied. Subsequent to the liquidity event, compensation expense is recognized to the extent the requisite service period has been completed and compensation expense thereafter is recognized on an accelerated attribution method. Under the accelerated attribution method, compensation expense is recognized over the remaining requisite service period for each service condition tranche as though each tranche is, in substance, a separate award. In February 2021, the Company completed an underwritten public offering, which met the liquidity event vesting condition and triggered the recognition of compensation expense for RSUs for which the time-based vesting condition had been satisfied or partially satisfied. For further information on the February 2021 underwritten public offering, see “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13. Shareholders’ Equity”.
We determined the grant date fair value of RSUs with market-based vesting conditions by using Monte Carlo simulations. The assumptions for stock price volatility, contractual term, dividend yield, and stock price used in the Monte Carlo simulations are determined using the same methodology as described above. The exception is that with respect to the stock price volatility used for the Monte Carlo simulations, the Company took into consideration the capital structure of each comparable company comprising the benchmark to isolate each comparable company’s equity volatility without the effect of leverage and then re-levered using our capital structure. If we consider the performance conditions probable to be satisfied, we recognize the cost of these RSUs by treating each market-based condition as an unit of account and recognizing the cost over the requisite service period with respect to each unit. We determine the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, if any, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different. For more detailed information about our historical and outstanding grants and our valuation of our share-based compensation and awards, see “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14. Share-Based Awards”.
Public and Sponsor Warrants
On April 30, 2020, SCH consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 41,400,000 units, consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one third of one warrant exercisable for Class A common stock, at a price of $10.00 per unit. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share
(the “Public Warrants”). Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, SCH completed the private placement of 6,133,333 warrants to SCH’s sponsor at a price of $1.50 per warrant (the “Sponsor Warrants”). Each Sponsor Warrant allowed the sponsor to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share.
The Sponsor Warrants and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of Sponsor Warrants may not be transferred, assigned, or sold until 30 days after the completion of a business combination. Additionally, the Sponsor Warrants are eligible for cash and cashless exercises, at the holder’s option, and are redeemable only if the Reference Value, as defined in the Warrant Agreement, is less than $18.00 per share.
We evaluated the Public and Sponsor Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and concluded that the Sponsor Warrants did not meet the criteria to be classified in shareholders’ equity. Specifically the exercise and settlement features for the Sponsor Warrants precluded them from being considered indexed to the Company’s own stock given that a change in the holder of the Sponsor Warrants may alter the settlement of the Sponsor Warrants. Since the holder of the instrument is not an input to a standard option pricing model, a consideration with respect to the indexation guidance, a change in the holder for the Sponsor Warrants impacting their value means the Sponsor Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s own stock. Since the Sponsor Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, we recorded these warrants as liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value upon the consummation of the Business Combination, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each reporting period. The Company concluded that the Public Warrants, which did not have the same exercise and settlement features as the Sponsor Warrants, meet the criteria to be classified in shareholders' equity.
On July 9, 2021, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding Public and Sponsor Warrants and in connection with the redemption, the Public Warrants stopped trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
