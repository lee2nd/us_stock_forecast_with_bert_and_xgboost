Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and results of operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Overview
Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation develops and markets in-vitro diagnostic tests for over-the-counter, or consumer-use and point-of-care which includes hospitals, physicians’ offices and medical clinics, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad. The Company currently markets a range of diagnostic test kits for consumer use through OTC sales, and for use by health care professionals, generally located at medical clinics, physician offices and hospitals known POC, in the United States. These test kits are known as in-vitro diagnostic test kits or IVD products.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
As of June 30, 2022, we had negative working capital of $1,575,766, and a cash balance of $0. Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue to operate, additional financing will be necessary. During July 2022, the Company sold $239,675 face value of promissory notes from which the Company received $206,250 in proceeds. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to expand the range and scope of our business operations. We will seek access to private or public equity but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Results of Operations
Year ended June 30, 2022 compared with the year ended June 30, 2021
Revenue and Cost of Revenue
During fiscal 2022, the Company’s sales included a $7,000 sale to a related party. Sales decreased due to the Company’s inability to secure and market test items. The cost of revenue in 2022 and 2021 included inventory adjustments of $115,681 and 171,811, respectively, due to shelf-life expiration of our products
Professional Fees
Professional fees relate to expenditures incurred primarily for legal, accounting and financing services. During fiscal 2022 professional fees increased primarily due to higher legal fees incurred related to the February 17, 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of California, for additional information see the notes to our financial statements, “NOTE 9 - Commitments and Contingencies”.
Research and Product Development
Research and Product Development (“R&D”) costs represent costs incurred to develop our tests and are incurred pursuant to certain internal R&D cost allocations, when applicable, and agreements with third-party providers, but primarily with Pan Probe Biotech, owned by Dr. Shujie Cui, our Chief Science Officer. R&D costs are expensed when incurred. During fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, R&D costs increased due to the development of a COVID antigen test.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) costs include all expenditures related to personnel, rent, travel, public company costs, utilities, marketing and other office related costs. SG&A costs increased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due increases in personnel costs of $127,500, travel and meals of $38,020, rent of $84,427, utilities of $31,363, impairment charges of $26,418, marketing costs of $155,672 and other SG&A costs of $2,188.
Stock Compensation
Stock compensation represents the expense associated with the issuance of stock in exchange for services and is non-cash in nature. Stock compensation is based on our stock price at the measurement date and can fluctuate significantly as a result. Stock compensation expense in fiscal 2022 consisted of the issuance of 16,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at a weighted average price of $0.11 per share compared to the fiscal 2021 issuance of 2,950,000 shares of restricted common stock at a weighted average price of $0.86 per share. All shares were issued free of obligation.
Other Income and (Expense)
Other expense includes “interest expense” which relates to the stated interest and penalties upon default of our outstanding promissory notes, and “amortization of debt discount” which represents the accretion of the discount applied to our notes as a result of the issuance of detachable warrants, the beneficial conversion feature contained certain notes and deductions from the proceeds of the promissory notes for various related fees. During fiscal 2022, interest expense included $191,400 of liquidated damages and penalties due to our default on the Firstfire Notes and $79,200 of interest expense related to the Firstfire Notes and $90,466 related to our promissory notes.
During fiscal 2021, the company recognized $64,732 of interest expense related to your outstanding promissory notes and $737,569 related to the July 22, 2020 Common Stock Purchase Agreement with EMC2 Capital, LLC and related Commitment Warrants valued at $737,569.
The loss on related party transfer of intangible assets represents value of two separate, exclusive, five-year, license agreements between the Company and Charles Strongo, our former CEO, one for the manufacture of Biodegradable plastic for medical devices under provisional patent 63/054,139 and the second license agreement for the use of the intellectual property described as “a Rapid, Micro-Well or Later flow test for Parkinson’s, Dementia, or Alzheimer or ASD” (collectively, the “License Agreements”). The License Agreements were both executed on January 12, 2021 and March 30, 2021. In exchange for entering into the License Agreements, the Company issued a total of 8 million shares of restricted common stock with a market value of $4,480,000. Due to this being a related party transfer with no available historical cost records, the full value of the stock issued was recorded as a loss.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2022, the Company had no cash and a bank overdraft of $1,230 and current liabilities of $1,719,380. From inception to June 30, 2022, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,937,685. This loss has been incurred through a combination of professional fees, R&D, SG&A and non-cash stock related costs of $13,235,369 to support our plans to develop our business. During fiscal 2022, the Company had negligible revenues and used cash in operations of $1,968,207. The Company has incurred losses since inception and may not be able to generate sufficient net revenue from its business in the future to achieve or sustain profitability. The Company currently has insufficient funds to operate over the next twelve months. To finance our operations, we have entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with EMC2 Capital LLC, which provided us with $1,476,872 during fiscal 2022. Additionally, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and related 12% senior secured convertible promissory note on June 18, 2021 and August 27, 2021, under which the Company received net proceeds of $224,500 on July 8, 2021 and $313,700 on September 2, 2021. Subsequent to fiscal 2022, in July 2022, the Company sold $239,675 face value of promissory notes from which the Company received $206,250 in proceeds. We are currently pursuing additional funds through equity or debt financing or a combination thereof. However, aside from the EMC2 SPA, the Company has no commitments to obtain any such financing, and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on its historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Due to the level of activity and lack of complex transactions, we believe there are currently no critical accounting policies and estimates that affect the preparation of our financial statements.
