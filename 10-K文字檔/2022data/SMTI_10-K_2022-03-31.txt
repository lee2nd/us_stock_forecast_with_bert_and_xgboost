ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about future revenues, operating results, plans and expectations. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Also, please read the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” set forth at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related Notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative technologies to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures in the surgical and chronic wound and skin care markets. Our portfolio of products and services will allow us to deliver comprehensive wound and skin care solutions for patients in all care settings, including acute (hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACHs”)) and post-acute (wound care clinics, physician offices, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), home health, hospice, and retail). Each of our products, services, and technologies contributes to our overall goal of achieving better clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost for patients regardless of where they receive care. We strive to be one of the most innovative and comprehensive providers of effective wound and skin care products and technologies and are continually seeking to expand our offerings for patients requiring wound and skin care treatments across the entire continuum of care in the United States.
We currently market several products across surgical and chronic wound care applications and have multiple products in our pipeline. We license our products from Applied Nutritionals, LLC (“AN”) (through a sublicense with CGI Cellerate RX, LLC (“CGI Cellerate RX”), an affiliate of The Catalyst Group, Inc. (“Catalyst”)) and Rochal Industries, LLC (“Rochal”) and have the right to exclusively distribute certain products manufactured by Cook Biotech Inc. (“Cook Biotech”).
In June 2020, we formed a subsidiary, United Wound and Skin Solutions LLC (“UWSS”, or “WounDerm”), to hold certain investments and operations in wound and skin care virtual consult services. We anticipate that our various service offerings will allow clinicians/physicians utilizing our technologies to collect and analyze large amounts of data on patient conditions and outcomes that will improve treatment protocols and ultimately lead to more evidence-based formulary to improve patient outcomes. Through a combination of our WounDerm services and our Sanara products, we believe we will be able to offer patient care solutions at every step in the continuum of wound and skin care from diagnosis through healing.
Effective July 1, 2021, we acquired certain assets from Rochal, including, among others, intellectual property, four FDA 510(k) clearances, rights to license certain products and technologies currently under development, equipment and supplies. As a result of the asset purchase, our pipeline now contains product candidates for mitigation of opportunistic pathogens and biofilm, wound re-epithelialization and closure, necrotic tissue debridement and cell compatible substrates.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in March 2020, many states issued orders suspending elective surgeries in order to free-up hospital resources to treat COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a reduction in demand for our surgical products beginning in the second half of March 2020. Additionally, most states limited access to SNFs to only resident caregivers, which impeded our ability to provide education and product training to the clinicians who use our products in these facilities. These restrictions resulted in an overall decline in sales for the second quarter of 2020. During the second half of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, we saw a strong rebound in product sales as restrictions on elective surgeries eased in our primary markets in Texas, Florida, and the southeastern United States. During the second half of 2021, the United States experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases as the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus impacted much of the country and negatively impacted our sales in Texas, the northeastern United States, and other markets.
The duration and effects of the pandemic remain uncertain; however, management believes that elective surgical procedures will continue to be performed with the exception of certain geographic hotspots. Additionally, management believes that the majority of surgical procedures impacted by COVID-19 and its variants will ultimately be performed. We will continue to closely monitor the pandemic in order to ensure the safety of our people and our ability to serve our customers and patients.
Components of Results of Operations
Sources of Revenues
Our revenue is derived primarily from sales of our surgical wound care products to hospitals and other acute care facilities, and sales of our chronic wound care products to customers across the post-acute continuum of care. Our revenue is driven by direct orders shipped by us to our customers, and to a lesser extent, direct sales to customers through delivery at the time of procedure by one of our sales representatives. We generally recognize revenue when our product is received by the customer.
The vast majority of our product sales revenue is derived from sales of CellerateRX surgical powder. Revenue streams from product sales and royalties are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. All revenue was generated in the United States.
We recognize royalty revenue from a development and licensing agreement with BioStructures, LLC. We record revenue each calendar quarter as earned per the terms of the agreement, which stipulates that we will receive quarterly royalty payments of at least $50,250. Under the terms of the development and license agreement, royalties of 2.0% are recognized on sales of products containing our patented resorbable bone hemostasis. The minimum annual royalty due to us is $201,000 per year throughout the life of the patent, which expires in 2023. These royalties are payable in quarterly installments of $50,250. To date, royalties related to this development and licensing agreement have not exceeded the annual minimum of $201,000 ($50,250 per quarter).
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold consists of the acquisition costs from the manufacturers of our licensed products, raw material costs for certain components sourced directly by our Company, and all royalties related due as a result of the sale of our products. Our gross profit represents total revenue less the cost of goods sold, and gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue.
Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) consist primarily of salaries, sales commissions, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. SG&A also includes outside legal counsel, audit fees, insurance premiums, rent, and other corporate expenses. We expense all SG&A expenses as incurred. We expect our SG&A expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percent of revenue as we grow our commercial organization.
Research and development expenses (“R&D”) include costs related to enhancements to our currently available products and additional investments in our product and platform development pipelines. This includes personnel-related expenses, including salaries and benefits for all personnel directly engaged in R&D activities, contracted services, materials, prototype expenses and allocated overhead, which is comprised of lease expense and other facilities-related costs. We expense R&D costs as incurred. We generally expect that R&D expenses will increase as we continue to support product enhancements as well as to bring new products to market.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) is primarily comprised of gains or losses on equity method investments, interest income, interest expense and other non-operating activities. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Results of Operations
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated revenues of $24,143,919 compared to revenues of $15,586,976 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 55% increase from the prior year. The higher revenues in 2021 were due to increased sales of surgical wound care products as we continued the execution of our strategy to expand our sales force and independent distribution network in both new and existing U.S. markets. As discussed above under “-Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,” our sales have been adversely impacted in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the duration and future impact of the pandemic remain uncertain.
Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,311,221, compared to costs of goods sold of $1,616,625 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margins were approximately 90% for both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $28,053,176, compared to SG&A expenses of $18,673,404 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher SG&A expenses in 2021 were primarily due to increased selling costs resulting from sales force expansion and operational support, higher sales commission expense as a result of higher product sales, higher non-cash equity compensation costs, higher payroll costs related to the mid-year addition of the Rochal workforce, and higher costs associated with the launch of our WounDerm technology platform. In addition, costs related to travel and in-person promotional activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 as many in-person activities were cancelled or postponed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our continued strategy to expand our sales reach in new and existing markets, we employed eleven additional field sales managers since December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 30 field sales managers.
Research and development expenses. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $558,704 compared to $40,190 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher R&D expenses in 2021 were due to costs associated with several development projects for our currently licensed products and technologies.
Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the period ended December 31, 2021 was $596,975 compared to $291,370 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2021 was due to the amortization of internal use software placed into service in 2021, and due to additional amortization related to the patents acquired from Rochal.
Other expense. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $617,638 compared to other income of $589,468 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher expense in 2021 was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of $616,927 from our equity method investment in Precision Healing Inc. (“Precision Healing”). Interest expense was $711 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $11,528 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher interest expense in 2020 was due to interest expense associated with our unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (described in further detail below), and interest on a convertible promissory note which was converted to common stock in early 2020.
Net income / loss. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $7,993,795, compared to net loss of $4,445,145 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher net loss in 2021 was due to increased SG&A costs described above, higher R&D expenses, and the recognition of losses on our equity method investment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash on hand at December 31, 2021 was $18,652,841, compared to $455,366 at December 31, 2020. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily from the sale of equity securities. In 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash generated from operations, availability of our bank line of credit, and cash provided by an unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program in the principal amount of $583,000 (the “PPP Loan”) to Cadence Bank, N.A. (“Cadence”). All principal and interest under the PPP Loan were forgiven in 2020. On February 12, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,265,000 shares of our common stock (including 165,000 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock) at a public offering price of $25.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $31,625,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We expect our future needs for cash to include expanding our salesforce, further development of our products, services and technologies pipeline, clinical studies and general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions. Based on our current plan of operations, including potential acquisitions, we believe our cash on hand, when combined with expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or fund any potential future acquisitions or other similar transactions depends on operating and economic conditions, some of which are beyond our control. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. We are continuing to evaluate all uses of cash, including opportunistic acquisitions, and whether to pursue growth opportunities and whether such growth opportunities, additional sources of liquidity, including equity and/or debt financings, are appropriate to fund any such growth opportunities.
On January 15, 2021, we entered into a new loan agreement with Cadence (the “Loan Agreement”), providing for a $2.5 million revolving line of credit. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the revolving line of credit was set to mature on January 13, 2023 and was secured by substantially all of our assets.
On February 11, 2021, we made an $800,000 draw on the revolving line of credit. On February 19, 2021, we paid down the entire balance of the revolving line of credit. Effective March 25, 2022, we terminated Loan Agreement and released Cadence from any obligation to make advances under the Loan Agreement. No amounts of principal, interest or other fees and expenses were owed by the Company as of the termination date. There is no assurance that we will enter into an additional loan agreement with Cadence or with another bank on similar terms, or at all.
On November 9, 2020, we entered into agreements to purchase shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Stock”) of Precision Healing for an aggregate purchase price of $600,000. In 2021, we made additional purchases of Series A Stock as follows: $600,000 in February, $500,000 in June, $500,000 in October, and $600,000 in December of 2021.
On July 7, 2019, we executed a license agreement with Rochal whereby we acquired an exclusive world-wide license to market, sell and further develop antimicrobial products for the prevention and treatment of microbes on the human body utilizing certain Rochal patents and pending patent applications (the “BIAKŌS License Agreement”). Under the terms of the BIAKŌS License Agreement, we agreed to pay Rochal $750,000 upon the completion of a capital raise, on or before December 31, 2022, of at least $10,000,000 through the sale of our common stock or assets. In March 2021, we issued 20,834 shares of our common stock to Rochal as full payment of the $750,000, which became due upon the completion of our capital raise in February 2021.
On June 3, 2021, we invested $2,084,278 for 278,587 Class A Preferred Shares (the “Shares”) of Canada based Pixalere Healthcare, Inc. (“Pixalere”). The Shares are convertible into 28.6% of the outstanding equity of Pixalere. Pixalere provides a cloud-based wound care software tool that empowers nurses, specialists and administrators to deliver better care for patients. In connection with our purchase of the Shares, Pixalere granted Pixalere Healthcare USA, LLC (“Pixalere USA”), our subsidiary, a royalty-free exclusive license to use the Pixalere software and platform in the United States. In conjunction with the grant of the license, we issued Pixalere a 27.3% equity ownership interest in Pixalere USA.
On July 14, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rochal, effective July 1, 2021, pursuant to which we purchased certain assets of Rochal, including, among others, certain of Rochal’s intellectual property, furniture and equipment, supplies, rights and claims, other than certain excluded assets, and assumed certain liabilities upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the asset purchase agreement. In exchange for the acquired assets, we paid Rochal (i) $496,100 in cash and (ii) 14,369 shares of common stock.
On July 17, 2020, we purchased Series B-2 Preferred Shares of Direct Dermatology Inc. for $500,000. We made additional investments in the Series B-2 Preferred Shares in the amounts of $125,000 in November 2021 and $125,000 in December of 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $4,814,526 compared to $4,034,518 used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher use of cash in 2021 was primarily due to higher operating expenses related to sales force expansion, research and development, and the launch of our WounDerm technology platform.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $5,284,731 compared to $2,744,374 used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash used in investing activities during 2021 included $496,100 for the Rochal asset acquisition, and our investments in non-marketable equity securities including $2.2 million for Precision Healing Inc. Series A-2 Preferred Shares, $2.0 million for Pixalere Healthcare Inc. Class A Preferred Shares, and $250,000 for DirectDerm Series B-2 Preferred Shares.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $28,296,732 as compared to $622,330 provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was due to proceeds received pursuant to an underwritten public offering of 1,265,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $31,625,000, before underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from these estimates. We have identified certain significant accounting policies and estimates which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in making certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, as summarized below.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring those goods or services. Revenue is recognized based on the following five step model:
- Identification of the contract with a customer
- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
- Determination of the transaction price
- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
- Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles held and to be used by our Company, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, including the COVID-19 pandemic, indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We continuously evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such long-lived assets and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, undiscounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. No impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Investment in Equity Securities
Our equity investments consist of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. Unless accounted for under the equity method of accounting, the investments are reported at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
We apply the equity method of accounting to investments when it has significant influence, but not controlling interest, in the investee. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. Our proportionate share of the net income (loss) resulting from these investments is reported under the line item captioned “Share of losses from equity method investment” in our consolidated statements of operations. Our equity method investments are adjusted each period for our share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid, if any. We classify distributions received from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
We have reviewed the carrying value of our investments and have determined there was no impairment or observable price changes as of December 31, 2021.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories consist of finished goods and related packaging components. We recorded inventory obsolescence expense of $251,826 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $318,076 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory had a balance of $333,850 at December 31, 2021, and $276,603 at December 31, 2020. We considered the impact of COVID-19 on its recorded value of inventory and determined no additional adjustment was necessary as of December 31, 2021.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. We considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our estimates and assumptions and determined there was not a material impact on our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020; however, actual results could differ from those estimates and there may be changes to our estimates in future periods.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740, “Income Taxes.” This standard requires us to provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to the expected future tax benefit or expense of temporary reporting differences between book and tax accounting and any available operating loss or tax credit carry forwards.
After applying the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the unexpired net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forward at December 31, 2020 was approximately $20.7 million, of which, approximately $5.1 million generated in 2017 and prior, will expire between 2022 and 2037. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the NOL generated during the years 2018 through 2021 of approximately $15.6 million will have an indefinite carryforward period but can generally only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any particular year. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of NOL carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in NOLs expiring unused.
The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
A 100% valuation allowance has been provided for all deferred tax assets, as our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future is uncertain.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
