B. Critical Accounting Policies:
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of the matters that are inherently uncertain.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses and related services. The Company’s revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from contract with customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company transferred promised goods and services to the customer and in the amount that reflect the consideration to which the company expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
The following five steps are followed in recognizing revenue from contracts:
● Identify the contract with the customer;
● Identify the performance obligation of the contract;
● Determine the transaction price;
● Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and;
● Recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation.
The consideration for the transaction (performance obligation(s) is determined as per the agreement or contract or invoice for the services and products.
DuoSubscribe
Duo Subscribe is a solution for Subscriber Management and Billing. With over a decade of experience in developing applications for these sectors and having vast amount of domain knowledge on how these sectors operate, Duo Subscribe is eminently capable of meeting the complex and rigorous demands of businesses around the world.

Smoothflow
Smoothflow automates customer engagements, including building ChatBots, VoiceBots and IoTBots to deliver an Omni channel customer service experience. The product uses the power of artificial intelligence to keep improving the conversational flow and user experience.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Nature of Products and Services
Licenses for on premise software licenses. The Company sells a perpetual nonexclusive license to the customer and enable customer to install and use the software and its documentation. Price per customer varies based on the selection of the products licensed, the number of site installations and the number of authorized users. The products offered on this basis are “DuoSubscribe” and “Facetone-enterprise.”
Hosted and reseller solutions. Company distributes its software product ‘Facetone-hosted version” with third party telecommunication companies. It is a revenue model where the Tele-communication provider hosts DUO’s software applications on its platform, and makes it available to its customers over the Internet for a monthly subscription fee. Company charge telecommunication service provider a monthly license fee calculated according to the number of licenses sold.
Cloud Services. Company sells its product Smoothflow as a “SaaS” product (Software-as-a-Service) and services are provided for a monthly subscription.
Annual maintenance contracts. The Company offers annual maintenance programs for the ‘on premises solution’ licenses sold and this provides for technical support and updates to the Company’s software solutions. Initial annual maintenance fees are bundled with license fees in the initial licensing period and recognized when the performance obligation of license fee is met. Revenue is recognized ratably, or daily, over the term of the maintenance period, which is typically one year.
Provisions
A provision is recognized when the Company has present obligations as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimate can be made of amount of the obligation. Provisions are not discounted at their present value and are determined based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. All of our revenues are normally generated in U.S. dollars or Sri Lankan rupees. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which are primarily in Asia and to a lesser extent in the U.S. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we plan to generate revenues in foreign currencies and we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
C. Results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021:
In March 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 Coronavirus caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a Global Pandemic by the World Health Organization, and the outbreak has become increasingly widespread all over the World, including the geographical locations in which our Company and our subsidiaries operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic has and will continue affecting economies and businesses around the World. The Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak. The impacts of the Pandemic could be material, but, due to the evolving nature of this situation, we are not able at this time to estimate the impact on our current financial, operational or future financial results. Among the factors that could impact our results are: effectiveness of COVID-19 Coronavirus mitigation measures, development of effective vaccines and boosters (if deemed necessary), development of effective therapeutics, global and regional economic conditions, reduced business and consumer spending due to both job losses and reduced investment activity, and other factors beyond our control.
