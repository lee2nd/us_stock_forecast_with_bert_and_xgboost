Recent Developments
COVID-19
COVID-19 (the “Pandemic”) continues to cause significant disruption to public health, the global economy, financial markets, and commercial, social and community activity in general. As there has been a reduction in government restrictions, we see reduced risk to our business. We continue to monitor potential risks the Pandemic may present including a potential resurgence. Our exposure to the Pandemic is manifold. The majority of our employees continue to work remotely however strict “shelter-in-place” or “stay-at-home” orders have been lifted. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the hospitality sector within the U.S. which remains under stress due to the threats of resurgence and resource shortages that resulted from the Pandemic.
We have continued to provide customer service, process new and renewal business, handle claims and otherwise manage all operations even though the vast majority of the staff is working remotely. To date, we have not seen a major disruption in our business as a result of the Pandemic and currently do not expect to see a material negative impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of the Pandemic.
Sale of Certain Agency Business
On June 30, 2021, our agency (Sycamore Insurance Agency) sold to Venture Agency Holdings, Inc., a related party, the customer accounts and other related assets of some of its personal and commercial lines of business (the “Venture Transaction”). Sycamore will continue to produce various personal and commercial lines that it did not sell which is substantially all produced for, and underwritten by, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. We recognized an $8.9 million gain on the sale which is reflected in Other Gains in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In order to determine the value of the portion of the business sold, the Company obtained a third party valuation based on a weighting of discounted cash flows and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple valuation methods. The valuation included significant estimates and assumptions related to (i) forecasted revenue and EBITDA and (ii) the selection of the EBITDA multiple and discount rate.
The purchase price was $10.0 million of which $1.0 million was paid in cash on June 30, 2021, and $9.0 million was in the form of two promissory notes (one for $6.0 million and one for $3.0 million). Both notes require interest-only quarterly
payments at a per annum rate of 7.0%, with a five-year maturity. There are no prepayment penalties. On December 14, 2021, Venture paid off the $3.0 million note.
The assets sold included the customer accounts (mainly agency-related new and renewal rights) of substantially all of the personal lines business and a small subset of the commercial lines business underwritten by our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, and all of the customer accounts Sycamore produced for third-party insurers. The Venture Transaction included the transition of 21 employees from Conifer to Venture as well as necessary systems and office functions to operate the business. Venture did not assume any in-force business or liabilities. The business will transition to Venture as it produces new or renewal business effective July 1, 2021. We expect our Insurance Company Subsidiaries will continue to underwrite substantially all of the business we sold to Venture that we underwrote prior to the transaction. We expect Venture to be able to grow both the business we underwrite as well as the third-party business more effectively as a separate entity outside of Conifer. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a non-controlling 50% interest in Venture.
Business Overview
We are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 45 states, including the District of Columbia. We are licensed to write insurance as an admitted carrier in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.
Our revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write.
Our expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents’ commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in three insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines, personal lines, and agency business. Together, the commercial and personal lines refer to “underwriting” operations that take insurance risk, and the agency business refers to non-risk insurance business.
Through our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers’ compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis.
Through our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance product line is primarily comprised of low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we offer in Illinois, Indiana and Texas. Due to ongoing Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners’ business and reducing our exposures in that state, as well as other wind-exposed states like Texas and Hawaii.
Through our wholesale agency business segment, we offer commercial and personal lines insurance products for our Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as third-party insurers. The wholesale agency business segment provides our agents with more insurance product options. However, as a result of the sale of certain agency business on June 30, 2021, going forward, our agency segment will not be producing any significant amounts of business for third party insurers and will produce approximately 50% less business for the Insurance Company Subsidiaries.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
General
We identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.
Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves
Our recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") reserves represent management’s best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of:
•
Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been reported; and
•
Incurred but not reported ("IBNR") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development on case reserves.
We do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.
Case reserves are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information and reduces case reserves as claims are paid. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:
•
The type of loss;
•
The severity of injury or damage;
•
Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;
•
The jurisdiction of the occurrence;
•
Policy provisions related to the claim;
•
Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and
•
Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim.
IBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves and paid loss and LAE from the estimated ultimate loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review Committee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries’ estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.
We use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including:
•
Written and earned premiums;
•
Paid and reported losses and LAE;
•
Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and
•
Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable.
The principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:
•
Loss ratio method-This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year;
•
Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date;
•
Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and
•
Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products.
Our actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.
Our actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year.
Our actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense ("ULAE") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.
We allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.
The estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to:
•
Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;
•
Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;
•
Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and
•
Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions.
Most or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.
Our reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.
The following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):
Although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.
Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.
We generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years’ maturity.
The following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2021. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2021 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year’s reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. The shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 21%, however due to the net operating losses (“NOL”) available to use against taxable income and the offsetting valuation allowance, there is no difference between pre-tax income and shareholders’ equity in this schedule. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.
Investment Valuation and Impairment
We carry debt securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in net income. We carry other equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at cost, less impairment and adjusted for observable price changes under the measurement alternative provided under GAAP. We review these investments for impairment during each reporting period. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.
We evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.
We consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer’s near term prospects. In addition, for debt securities, we consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis.
Fair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company’s best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. The Company also has investment company limited partnership investments, which are measured at net asset value (NAV). The fair value of these investments is based on the capital account balances reported by the investment funds subject to their management review and adjustment. The capital account balances reflect the fair value of the investment funds.
The fair values of debt and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).
The values for publicly-traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for debt securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturity.
We review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.
Income Taxes
As of December 31, 2021, we have federal and state income tax NOL carryforwards of $59.7 million and $17.0 million, respectively. Of the NOL carryforwards, $49.8 million will expire in tax years 2028 through 2041 and $9.9 million will never expire. Of the federal NOL amount, $12.8 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.
A valuation allowance of $14.6 million and $13.3 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three-year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2021 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. If the $14.6 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021 were reversed in the future, it would increase book value by $1.50 per share. The net deferred tax assets were zero as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
If, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Per Share
Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, the effects of tax reform, the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income, the change in the fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the capitalization and amortization of deferred gains from the ADC. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:
We use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.
Executive Overview
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to see growth in our commercial and personal lines in areas where we have had the most success. Our commercial lines gross written premiums increased by $14.3 million, or 13.9%, to $117.1 million in 2021, compared to $102.8 million in 2020. Personal lines gross written premiums increased by $6.4 million, or 75.2% to $15.0 million, compared to $8.6 million in 2020.
The Company reported a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.11 per share, in 2021, compared to net income of $595,000, or $0.06 per share, in 2020.
Adjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $13.6 million, or $1.40 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $8.0 million, or $0.83 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The 2021 results included an $8.9 million gain from the June 30, 2021 Venture Transaction, and a $2.8 million gain from the forgiveness of the PPP loan. Both gains are reflected in Other Gains on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also saw continued improvement in our current accident year underwriting results as our mix of business and other underwriting changes helped to produce a 2021 accident year combined ratio of 93.3%. These positive results were offset by $19.4 million of adverse development from prior accident years.
The Company experienced $2.0 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoverables, during 2021 from Winter Storm Uri. The Company had $86,000 of reinsurance reinstatement costs relating to Hurricane Irma in 2021.
The 2020 results were mainly driven by net realized investment gains, and net investment income of $8.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The largest difference between net income and the adjusted operating loss is related to the $8.4 million of net realized investment gains, and other gains, net of tax.
The impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to recede in 2020. Loss development on Hurricane Harvey was $89,000 in 2020 compared to $313,000 in 2019. Catastrophe reinstatement costs from Irma were $195,000 in 2020, compared to $495,000 in 2019.
Results of Operations - 2021 Compared to 2020
The following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):
Summary Operating Results
(1)
The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.
(2)
The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.
(3)
The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss.
* Percentage change is not meaningful
Premiums
Premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.
Our premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Summary of Premium Revenue
Gross written premiums increased by $20.8 million, or 18.6%, to $132.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to an increase in written premium in our small business and low-value dwelling programs, which was slightly offset by a decrease in written premium in our hospitality programs.
Commercial lines gross written premiums increased $14.3 million, or 13.9%, to $117.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by $20.3 million, or 31.1%, to $85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was offset by our hospitality programs gross written premiums, which decreased by $5.9 million, or 15.8%, to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Personal lines gross written premiums increased $6.4 million, or 75.2%, to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was largely driven by our low-value dwelling business.
Net written premiums increased $8.5 million, or 9.1%, to $101.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $92.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the increase in gross written premium during 2021. However, this increase was reduced by increased reinsurance rates, and the Company entering into a new specific loss commercial liability treaty on December 31, 2021, that included a 40% ceding commission and resulted in an additional $4.4 million of ceded written premiums at the inception of the agreement. Ceding commissions increased by $1.8 million as well. Ceded earned premiums and total acquisition costs were not impacted in 2021 from this new treaty, after taking into account the change in deferred acquisition costs. However, going forward, we would expect to see higher ceded earned premiums and lower acquisition costs as a result of this treaty.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings and policy issuance costs. Other income also includes the interest income from the $6.0 million and $3.0 million promissory notes relating to the Venture Transaction. The $3.0 million promissory note was paid down by Venture on December 14, 2021. Commission income is also received by the Company’s insurance agency for writing policies for third-party insurance companies. All of the third-party business was sold to Venture at June 30, 2021. Accordingly, other income from that business will diminish over the next few quarters as it transitions over to Venture, and
will ultimately no longer occur. Other income increased by $56,000, or 2.1%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.6 million in 2020. Other income relating to installment billings and policy issuance costs was lower in the second half of 2021, as the business that was sold to Venture at June 30, 2021, no longer produces other income for the Company. This was more than offset by an increase in the interest income in 2021 of $306,000 from the notes payable.
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).
Net losses and LAE increased by $13.6 million, or 24.2% to $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $56.2 million in 2020. The calendar year loss ratios were 70.5% and 62.8% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The $19.4 million of adverse development in 2021 consisted of $18.5 million from commercial lines and $957,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2019 and prior accident years.
The $15.6 million of adverse development in 2020 consisted of $15.2 million from commercial lines and $352,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2018 and 2017 accident years.
Expense Ratio
Our expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.
The table below provides the expense ratio by major component:
Our expense ratio decreased by 3.2%, to 42.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020.
Policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased by 1.0%, from 30.3% in 2020, to 29.3% in 2021.
Operating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 13.1% and 15.3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lower operating expense ratio was largely due to the Venture Transaction, where 21 employees transitioned from Conifer to Venture on June 30, 2021.
Underwriting Results
We measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Underwriting Gain (Loss)
Investment Income
Net investment income decreased by $1.2 million, or 37.6%, to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income in our debt securities due to lower interest rates. Average invested assets during 2021 were $183.0 million compared to $176.5 million for the same period in 2020. The investment portfolio was comprised of 82.5% debt securities, 7.6% equity securities, and 9.9% short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. The investment portfolio was comprised of 80.2% debt securities, 7.1% equity securities and 12.7% short-term investments as of December 31, 2020.
The debt securities portfolio had an average quality was AA and AA+ at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 1.4% and 1.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.6 years at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Realized Investment Gains
Net realized investment gains decreased by $5.3 million, or 64.6%, to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to overall market conditions in 2021 that reduced the Company’s ability to sell portions of its debt and equity securities for realized gains.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We issued $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the "Notes") in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company did not repurchase any of the Notes in 2021. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market in 2020. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the Subordinated Notes is $51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the Subordinated Notes.
The Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2021, and which contributed to interest expense. The Company had no outstanding balance on its line of credit as of December 31, 2021.
Income Tax Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported $5,000 of current federal income tax expense and $203,000 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
There is a $14.6 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021, which would increase book value by $1.50 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $13.3 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $59.7 million, of which $49.8 million expire in tax years 2028 through 2041 and $9.9 million never expire. Of this amount, $12.8 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.0 million, which expire in tax years 2022 through 2041.

Premiums
Premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.
Our premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
Summary of Premium Revenue
Gross written premiums increased by $9.5 million, or 9.3%, to $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $101.9 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to an increase in written premium in our small business programs, which was slightly offset by a decrease in written premium in our hospitality programs.
Commercial lines gross written premiums increased $8.4 million, or 8.9%, to $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by $19.1 million, or 41.5%, to $65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was offset by our hospitality programs gross written premiums, which decreased by $10.7 million, or 22.1%, to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Personal lines gross written premiums increased $1.1 million, or 14.9%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was largely driven by our low value dwelling business.
Net written premiums increased $5.2 million, or 5.9%, to $92.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $87.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the growth experienced in the commercial lines business. However, increased reinsurance rates tempered the growth of gross written premiums.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company’s insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income increased by $506,000, or 24.0%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.1 million in 2019. The increase in other income was primarily due to commissions from the growing wholesale agency business as well as increased fees charged on existing business.
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands).
Net losses and LAE decreased by $3.5 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The calendar year loss ratios were 62.8% and 66.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The $15.6 million of adverse development in 2020 consisted of $15.2 million from commercial lines and $352,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2018 and 2017 accident years.
The $10.6 million of adverse development in 2019 consisted of $7.6 million from commercial lines and $3.0 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2017 and 2016 accident years.
Expense Ratio
Our expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.
The table below provides the expense ratio by major component:
Our expense ratio increased by 1.6%, to 45.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.
Policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased by 2.1%, from 28.2 in 2019 to 30.3% in 2020. The acquisition cost ratio was higher mostly due to higher ceded premium rates in 2020 compared to 2019.
Operating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.3% and 15.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating expense ratio was lower due to our expense reduction efforts, partially offset by higher ceded premium rates discussed above.
Underwriting Results
We measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
Underwriting Gain (Loss)
Investment Income
Net investment income decreased by $875,000, or 21.7%, to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income in our debt securities. This occurred because of the decreasing yields driven by the decrease in prevailing market interest rates. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $176.5 million compared to $154.9 million for the same period in 2019. The averaged invested asset balance was comprised 80.2% debt securities, 7.1% equity securities and 12.7% short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. The average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments as of December 31, 2019.
The portfolio’s average quality was AA+ and AA at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 1.6% and 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.6 years and 2.8 years at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.
Realized Investment Gains
Net realized investment gains increased by $6.9 million, or 579%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributed to the company harvesting gains from the increase in value of its bond portfolio in 2020. The Company also experienced gains in its equity securities with the market increasing in value during the second half of 2020. Some of these equity gains were realized upon sale.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We issued $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the "Notes") in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market in 2020. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the Subordinated Notes is $51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the Subordinated Notes.
The Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2020, and which contributed to interest expense.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported $6,000 of current federal income tax expense and $0 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $0 and $940,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains. No such impact occurred in 2020. The Company in 2020 had $808,000 of taxable income, which was fully offset by the utilization of the net operating losses carried forward from previous years.
There is a $13.3 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020, which would increase book value by $1.37 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $13.6 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $59.2 million, of which $49.3 million expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.1 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2040.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Funds
At December 31, 2021, we had $32.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and other income. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities balances will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.
We conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the Parent Company. Secondarily, the Parent Company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the Parent Company. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. No dividends were paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
We contributed $11.4 million, $1.2 million, and $3.9 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.
We are aware that our outstanding debt securities are currently trading at a discount to their face amount. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common stock, or for a combination of cash and common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. The amounts involved in such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.4 million, compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2020. The $2.4 million increase was primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums. This increase was offset by a $6.6 million increase in paid claims, a $2.7 million increase in acquisition costs paid, and a $1.4 million decrease in investment income received.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.0 million, compared to $15.4 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in paid claims, a decrease of $3.0 million of cash received from agencies, and a $2.1 million decrease in cash received under certain fronting arrangements. These reductions in cash flow provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums.
Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.4 million. Cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million in 2020. The $8.7 million increase in cash provided by investing activities over the prior year was driven by a reduction in the purchases of investments in 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. There was a significant repositioning of the Company’s portfolio during the year ended 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused an increase in the purchase of investments.
Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $7.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively. The $17.7M increase in the use of cash from investing activities over the prior year is due to increased activity across the Company's investment portfolio to take advantage of 2020 market conditions.
Financing Activities. Cash used by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, was $5.0 million compared to $5.1 million of cash provided by financing activities for years ended December 31, 2020. The $10.1 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to the Company paying down $8.0 million on its line of credit during 2021. The Company’s borrowings under debt arrangements were also $2.7 million less in 2021 compared to 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $5.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The decrease of $1.2 million in 2020 of cash provided by financing activities was due to no issuance of common stock in 2020, and $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019. This decrease was offset by an increase in borrowings from the Company’s line of credit.
Outstanding Debt
On April 24, 2020, the Company received a $2.7 million PPP loan from the line of credit Lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act administered by the SBA. The Company received notice from the SBA that the loan was 100% forgiven, including accrued interest, on July 8, 2021. This resulted in a $2.8 million gain that is included in Other Gains on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
In 2018, the Company issued $25.3 million of Notes. The Notes bear an interest rate of 6.75% annum, payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December and mature on September 30, 2023. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company did not repurchase any of the Notes during 2021. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market during 2020 with a face value of $919,000. The Notes were repurchased at a discount to face value, which resulted in a $260,000 gain on extinguishment in 2020. This gain is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Other gains.
The Company also has outstanding $10.5 million of Subordinated Notes maturing on September 30, 2038. The Subordinated Notes bear an interest rate of 7.5% per annum until September 30, 2023, and 12.5% thereafter, and allow for four quarterly interest payment deferrals. Interest is payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December. Beginning September 30, 2021, the Company may redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, for a call premium of $1.1 million. The call premium escalates each quarter to ultimately $1.75 million on September 30, 2023, then steps up to $3.05 million on December 31, 2023, and increases quarterly at a 12.5% per annum rate thereafter.
The carrying value of the Notes and Subordinated Notes are offset by $1.3 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the loans. Refer to Note 8 ~ Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.
The Company maintains a $10.0 million line of credit with a national bank (the “Lender”). The line of credit bears interest at the London Interbank rate ("LIBOR") plus 2.75% per annum, payable monthly. The agreement includes several financial debt covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio, and minimum statutory risk-based capital levels. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding balance on the line of credit and was in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns. However, future payments may be different than historical payment patterns.
(2)
Includes estimated future payments under the software license agreement relating to our policy issuance system. This agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $30,000, and is variable with premium volume. The future payment assumptions are based on the minimum monthly payments. The software license agreement expires on November 1, 2026.
Regulatory and Rating Issues
The NAIC has a RBC formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company’s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company’s RBC declines.
At December 31, 2021, all of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.
Insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2021, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 2.2 to 1.0 and 1.6 to 1.0, respectively.
The NAIC’s IRIS was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.
