Year over year increases to general and administrative costs were directly related to an increase in operations and increased staffing and associated costs as we relocated to a larger facility and continued to expand our staff and operation in 2021 in order to position ourselves for the reopening of venues and services with the decline of the impact of COVID 19 towards the end of fiscal 2021.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided cash of $2,201,084 (December 31, 2020- $130,843), which was comprised of proceeds from private placements of $100,000 (December 31, 2020), subscriptions receivable of $150,000 (December 31, 2020 - nil), proceeds from convertible notes of $2,108,000 (December 31, 2020 - nil) offset by repayment of debt of $151,854 (December 31, 2020 - nil) and repayments of loans payable of $5,062 (December 31, 2020 - nil). During December 31, 2020 there were advances of $50,000 loans payable proceeds of $89,450, and repayments of convertible debts of $8,607 with no comparable amounts during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has been in the start-up phase and has generated modest revenues from its operations, and while we have various contracts in place for future development, there is no assurance of future revenues. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $6,212,204 with approximately $760,000 of cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of $16,092,531. In December 2020, the Company signed a convertible promissory note with a third party to provide an aggregate amount of $450,000 in $25,000 increments weekly, which was sufficient to meet operational needs and has been funded in full. During the year ended December 31, 2021, this note was amended to include an additional $1,000,000 in funding, payable over 90 business days commencing April 16, 2021, of which an amount of $600,000 has been received against the $1,000,000 funding as of December 31, 2021. Further prior to December 31, 2021, the Company has received an additional $1,108,000 in funding with respect to net proceeds of $1,008,000 from certain convertible notes and $100,000 in proceeds with respect to the sale of certain registered shares issued in consideration for put notices under an equity line entered into in fiscal 2021. The Company anticipates a need for a further $5,000,000 in fiscal 2022 to meet its upgraded infrastructure requirements and has filed two registration statements on Form S-1 to facilitate this requirement, one of which was deemed effective on September 24, 2021, and the other still pending notice of effect. The issuance of additional securities may result in significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining loans, assuming these loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations or that additional financing will be available for use when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.
Covid-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic could have a continuing adverse impact on our existing sponsorship and revenue agreements. During 2021 the implementation of services under certain of our installation agreements experienced delays as a result of the pandemic. COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which may also continue to impact our ability to raise additional capital. During March 2020, we gave notice of furlough to our administrative support employees in an effort to conserve resources as we evaluate our business development efforts in the coming months. In April 2020, the Company received a grant of $6,000 and in May 2020 we received a PPP loan and an SBA loan in the approximate cumulative amount of $90,000 for operations. During early 2022 the Company reopened its offices and continued with the hiring of additional staff as well as the upgrading of infrastructure requirements to meet anticipated customer requirements for 2022. While recent progress in the battle against COVID leads us to believe that the worst of the effects of the pandemic are past, we cannot say with certainty that the situation will not change. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report, is highly uncertain and still subject to change. While significant uncertainty remains, despite the fact that the Company has been able to source financing, it remains that the COVID-19 outbreak may have a negative impact on its ability to work through its collaborative development efforts with industry partners, and in acquiring venues due to the continuing impact of COVID 19, in particular as a result of the impact to the global supply chain.
Going Concern
These audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $6,212,204 with approximately $760,000 of cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of $16,092,531. In December 2020, the Company signed a convertible promissory note with a third party to provide an aggregate amount of $450,000 in $25,000 increments weekly, which was sufficient to meet operational needs and has been funded in full. During the year ended December 31, 2021, this note was amended to include an additional $1,000,000 in funding, payable over 90 business days commencing April 16, 2021, of which an amount of $600,000 has been received against the $1,000,000 funding as of December 31, 2021. Further prior to December 31, 2021, the Company has received an additional $1,108,000 in funding with respect to net proceeds of $1,008,000 from certain convertible notes and $100,000 in proceeds with respect to the sale of certain registered shares issued in consideration for put notices under an equity line entered into in fiscal 2021. The Company anticipates a need for a further $5,000,000 in fiscal 2022 to meet its upgraded infrastructure requirements and has filed two registration statements on Form S-1 to facilitate this requirement, one of which was deemed effective on September 24, 2021, and the other still pending notice of effect. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to raise additional equity and/or debt financing and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company’s future business. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital as needed, the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements.
Research and Development Costs
We charge research and development costs to operations as incurred in accordance with ASC 730-Research and Development, except in those cases in which such costs are reimbursable under customer funded contracts. These amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses in each of the respective periods but are included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales in each of the respective periods.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based transactions in which the Company receives services from employees, directors or others in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the grant date in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation-Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options or warrants is estimated at the grant date based on each instrument’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the award.
Stock Settled Debt
In certain instances, the Company will issue convertible notes which contain a provision in which the price of the conversion feature is priced at a fixed discount to the trading price of the Company’s common shares as traded in the over-the-counter market. In these instances, the Company records a liability, in addition to the principal amount of the convertible note, as stock-settled debt for the fixed value transferred to the convertible note holder from the fixed discount conversion feature. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Company had recorded within Convertible Notes, net of discount, the amount of $8,320,525 and $164,104 for the value of the stock settled debt for certain convertible notes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 to simplify the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. The update also provides for expanded disclosure requirements to increase transparency. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein.
