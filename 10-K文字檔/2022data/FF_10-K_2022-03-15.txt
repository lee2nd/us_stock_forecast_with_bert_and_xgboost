Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements, including the Notes thereto, set forth herein.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” below for additional discussion regarding risks associated with forward-looking statements.
Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts are in thousands.
Overview
In General
Our company is managed and reported in two reporting segments: chemicals segment and biofuels segment. Within the chemicals segment are two product groups: custom chemicals and performance chemicals. The custom chemicals group is comprised of chemicals manufactured for a single customer, whereas the performance chemicals product group is comprised of chemicals manufactured for multiple customers. The biofuels segment is comprised of one product group. Management believes that the diversity of each segment strengthens the company by better using resources and is committed to growing each segment.
Major products in the custom chemicals group include: (i) consumer products (cosmetics and personal care products, specialty polymers, and specialty products used in the fuels industry); (ii) chlorinated polyolefin adhesion promoters and antioxidant precursors for a customer; and (iii) a biocide intermediate for another customer.
The custom chemicals group historically included a laundry detergent additive manufactured exclusively for a customer for use in a household detergent. Revenues generated from the laundry detergent additive were based on a supply agreement with the customer which ended in 2020 and no further sales of such products are expected. In addition, our supply agreement with a major multi-national life sciences company to manufacture an intermediate for a herbicide was not extended past 2020 and no further sales are anticipated.
Pricing for the other custom manufacturing products is negotiated directly with the customer. Some, but not all, of these products have pricing mechanisms and/or protections against raw material or conversion cost changes.
Performance chemicals consist of specialty chemicals that are manufactured to general market-determined specifications and are sold to a broad customer base. A major product line in the performance chemicals group is SSIPA/LiSIPA, a polymer modifier that aids the properties of nylon and polyesters. This group of products also includes other sulfonated monomers and hydrotropes, specialty solvents, polymer additives, and chemical intermediates, such as glycerin.
SSIPA/LiSIPA revenues are generated from a diverse customer base of nylon fiber manufacturers and other customers that produce condensation polymers. Contract sales are, in certain instances, indexed to key raw materials for inflation; otherwise, there is no pricing mechanism or specific protection against raw material or conversion cost changes.
Pricing for the other performance chemical products is established based upon competitive market conditions. Some, but not all, of these products have pricing mechanisms and/or specific protections against raw material or conversion cost changes.
For our biofuels segment, we procure all of our own feedstock and only sell biodiesel for our own account. We have the capability to process multiple types of feedstock including vegetable oils, animal fats, and separated food waste oils. We can receive feedstock by rail or truck, and we have substantial storage capacity to acquire feedstock at advantaged prices when market conditions permit. Our annual biodiesel production capacity is in excess of 58 million gallons per year.
There currently is uncertainty as to whether we will produce biodiesel in the future. This uncertainty results from changes in feedstock prices relative to biodiesel prices and the lack of permanency of government mandates including the blenders’ tax credit, the small producer’s tax credit, the renewable fuels program, and the California low carbon fuel program credits. See “Risk Factors” above as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. This uncertainty also results from government mandates that strengthen markets that we compete against including renewable diesel and electric vehicles.
While biodiesel is the principal component of the biofuels segment, we also generate revenue from the sale of petrodiesel both in blends with our biodiesel and, from time to time, with no biodiesel added. Petrodiesel and biodiesel blends are available to customers at our leased storage facility in North Little Rock, Arkansas and at our Batesville plant. In addition, we deliver blended product to a small group of customers within our region. We also sell D4 RINs from time to time. At December 31, 2021, we had 1.8 million D4 RINs in inventory. Lastly, we also sell refined petroleum products on common carrier pipelines in part to maintain our status as an active shipper on these pipelines.
Most of our sales are FOB the Batesville plant, although some transfer points are in other states or foreign ports. While many of our chemicals are used to manufacture products that are shipped, further processed, and/or consumed throughout the world, the chemical products, with limited exceptions, generally leave the United States only after we have transferred ownership. Rarely are we the exporter of record, never are we the importer of record into foreign countries, and we are not always aware of the exact quantities of our products that are moved into foreign markets by our customers. We do track the addresses of our customers for invoicing purposes and use this address to determine whether a particular sale is within or outside the United States. Our revenue for the last three fiscal years attributable to the United States and foreign countries (based upon the billing addresses of our customers) is set forth in the following table.
The majority of our expenses are cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes raw material costs as well as both fixed and variable conversion costs, such conversion costs being those expenses that are directly or indirectly related to the operation of our plant. Significant conversion costs include labor, benefits, energy, supplies, depreciation, and maintenance and repair. In addition to raw material and conversion costs, cost of goods sold includes environmental reserves and costs related to idle capacity. Finally, cost of goods sold includes hedging gains and losses recognized by us related to our biofuels segment. Cost of goods sold is allocated to the chemicals and biofuels business segments based on equipment and resource usage for most conversion costs and based on revenue for most other costs.
Operating costs include selling, general and administrative, and research and development expenses.
The discussion of results of operations that follows is based on revenue and expenses in total and for individual product lines and does not differentiate related party transactions.
Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2020
Set forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated.
(Dollars in thousands other than per share amounts)
We use adjusted EBITDA as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities (each as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses, excluding, when applicable, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, public offering expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, losses on disposal of property and equipment, gains or losses on derivative instruments, and other non-operating income or expenses. Information relating to adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of our business. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies; therefore, the results of our calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA allows our chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of our business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of our operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, to fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends. In particular, our management believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance and liquidity, relative to a performance and liquidity based on GAAP results, while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization, which may vary among our operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance, and of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among similar companies, and gains and losses on derivative instruments, which can cause net income to appear volatile from period to period relative to the sale of the underlying physical product.
We enter into commodity derivative instruments to protect our operations from downward movements in commodity prices, and to provide greater certainty of cash flows associated with sales of our commodities. We enter into hedges, and we use mark-to-market accounting to account for these instruments. Thus, our results in any given period can be impacted, and sometimes significantly, by changes in market prices relative to our contract price along with the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel. We include this item as an adjustment as we believe it provides a relevant indicator of the underlying performance of our business in a given period.
The following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA with net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Results of Operations
Consolidated
2021 Compared to 2020
Consolidated sales revenue increased 57.2% or $116,881 in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase primarily resulted from higher average sales prices in the biofuel segment reduced in part by lower sales volumes in both the biofuels and chemicals segment.
Gross profit decreased 24.8% or $7,770 in 2021 compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to exorbitant natural gas prices incurred in February from Winter Storm Uri and the absence of two chemical contracts which expired in 2020. Partially improving gross profit in the same comparative period was higher margins on biodiesel inclusive of the change the realized and unrealized activity of derivative instruments which resulted in a reduction in gross profit in 2021 by $10,377, as compared to an increase in gross profit of $4,379 in 2020.
Operating expenses increased $1,671 in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was primarily the result of an impairment of intangible assets in 2021 (See Note 10 of our consolidated financials for details) and higher research and development expense primarily for the benefit of GMP.
Other income decreased $6,407 in 2021 primarily from non-operating income recognized in 2020 of $8,350. Partially improving other income was the absence of realized and unrealized losses on equity securities in 2021 as compared to 2020 (see Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements).
Income tax benefit (provision)
The income tax benefit in 2021 was $10,325 or an effective tax rate of (64.8%) as compared to a benefit in 2020 of $14,786 or an effective tax rate of (46.5%).
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Pub.L. 116-136) (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, provides that Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 shall be treated as a carryback available to offset 100% of taxable income in each of the 5 preceding taxable years unless the taxpayer elects to forego the carryback. The Company’s effective tax rate for the year 2020 was positively impacted by its ability to carry back both its 2019 and 2020 federal NOLs in full to tax years with 35% marginal tax rates, rather than forward to years with anticipated 21% tax rates. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company filed a refund claim of $7,695 and accrued an additional refund claim of $1,211, subsequently filed in January 2021, relating to the carryback of its NOL generated in 2019. Refunds in the amount of $7,695 were subsequently received in 2021; the $1,211 remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company filed a refund claim of $8,463 relating to the carryback of its NOL generated in 2020. None of these refunds have been received as of December 31, 2021. States in which the Company conducts the majority of its business have not conformed to the CARES Act’s enhanced NOL carryback provisions, and the anticipated benefits of these state NOL carryforwards are accordingly classified as deferred tax assets.
The Company’s effective tax rates for the years 2021 and 2020 reflect the positive effect of certain tax credits and incentives, the most significant of which are the BTC and the Small Agri-biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. Based on technical guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, the Company excludes the portion of the BTC not used to satisfy excise tax liabilities from income. See Note 3 for a discussion of the pretax earnings impact of the BTC.
The Company’s unrecognized tax benefit totaled $0 at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
2020 Compared to 2019
Consolidated sales revenue decreased $721 in 2020 compared to 2019. This net decrease primarily resulted from lower sales volumes in the chemical segment mostly offset by increased sales volumes in the biofuel segment.
Gross profit decreased $42,832 in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a benefit in the prior year from the reinstatement of the biodiesel BTC for 2018 recognized in 2019, amounting to $31,301, (see Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements for further details), lower margins on biodiesel sold, the absence of a chemical contract that expired in 2019, and reduced chemical sales volumes primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic effect on energy, textile, and automobile markets that we sell to. Partially offsetting these declines was an improvement in the change in the derivative activity which increased gross profit $4,379 in 2020 as compared to decrease in gross profit of $1,301 in 2019.
Operating expenses decreased $138 in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation expense.
Other income decreased $5,047 in 2020 primarily from the change in gain (loss) on marketable securities of $8,994 and a reduction in interest and dividend income of $4,402. In 2020, the loss on equity securities sold was $4,129 as compared to a loss of $1,837 in 2019. The mark-to-market change on equity investments was a loss of $246 in 2020 and a gain of $6,283 in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by other non-operating income of $8,350 (see Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements).
Income tax benefit (provision)
The income tax benefit in 2020 was $14,786 or an effective tax rate of (46.5%) as compared to a benefit in 2019 of $8,386 or an effective tax rate of (10.5%).
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Pub.L. 116-136) (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, provides that Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 shall be treated as a carryback available to offset 100% of taxable income in each of the 5 preceding taxable years unless the taxpayer elects to forego the carryback. The Company’s effective tax rate for the year 2020 was positively impacted by its ability to carry back both its 2019 and 2020 federal NOLs in full to tax years with 35% marginal tax rates, rather than forward to years with anticipated 21% tax rates. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company filed a refund claim of $7,695 and accrued an additional refund claim of $1,211, subsequently filed in January 2021, relating to the carryback of its NOL generated in 2019. No refunds have been received as of December 31, 2020. The Company also anticipates filing a refund claim before the end of 2021 relating to the carryback of the NOL anticipated to be generated in 2020. States in which the Company conducts the majority of its business have not conformed to the CARES Act’s enhanced NOL carryback provisions, and the anticipated benefits of these state NOL carryforwards are accordingly classified as deferred tax assets.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year 2020 reflected the positive effect of certain tax credits and incentives, the most significant of which were the BTC and the Small Agri-biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. Based on technical guidance from Internal Revenue Service, the Company excludes the portion of the BTC not used to satisfy excise tax liabilities from income.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year 2019 reflected the positive effect of the reinstatement of certain tax credits and incentives for 2018 and 2019, the most significant of which was the BTC and Small Agri-biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. The BTC and the Small Agri-biodiesel Producer Tax Credit were retroactively extended for 2018 and 2019 on December 20, 2019 and further extended through December 31, 2022. This tax benefit was recorded in the Company’s fourth quarter 2019 results. See Note 3 for a discussion of the impact of the BTC for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The 2019 effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the Company being granted a retroactive research and development credit for a prior year in the state of Arkansas where it does significant business. Additionally, the Company’s 2019 effective tax rate reflected a one-time benefit from state legislation enacted during the year which applied a lower tax rate to future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
The Company’s unrecognized tax benefit totaled $0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Chemicals Segment
2021 Compared to 2020
Chemical sales revenue decreased 14.7% or $11,636 in 2021 compared with 2020. Sales revenue for our custom chemicals product line (chemicals produced for specific customers) totaled $50,675, a decrease of 20.7% or $13,219 from 2020. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of two products we no longer sell partially offset by increased volumes of other custom chemicals. Performance chemicals revenue (comprised of multi-customer products which are sold based on specification) was $16,867 in 2021, an increase of 10.4% or $1,583 from 2020. This increase resulted from higher selling prices of our glycerin products.
Gross profit for the chemicals segment decreased 45.3% or $11,548 in 2021 compared with 2020. This decrease resulted primarily from: (i) the loss of two custom chemical products we no longer sell; (ii) the impact of higher natural gas prices incurred during Winter Storm Uri in February 2021; and (iii) increased material cost driven by inflation and the supply chain disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to it.
2020 Compared to 2019
Chemical sales revenue decreased 24.5% or $25,649 in 2020 compared with 2019. Sales revenue for our custom chemical product line (chemicals produced for specific customers) totaled $63,894, a decrease of $27,068 from 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by: i) an agrochemical product we no longer manufacture of $15,256; ii) a slowdown in near-term business in both automotive and energy related applications resulting from COVID-19 of approximately $8,000; and iii) the phase out of a laundry detergent additive of $6,886. Partially offsetting these declines was the contract revenue of $2,896 upon the termination of a custom chemical contract which expired (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements). Performance chemicals revenue (comprised of multi-customer products which are sold based on specification) was $15,284 in 2020, an increase of $1,419 from 2019. This increase resulted from higher sales volumes of our glycerin and was partially offset by reduced sales volumes of our polymer modifier, primarily from COVID-19 weakened effects in the carpet industry.
Gross profit for the chemicals segment decreased 14.7% or $4,405 in 2020 compared with 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from volume effects resulting from COVID-19 in the automotive, energy, textile applications and the absence of an herbicide intermediate product we no longer make. Partially offsetting the decrease was the benefit of the recognition of contract revenue of $2,896 upon the termination of a custom contract that was not renewed 12/31/2020.
Biofuel Segment
2021 Compared to 2020
Biofuels sales revenue increased 102.5% or $128,517 in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily from increased selling prices of biodiesel and biodiesel blends, inclusive of separated RIN sales. Sales revenue declined in part on lower sales volumes as a result of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 with its after effects in bringing the plant back to normal operations.
A portion of our biodiesel sold was to three major refiners in the United States in 2021 as compared with one major refiner in 2020. No assurances can be given that we will continue to sell to such major refiners, or, if we do sell, the volume we will sell or the profit margin we will realize. We do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole in that: (i) unlike our custom manufacturing products, biodiesel is a commodity with a large potential customer base; (ii) we believe that we could readily sell our biodiesel to other customers as potential demand from other customers for biodiesel exceeds our production capacity; (iii) our sales to this customer are not under fixed terms and the customer has no fixed obligation to purchase any minimum quantities except as stipulated by short term purchase orders; and (iv) the prices we receive from this customer are based upon then-market rates, as would be the case with sales of this commodity to other customers.
Biofuels gross profit increased 65.3% or $3,778 in 2021 compared to 2020. Gross profit primarily increased due to improved profit margins experienced in the petroleum and renewable industry. The comparative margins in 2020 were weakened from COVID-19 effects on the transportation market. Partially reducing gross profit in 2021 was the change in the realized and unrealized activity of derivative instruments in comparison to the prior year with a loss of $10,377 as compared to a gain of $4,379 in 2020.
2020 Compared to 2019
Biofuels sales revenue increased $24,928 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily from increased sales volumes of biodiesel and biodiesel blends. Sales volumes improved on greater availability of feedstocks with the BTC in law during 2020. Revenue was also improved by the reduction of rebates to customers (shown as a price effect) of $2,017 in 2020 as compared to $39,423 in 2019 (see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for further information).
A portion of our biodiesel sold was to one major refiner in the United States in 2020 and 2019. No assurances can be given that we will continue to sell to such major refiners, or, if we do sell, the volume we will sell or the profit margin we will realize. We do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole in that: (i) unlike our custom manufacturing products, biodiesel is a commodity with a large potential customer base; (ii) we believe that we could readily sell our biodiesel to other customers as potential demand from other customers for biodiesel exceeds our production capacity; (iii) our sales to this customer are not under fixed terms and the customer has no fixed obligation to purchase any minimum quantities except as stipulated by short term purchase orders; and (iv) the prices we receive from this customer are based upon then-market rates, as would be the case with sales of this commodity to other customers.
Biofuels gross profit decreased $38,427 in 2020 compared to 2019. Gross profit compared to 2019 primarily decreased due to the recognition of the 2018 BTC for $31,301 which was retroactively reinstated on December 20, 2019. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. Gross profit was also unfavorably impacted by lower margins from COVID-19 weakened effects on the transportation market in 2020 as compared to 2019. Partially benefiting gross profit in 2020 was the change in the realized and unrealized activity of derivative instruments in comparison to the prior year with a gain of $4,379 as compared to a loss of $1,301 in 2019.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We reduce our accounts receivable by amounts that may be uncollectible in the future. This estimated allowance is based upon management’s evaluation of the collectability of individual invoices and is based upon management’s evaluation of the financial condition of our customers and historical bad debt experience. This estimate is subject to change based upon the changing financial condition of our customers. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $67 and $63, respectively. We historically have not experienced significant problems in collecting our receivables, and we do not expect this to change going forward.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided for using the straight-line method over the associated assets’ estimated useful lives. We primarily base our estimate of an asset’s useful life on our experience with other similar assets. The actual useful life of an asset may differ significantly from our estimate for such reasons as the asset’s build quality, the manner in which the asset is used, or changes in the business climate. We monitor the estimated useful lives of our assets.
Indefinite-lived intangible asset
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company performs annual impairment tests of the intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and assesses qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. The Company’s qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, legal and regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, financial performance, and any other relevant events or circumstances specific to the intangible asset. During 2021, it was determined that the intangible asset had no value and was reduced to $0.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We establish reserves for closure/post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets we maintain. Environmental assets include waste management units, such as a chemical waste destructor, storage tanks, and boilers. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on an expected life of the environmental assets, the applicable regulatory closure requirements, and our environmental policies and practices. These expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. The future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site are based upon estimated current costs for such activities adjusted for anticipated future inflation rates. Unanticipated changes in either of these two variables or changes in the anticipated timing of closure/post-closure activities may significantly affect the established reserves. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we recorded a reserve for closure/post-closure liabilities of $1,363 and $1,331, respectively. We monitor this reserve and the assumptions used in its calculation. As deemed necessary, we have made changes to this reserve balance and anticipate that future changes will occur.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when performance obligations of the customer contract are satisfied. We sell to customers through master sales agreements or standalone purchase orders. The majority of our revenue is from short-term contracts with revenue recognized when a single performance obligation to transfer product under the terms of a contract with a customer is satisfied. Accordingly, we recognize revenue when control is transferred to the customer, which is when products are considered to meet customer specification per the customer contract and title and risk of loss are transferred. This typically occurs at the time of shipment or delivery; or for certain contracts, this occurs upon delivery of the material to one of our storage locations, ready for customer pickup and separated from our other inventory. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated price. We sell products directly to customers generally under agreements with payment terms of 30 to 75 days for chemical segment customers and 2 to 10 days for biofuels segment customers.
Certain long-term contracts have an upfront non-refundable payment considered a material right. The Company applies the renewal option approach in allocating the transaction price to the material right. For each of these contracts, the Company estimated the expected contractual volumes to be sold at the most likely expected sales price as a basis for allocating the transaction price to the material right. Each estimate is updated quarterly on a prospective basis. These custom chemical contracts have payment terms of 30 days. See Notes 2 and 4 of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
For most product sales, revenue is recognized when product is shipped from our facilities and when control has transferred to the customer, which is in accordance with our customer contracts and the stated shipping terms. Nearly all custom manufactured products are manufactured under written master service agreements. Performance chemicals and biodiesel are generally sold pursuant to the terms of written purchase orders. In general, customers do not have any rights of return, except for quality disputes. All of our products are tested for quality before shipment, and historically returns have been inconsequential. We do not offer rebates, except those related to the BTC.
Biodiesel selling prices can at times fluctuate based on the timing of unsold, internally generated RINs. From time to time, sales of biodiesel are on a “RINs-free” basis. Such method of selling results in applicable RINs being held. The value of RINs is not reflected in revenue until such time as the RINs sale has been completed with the transfer of the RINs.
Revenue from bill-and-hold transactions in which a performance obligation exists is recognized when the total performance obligation has been met and control of the product has transferred. Bill-and-hold transactions for 2021 and 2020 were related to custom chemicals customers whereby revenue was recognized in accordance with contractual agreements based upon product being produced and ready for use by the customer. These sales were subject to written monthly purchase orders with agreement that production was reasonable. The product was custom manufactured and stored at the customer’s request and could not be sold to another buyer. Credit and payment terms for bill-and-hold customers are similar to other custom chemicals customers. Sales revenue under bill-and-hold arrangements were $34,655, $32,779, and $51,700 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $3,154 and $2,628, respectively, was included in revenue for products that had not shipped. The latter amounts do not include Contract Assets of $362 and $808 that have not been billed nor shipped at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on a net basis within cost of goods sold. Shipping and handling fees related to sales transactions were billed to customers and recorded as sales revenue.
Income Taxes
The provision for (benefit from) income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
The Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are set forth in the following table.
(Dollars in thousands)
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2021 to $44,084 from $96,403 in 2020, a net decrease of $52,319. This decrease was attributed to the change in accounts receivable, including accounts receivable - related parties, of $98,602. The BTC increased cash from accounts receivable in 2020 by $97,295. Additionally, net income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 by $20,309.

Capital Expenditure Commitments
We had $752 of infrastructure capital repair projects that generated commitments as of December 31, 2021.
Historically, we finance capital requirements for our business with cash flows from operations and have not had the need to incur bank indebtedness to finance any of our operations during the periods discussed herein.
Credit Facility
On March 30, 2020, FutureFuel, with FutureFuel Chemical as the borrower and certain of FutureFuel’s other subsidiaries as guarantors, amended and restated its credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) originally entered into on April 16, 2015 (as amended, the “Prior Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party, Regions Bank as administrative agent and collateral agent, and PNC Bank, N.A., as syndication agent. The Credit Agreement consists of a five-year revolving credit facility in a dollar amount of up to $100,000, which includes a sublimit of $30,000 for letters of credit and $15,000 for swingline loans (collectively, the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility expires on March 30, 2025. The primary amendments from the Prior Credit Agreement were a reduction in the facility’s credit limit by $65,000, a reduction in the facility’s applicable interest rate by 0.25%, a reduction in the commitment fee, and elimination of the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.
We will be permitted to use net proceeds of any borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes. No borrowings were made under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our Credit Agreement.
The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including negative covenants that limit or restrict, among other things, indebtedness, liens and encumbrances, dividends, burdensome agreements, mergers and fundamental changes, assets sales, investments, transactions with affiliates, changes in fiscal years, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.
The interest rate floats at the following margins over LIBOR (see Note 2 to our financial statements regarding rate reform) or base rate based upon our leverage ratio. The material financial covenants, ratios, or tests contained in the Credit Facility are i) a consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.0; and ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.0.
We do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact on our credit facility or any new agreement we might enter into.
Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into guarantees of payment on behalf of the Company for amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. In addition, we and certain subsidiaries have entered into a pledge and security agreement with the bank to secure the obligations under the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the pledge and security agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries have pledged certain collateral, including but not limited to, interests in intellectual property rights and certain equity interests in our subsidiaries.
We intend to fund future capital requirements for our businesses from cash flow generated by us as well as from existing cash, cash investments, and, if the need should arise, borrowings under our credit facility. We do not believe there will be a need to issue any securities to fund such capital requirements.
Dividends
In 2021, we paid regular cash dividends aggregating $0.24 per share on our common stock with record dates and payment dates as previously discussed. The regular cash dividends totaled $10,498. On May 10, 2021, we also declared a special cash dividend of $2.50 per share on our common stock. This special cash dividend paid on June 4, 2021, amounted to $109,408. Total cash dividends paid in 2021 were $119,906.

Capital Management
As a result of positive operating results, we accumulated excess working capital. We intend to retain the remaining cash to fund infrastructure and capacity expansion at our Batesville plant or to otherwise fund our future growth. Third parties have not placed significant restrictions on our working capital management decisions.
A significant portion of these funds were held in cash or cash equivalents at multiple financial institutions. In 2021, we also had investments in certain preferred stock and other equity instruments measured at fair value and changes in fair value recognized in net income. We also hold certain trust preferred securities. We classify these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and designate them as being “available-for-sale”. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of stockholders’ equity. The fair value of these preferred stock, trust preferred securities, and other equity instruments, including accrued dividends and interest, totaled $47,190 and $64,404 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The unrealized losses on equity securities were $904 and $246 for December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Lastly, we maintain depository accounts such as checking accounts, money market accounts, and other similar accounts at selected financial institutions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We engage in two types of hedging transactions. First, we hedge our biofuels sales through the purchase and sale of futures contracts and options on futures contracts of energy commodities. This activity was captured on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Second, we hedge our biofuels feedstock through the execution of purchase contracts and supply agreements with certain vendors which meet the normal purchase and normal sales exception of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. These hedging transactions are recognized in earnings and do not qualify as a hedge accounting treatment on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 or 2020, as they do not meet the definition of a hedge instrument as defined under GAAP. The purchase of biofuels feedstock generally involves two components: basis and price. Basis covers any refining or processing required as well as transportation. Price covers the purchases of the actual agricultural commodity. Both basis and price fluctuate over time. A supply agreement with a vendor constitutes a hedge when we have committed to a certain volume of feedstock in a future period and have fixed the basis for that volume.
Contractual Obligations
Purchase obligations include the purchase of biodiesel feedstock and various other infrastructure and capital repairs as follows:
A component of other noncurrent liabilities is a reserve for asset retirement obligations and environmental contingencies of $1,363 at December 31, 2021. We are liable for these asset retirement obligations and environmental contingencies only in certain events, primarily the closure of our Batesville, Arkansas facility. As such, we do not expect a payment related to these liabilities in the foreseeable future and therefore we have excluded this amount from the table above.
