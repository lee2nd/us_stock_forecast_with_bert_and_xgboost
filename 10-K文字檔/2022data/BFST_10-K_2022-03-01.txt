ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This discussion presents management’s analysis of our results of operations and financial condition over each of the last two most recent fiscal years. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this Report.
The following discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of Business First and its subsidiaries from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 and its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. This discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this Report, particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are based on certain assumptions that Business First believes are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth under “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this statement, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. Business First assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a registered financial holding company headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, b1BANK, a Louisiana state chartered bank, we provide a broad range of financial services tailored to meet the needs of small-to-midsized businesses and professionals. Since our inception in 2006, our priority has been and continues to be creating shareholder value through the establishment of an attractive commercial banking franchise in Louisiana and across our region. We consider our primary market to include the State of Louisiana, the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and, upon completion of the TCBI merger on March 1, 2022, Houston. We currently operate out of banking centers and loan production offices in markets across Louisiana and Texas. As of December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $4.7 billion, total loans of $3.2 billion, total deposits of $4.1 billion, and total shareholders’ equity of $433.4 million.
As a financial holding company operating through one reportable operating segment, community banking, we generate most of our revenues from interest income on loans, customer service and loan fees, and interest income from securities. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest-earning assets and expense of our liabilities through our net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets.
Changes in the market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders’ equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions, and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in our markets and across our region, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our markets.
While we continue to prioritize organic growth, we also seek to capitalize upon other opportunities as they arise. Below is a summary of recent transactions that have contributed to our growth. For additional information about these transactions, See “Note 3 - Mergers and Acquisitions” in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruptions to the global, national and regional economy. Governments, businesses, and the public are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief.
We have taken a number of actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
●
In anticipation of credit losses expected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded an additional provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which a large portion of that provision still remained within the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021;
●
In sensitivity to our customers, we have waived certain service fees, such as late fees, excessive withdrawal fees, etc. and increased daily limits on ATM withdrawals, during the year ended December 31, 2020;
●
We continue to monitor borrowers who have deferred payments under our COVID-19 Deferral Assistance Program, described in further detail below;
●
We participated in the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), as described in further detail below, including participation in round 2 of the PPP during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold approximately 2,000 PPP loans with an aggregate balance of $243.6 million at a gain of $9.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $5.4 million in SBA PPP loans remaining;
●
We continue to monitor those sectors particularly impacted by the pandemic - such as energy, hotels, restaurants, 1-4 family and retail - and have flagged those sectors for additional monitoring;
COVID-19 Deferral Assistance Program
Beginning on March 25, 2020, we have taken proactive measures to help customers impacted by COVID-19 by deferring principal and/or interest payments. As of December 31, 2021, we had deferrals remaining on 1,574 loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $522.0 million.
In accordance with FASB and interagency regulatory guidance issued in March 2020, loans that are modified under the terms of our COVID-19 Deferral Assistance Program will not be considered as troubled debt restructurings to the extent that they meet the terms of such guidance under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.
SBA PPP Participation
As of December 31, 2021, we held 32 PPP loans (including both round 1 and round 2 PPP loans) with an aggregate balance of $5.4 million and an average loan balance of $168,000. In June 2021, we sold approximately 2,000 PPP loans with an aggregate balance of $243.6 million at a gain of $9.2 million.
MSLP Participation
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we funded approximately 45 loans with an aggregate originated loan principal balance of $327.8 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had transferred/sold 95%, or $311.4 million, of the principal balance of the MSLP loans to a MSLP special purpose vehicle entity and retained $16.4 million of the outstanding principal balance. As of December 31, 2021, we retained the outstanding principal balance of $15.5 million.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Performance Summary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net income was $52.1 million, or $2.54 per basic share and $2.53 per diluted share, compared to net income of $30.0 million, or $1.65 per basic share and $1.64 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Return on average assets increased to 1.18% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.88% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Return on average equity increased to 12.25% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 8.42% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Interest Income
Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, calculated as the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Fluctuations in market interest rates impact the yield and rates paid on interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities also impact net interest income. The variance driven by the changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is referred to as a “volume change.” Changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds are referred to as a “rate change.”
To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders’ equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. We calculate average assets, liabilities, and equity using a monthly average, and average yield/rate utilizing a 30/360 day convention.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net interest income totaled $153.9 million, and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.84% and 3.65%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020 net interest income totaled $127.6 million and net interest margin and net interest spread were 4.06% and 3.77%, respectively. The average yield on the loan portfolio was 5.16%, excluding SBA PPP loans, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 5.60% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the average yield on total interest-earning assets was 4.25% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 4.76% for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, overall cost of funds (which includes noninterest-bearing deposits) decreased 31 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the federal funds rate cuts during the second half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, along with lower yielding deposits and increased deposit and borrowing accretion from the Pedestal acquisition. While we experienced significant loan growth in average loan balances, we anticipate continued pressure on our net interest margin and net interest spread in future periods based on the current yield curve.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding and the interest earned or paid on such amounts. The table also sets forth the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is not recognized in income; however the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans was not material. Any nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The average total loans reflected below is net of deferred loan fees and discounts. Acquired loans were recorded at fair value at acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining lives of the respective loans or expected cash flows. Averages presented in the table below, and throughout this report, are month-end averages.
(1) Net interest spread is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.
(2) Net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
The following table presents information regarding the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated for each major component of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and distinguishes between the changes attributable to changes in volume and changes attributable to changes in interest rates. For purposes of these tables, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated to rate.
Provision for Loan Losses
Our provision for loan losses is a charge to income in order to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management. For a description of the factors taken into account by management in determining the allowance for loan losses see “-Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan Losses.” The provision for loan losses was $8.0 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lower provision during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 relates primarily to the improvement of the qualitative factors attributed to the general economy and energy sector, offset by reserves for new loan growth.
Noninterest Income (“Other Income”)
Our primary sources of noninterest income are service charges on deposit accounts, debit card and automated teller machine (“ATM”) fee income, income from bank-owned life insurance, fees and brokerage commissions, and pass-through income from small business investment company (“SBIC”) partnerships. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income:
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $14.2 million, or 65.9%, to $35.8 million compared to noninterest income of $21.6 million for the same period in 2020. The components of noninterest income with significant fluctuations compared to the prior year period were as follows:
Service charges on deposit accounts. We earn fees from our customers for deposit-related services, and these fees constitute a significant and predictable component of our noninterest income. Service charges on deposit accounts were $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $5.4 million for the same time period in 2020, an increase of $1.5 million, or 27.2%. The increase was primarily due to increases in deposit balances and accounts from the acquisition of Pedestal and organic growth.
Debit card and ATM fee income. We earn fees from our customers based upon card activity, and these fees constitute a significant recurring component of our noninterest income. Fee income was $6.2 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of $1.9 million, or 43.5%. The increase was primarily due to the additional accounts and ATMs from the acquisition of Pedestal and organic growth.
Gain on sales of loans. We had gains on sales of loans of $10.1 million mainly due to the sale of the bulk of our SBA PPP portfolio. We sold approximately 2,000 PPP loans with an aggregate balance of $243.6 million realizing a gain of $9.2 million.
Fees and brokerage commissions. We earn commissions from brokerage services provided by our Wealth Solutions Group and SSW. Fees and brokerage commissions totaled $5.0 million and $970,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same time period in 2020, was primarily due to the acquisition of Pedestal’s brokerage customers and SSW.
Gain (loss) on sale of other real estate owned. The majority of the loss on sale of other real estate resulted from the sale of seven properties that were originally held for future expansion at a total loss of $1.1 million.
Gain on sale of banking center. We sold a banking center located in Oak Grove, Louisiana that resulted in a gain of $492,000 during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Other. This category includes a variety of other income producing activities, including wire transfer fees, mortgage-related income, insurance commissions and credit card income. Other income increased $604,000, or 30.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, is primarily due to increases in the use of these services by legacy Pedestal customers.
Noninterest Expense (“Other Expense”)
Generally, noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy expenses, depreciation and amortization, professional and regulatory fees, including Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) assessments, data processing expenses, and advertising and promotion expenses, among others.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense:
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $16.1 million, or 15.9%, to $117.1 million compared to noninterest expense of $101.0 million for the same period in 2020. The components of noninterest expense with significant fluctuations compared to the prior year period were as follows:
Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of noninterest expense and include payroll expense, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. Salaries and employee benefits were $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.4 million, or 14.7%, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to additional hires for new positions, our merit increase cycle, the acquisition of Pedestal (including severance and retention payments related to the acquisition) and its legacy operations and employees, and the acquisition of SSW. As of December 31, 2021, we had 659 full-time equivalent employees, compared to 590 full-time equivalents as of December 31, 2020. Salaries and employee benefits included stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Occupancy of bank premises. Expense associated with occupancy of premises was $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $5.3 million for the same period in 2020. The increase of $1.9 million, or 35.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, may be attributed primarily to the acquisition of Pedestal.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $5.8 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This category includes leasehold, furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation totaling $4.2 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amortization of intangible assets was $1.6 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization primarily resulted from the acquisition of Pedestal’s assets and the core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Pedestal acquisition, as well as the customer intangible recorded in connection with the SSW acquisition.
Data processing. Data processing fees were $8.1 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $2.6 million, or 47.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, is primarily due to increased costs in connection with the Pedestal acquisition.
Advertising and promotions. Advertising and promotions cost were $2.7 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $1.1 million, or 69.0%. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, is due primarily to additional advertising we engaged in during 2021.
Merger and conversion related expenses. Merger and conversion related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were related primarily to the acquisitions of Pedestal in 2020, and SSW and TCBI in 2021.
Other. This category includes various operating and administrative expenses including business development expenses (i.e. travel and entertainment, donations and club dues), insurance, supplies and printing, equipment rent, and software support and maintenance. Other noninterest expense increased $2.2 million, or 16.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.
Income Tax Expense
The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amounts of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax expense totaled $12.4 million, an increase of $5.6 million, or 83.0%, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our effective tax rates were 19.2% and 18.5%, respectively. Our income tax rate expense for both years was affected primarily by tax-exempt income generated by municipal securities, bank-owned life insurance and by other nondeductible expenses (including acquisition-related expenses). Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was also impacted by nondeductible goodwill write-offs associated with a branch sale. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was impacted by excess tax deductions from the exercise of stock options on founder grants.
Financial Condition
Our total assets increased $566.0 million, or 13.6%, from $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, due primarily from the increases in our investment and loan portfolios, offset with decreases in cash and cash equivalents.
Loan Portfolio
Our primary source of income is interest on loans to individuals, professionals and small-to-midsized businesses in our markets. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans and real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties located in our primary market areas. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our earning asset base.
As of December 31, 2021, total loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, were $3.2 billion, an increase of $198.3 million or 6.6%, compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets, offset by the sale of the majority of our SBA PPP loans. Additionally, $1.2 million and $969,000 in mortgage loans were classified as loans held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total loans held for investment as a percentage of deposits were 78.2% and 82.7% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total loans as a percentage of assets were 67.5% and 71.9% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following table summarizes our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated:
SBA PPP loans accounted for $5.4 million of the commercial portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and $313.9 million and $1.5 million of the commercial and consumer portfolios, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
Commercial loans. Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and effectively. These loans are made based primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and generally include personal guarantees.
Commercial loans decreased $164.9 million, or 18.6%, to $721.4 million as of December 31, 2021 from $886.3 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the sale of the majority of the SBA PPP portfolio, offset largely by new originations in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and New Orleans markets.
Construction and land. Construction and land development loans are comprised of loans to fund construction, land acquisition and land development construction. The properties securing the portfolio are located primarily throughout Louisiana and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, and are generally diverse in terms of type.
Construction and land loans increased $145.5 million, or 36.1%, to $548.5 million as of December 31, 2021 from $403.1 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to our Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets.
1-4 family residential. Our 1-4 family residential loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by single family homes, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned. Our 1-4 family residential loans have a relatively small average balance spread between many individual borrowers and are generally offered as accommodations to existing customers.
1-4 family residential loans decreased $951,000, or 0.2%, to $467.7 million as of December 31, 2021 from $468.7 million as of December 31, 2020.
Nonfarm nonresidential. Nonfarm nonresidential loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows and, secondarily, as loans secured by real estate. These loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the portfolio are located throughout Louisiana and Texas and are generally diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry.
Nonfarm nonresidential loans increased $172.8 million, or 17.8%, to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $971.6 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to our Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and New Orleans markets.
Other loan categories. Other categories of loans included in our loan portfolio include farmland and agricultural loans made to farmers and ranchers relating to their operations, multi-family residential loans, and consumer loans. None of these categories of loans represents a significant portion of our total loan portfolio.
The contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with fixed and floating interest rates in each maturity range as of date indicated are summarized in the following tables:

Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due, or interest may be recognized on a cash basis as long as the remaining book balance of the loan is deemed collectible. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
We have several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by our bankers, and we also monitor our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.
We believe our conservative lending approach and focused management of nonperforming assets has resulted in sound asset quality and the timely resolution of problem assets. We had $14.5 million and $20.0 million in nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had $13.1 million in nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2021 compared to $10.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in nonperforming assets from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to sale of other real estate owned.
The following tables present information regarding nonperforming loans at the dates indicated:
Through December 31, 2021, we had agreed to deferrals related to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on 1,574 loans with outstanding balances of $522.0 million by granting temporary payment deferrals of principal and/or interest. As of December 31, 2020, we had agreed to deferrals on 2,259 loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $829.1 million. We had 121 loans with outstanding principal balances of $98.1 million still in their deferral periods as of December 31, 2020, although $94.8 million were interest-only modifications to seasoned, highly rated clients. As of December 31, 2021, none of these loans are currently in their deferral period. In accordance with FASB and interagency regulatory guidance issued in March 2020, loans that are modified under the terms of our COVID-19 Deferral Assistance Program are not required to be classified as troubled debt restructurings to the extent that they meet the terms of such guidance under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. Loans under these deferrals remain in their current risk rating and/or past due status through the deferral period.
Potential Problem Loans
From a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans in one of four categories: pass, special mention, substandard or doubtful. Loans classified as loss are charged-off. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is believed to be inherent in each credit. Our methodology is structured so that specific allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk of loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk of loss).
Credits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness; however, such concerns are not so pronounced that we generally expect to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits with a lower rating.
Credits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses which exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed.
Credits rated doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those rated substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
The following tables summarize our internal ratings of our loans held for investment as of the dates indicated.
Allowance for Loan Losses
We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. For additional discussion of our methodology, please refer to “-Critical Accounting Estimates-Allowance for loan losses.”
In connection with our review of the loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include:
•
for commercial and industrial loans, the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower’s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category, and the value, nature and marketability of collateral;
•
for commercial mortgage loans and multi-family residential loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements), operating results of the owner in the case of owner occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral, and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical for properties of that type;
•
for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan to value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral; and
•
for construction, land development and other land loans, the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, the experience and ability of the developer, and the loan to value ratio.
As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan losses totaled $29.1 million, or 0.91%, of total loans held for investment. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses totaled $22.0 million, or 0.74%, of total loans held for investment.
The following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data:
(1)
Excluding loans held for sale.
Although we believe that we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP and that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. If we experience economic declines or if asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required.
The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan categories and certain other information as of the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge-offs, nor as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.
Securities
We use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate risk, meet collateral requirements, and meet regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled $1.0 billion, an increase of $380.5 million, or 59.4%, compared to $640.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to deployment of excess cash related to the SBA PPP forgiveness and portfolio sale. Securities represented 21.6% and 15.4% of total assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our investment portfolio consists entirely of securities classified as available for sale. As a result, the carrying values of our investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The following tables summarize the amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities as of the dates shown:
All of our mortgage-backed securities are agency securities. We do not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, corporate equity, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, structured investment vehicles, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, subprime, Alt-A, or second lien elements in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2021.
Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment, at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.
The following tables set forth the fair value, maturities and approximated weighted average yield based on estimated annual income divided by the average amortized cost of the securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. The contractual maturity of a mortgage-backed security is the date at which the last underlying mortgage matures.
The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities tend to cause the average life of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and, consequently, the average life of this security will be lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of this security. The weighted average life of our investment portfolio was 5.87 years with an estimated effective duration of 53.46 months as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not own securities of any one issuer for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10% of the consolidated shareholders’ equity as of such respective dates.
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company held other equity securities of $16.6 million and $12.7 million, respectively, comprised mainly of FHLB stock, SBIC’s and financial technology (“Fintech”) fund investments.
Deposits
We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits.
Total deposits as of December 31, 2021 were $4.1 billion, an increase of $460.6 million, or 12.7%, compared to $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2020.
Noninterest-bearing deposits as of December 31, 2021 were $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $126.9 million, or 10.9%.
Average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 36.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.8 billion. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits decreased over this period from 0.89% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 0.47% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average rates was driven by the federal funds rate cuts that occurred in the first quarter of 2020 and the maturing of higher yielding deposits, along with the accretion of deposit premium from the Pedestal acquisition. In addition, the stability and the continued growth of noninterest-bearing demand accounts served to reduce the cost of deposits to 0.32% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 0.63% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the daily average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated:
The ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 31.5% and 29.1%, respectively.
The following table sets forth the contractual maturities of certain certificates of deposit at December 31, 2021:
Borrowings
We utilize short-term and long-term borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investment activities. In addition, we use short-term borrowings to periodically repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock and for general corporate purposes. Each of these relationships are discussed below.
FHLB advances. The FHLB allows us to borrow on a blanket floating lien status collateralized by certain securities and loans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, total borrowing capacity of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, was available under this arrangement and $82.0 million and $43.0 million, respectively, was outstanding with a weighted average stated interest rate of 1.08% as of December 31, 2021 and 2.01% as of December 31, 2020. Our current FHLB advances mature within five years. We utilize these borrowings to meet liquidity needs and to fund certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio.
The following table presents our FHLB borrowings at the dates indicated.
Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (“Subordinated Debt”). In December 2018 we issued subordinated notes in the amount of $25.0 million. The subordinated notes bear a fixed rate of interest at 6.75% until December 31, 2028 and a floating rate thereafter through maturity in 2033. The balance outstanding at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $25.0 million. This subordinated notes were issued for the purpose of paying off our long term advance and line of credit with First National Bankers Bank (“FNBB”), for general corporate purposes and to provide Tier 2 capital. The subordinated notes are redeemable by the Company at its option beginning in 2028.
On March 26, 2021, we issued $52.5 million in subordinated notes. These subordinated notes bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% through March 31, 2026 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 354 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2031. The balance at December 31, 2021 on these notes was $52.5 million.
On April 1, 2021, we consummated the acquisition of SSW. Under the terms of the acquisition, we issued $3.9 million in subordinated debt to the former owners of SSW. This subordinated debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% through April 1, 2026 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 442 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2031. The balance at December 31, 2021 on this debt was $3.9 million.
The following table presents the Subordinated Debt at the dates indicated.
FNBB revolving advances. FNBB allowed us to borrow on a revolving basis up to $5.0 million. This line of credit, established on September 12, 2016, was secured by a pledge of and security interest in the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, b1BANK. This line of credit did not have a balance at December 31, 2019. In March 2020, we utilized the full amount of this line of $5.0 million, all of which was outstanding at December 31, 2020. This line of credit carried a variable interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime rate. This FNBB line was established for the purpose of repurchasing shares of our common stock from certain of our shareholders and for general corporate purposes. This line of credit was paid in full in March 2021.
FNBB revolving advances. FNBB allows us to borrow on a revolving basis up to $5.0 million. This line of credit, established on November 3, 2021, is secured by a pledge of and security interest in the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, b1BANK. This line of credit did not have a balance at December 31, 2021. This line of credit carried a variable interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime rate not to be less than 3.50%.
FNBB note payable. We acquired a $7.0 million note payable with FNBB from Pedestal of which $6.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020. The note was payable in annual installments of $1.0 million with a maturity date in August 2026. The note carried a variable interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime rate, with a minimum rate of 4.00%, and adjusted quarterly. Interest payments were due quarterly. This note was paid in full in March 2021.
Trust preferred securities. In the Pedestal acquisition, we assumed their obligations of $5.2 million in junior subordinated debentures, which are associated with $5.0 million in trust preferred securities issued by a trust. Interest on the junior subordinated debentures is accrued at an annual rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR, as determined in the agreement, plus 3.05%. Interest is payable quarterly. The agreement indenture governing the debentures allows us to defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods. The trust preferred securities do not have a stated maturity date, however, they are subject to mandatory redemption on September 17, 2033, or upon earlier redemption. We have guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other payments due on the trust preferred securities subject to the guarantee agreement and the indenture. Principal and interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures are in a superior position to the liquidation rights of holders of common stock.
Correspondent Bank Federal Funds Purchased Relationships
We maintain Federal Funds Purchased Relationships with the following financial institutions and limits as of December 31, 2021:
The following table represents combined Federal Funds Purchased for all relationships at the dates indicated.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Liquidity involves our ability to utilize funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, security and loan maturities, and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Although access to brokered deposits, purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight advances from the FHLB have been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, we do not generally rely on these external funding sources. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we maintained six lines of credit with commercial banks which provided for extensions of credit with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate of $154.0 million and $126.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no funds under these lines of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table illustrates, during the periods presented, the mix of our funding sources and the average assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled $4.4 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our primary source of funds is deposits, and our primary use of funds is loans. We do not expect a change in the primary source or use of our funds in the foreseeable future. Our average loans increased 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to our Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets, offset with the sale of the majority of our SBA PPP portfolio. We predominantly invest excess deposits in overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve, securities, interest-bearing deposits at other banks or other short-term liquid investments until needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio had a weighted average life of 5.87 years and an effective duration of 53.46 months as of December 31, 2021 and a weighted average life of 5.93 years and an effective duration of 45.79 months as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding $1.0 billion in commitments to extend credit and $35.3 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding $621.1 million in commitments to extend credit and $23.9 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Because commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. See “-Off Balance Sheet Items” below for additional information.
As of December 31, 2021, we had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $68.4 million compared to $149.1 million as of December 31, 2020, excluding federal funds sold.
Capital Resources
Total shareholders’ equity increased to $433.4 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $410.0 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $23.4 million, or 5.7%. This increase was primarily due to net income of $52.1 million, offset with $11.8 million in the change in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio, $9.4 million in paid dividends and $10.9 million in stock repurchases.
On January 24, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend based upon our financial performance for the three months ended December 31, 2021 in the amount of $0.12 per share to the common shareholders of record as of February 15, 2022. The dividend was paid on February 28, 2022.
The declaration and payment of dividends to our shareholders, as well as the amounts thereof, are subject to the discretion of the Board and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiary, b1BANK. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders.
Capital management consists of providing equity to support current and future operations. Banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements at the holding company and bank levels. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we and b1BANK were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and b1BANK was classified as “well-capitalized,” for purposes of prompt corrective action regulations. As we employ our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital standards applicable to us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we elected to opt in to the CBLR framework. Pursuant to section 201(b) of EGRRCPA, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a final rule in 2019 imposing a minimum community bank leverage ratio requirement of 9.0%. On April 6, 2020, as mandated under the CARES Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted an interim final rule that temporarily reduced the minimum community bank leverage ratio requirement to 8.0% and provided a two quarter grace period for banks with a leverage ratio between 7.0% and 8.0%. A transition interim final rule also adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies on April 6, 2020 provides a graduated transition from the temporary 8.0% community bank leverage ratio requirement, to the 9.0% community bank leverage ratio requirement as established under the 2019 final rule. Specifically, the transition interim final rule provides that the community bank leverage ratio will be 8.0% in the second quarter through fourth quarter of calendar year 2020, 8.5% in calendar year 2021, and 9.0% thereafter. During the first quarter of 2021, we elected to revert to the risk weighted ratios detailed below.
The following table presents the actual capital amounts and regulatory capital ratios for us and b1BANK as of the dates indicated.
Long Term Debt
For information on our subordinated debt, please refer to “Borrowings”.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (other than non-maturity deposit obligations), which consist of future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our FHLB advances, subordinated debt, revolving line of credit, note payables, and non-cancelable future operating leases. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts. Advances from the FHLB totaled approximately $82.0 million and $43.1 million (included remaining purchase premium) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the FHLB advances were collateralized by a blanket floating lien on certain securities and loans, had a weighted average stated rate of 1.08% and 2.01%, respectively, and maturing within five years. The subordinated debt totaled $81.4 million and $25.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Of this subordinated debt, $25.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% through December 31, 2028 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 369 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2033, $52.5 million of this subordinated debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% through March 31, 2026 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 354 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2031. The remaining $3.9 million of this subordinated debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% through April 1, 2026 and a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate plus 442 basis points, thereafter through maturity in 2031. The revolving line of credit with FNBB had a balance of $5.0 million at December 31, 2020 which was paid off during the first quarter 2021. We acquired a note payable to FNBB in the amount of $7.0 million, of which $6.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and was paid off during the first quarter of 2021. In November, 2021, we entered into a revolving line of credit with FNBB in the amount of $5.0 million with a variable interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime and not to be less than 3.5%. This revolving line of credit is for one year and matures in November, 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet Items
In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
Our commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of the date indicated are summarized below. Because commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event of nonperformance by the customer, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and/or marketable securities. The credit risk to us in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to our customers.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total commitment amounts disclosed above do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by us, upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.
Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk
As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We manage our sensitivity position within our established guidelines.
Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income.
We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, interest rate swaps, financial options, financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets.
Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the asset-liability committee of b1BANK, in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model.
We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. Average lives of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on standard regulatory decay assumptions and are also incorporated into the model. Model assumptions are revised and updated as more accurate information becomes available. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.
On at least a quarterly basis, we run two simulation models including a static balance sheet and dynamic growth balance sheet. These models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static and dynamic growth models, rates are shocked instantaneously based upon parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 5% for a 100 basis point shift, 10% for a 200 basis point shift, and 12.5% for a 300 basis point shift. Internal policy regarding interest rate simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated fair value of equity at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10% for a 100 basis point shift, 15% for a 200 basis point shift, and 25% for a 300 basis point shift.
The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated:
The results are primarily due to the balance sheet mix and behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. We have found that, historically, interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.
Impact of Inflation
Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this statement have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.
Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP, and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional non-GAAP financial measures. We classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.
This discussion and analysis section includes certain non-GAAP financial measures (e.g., referenced as “core” or “tangible”) intended to supplement, not substitute for, comparable GAAP measures. These measures typically adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that in management’s opinion can distort period-to-period comparisons of Business First’s performance. Transactions that are typically excluded from non-GAAP measures include realized and unrealized gains/losses on former bank premises and equipment, gain/losses on sales of securities, and acquisition-related expenses (including, but not limited to, legal costs, system conversion costs, severance and retention payments, etc.). The measures also typically adjust goodwill and intangible assets from book value and shareholders’ equity.
Management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s core business. These non-GAAP disclosures are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial metrics or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this statement when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.
Core Net Income. Core net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $53.9 million, or $2.61 per diluted share, compared to core net income of $37.5 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Core net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 included the $378,000 in gains on sale of securities and a $492,000 gain on sale of the Oak Grove Banking Center, the incurrence $1.0 million in losses attributed to former bank premises and equipment, $515,000 in acquisition-related expenses and $1.6 million in hurricane repair expenses compared to $135,000 in gains on sale of securities, the incurrence of $9.6 million in acquisition-related expenses, and 351,000 in losses attributed to former bank premises and equipment December 31, 2020.

Tangible Book Value Per Common Share. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate (1) tangible common equity as shareholders’ equity less goodwill and core deposit and customer intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and (2) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per common share is book value per common share.
The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total shareholders’ equity to tangible common equity and presents tangible book value per common share compared to book value per common share:

Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets. Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate tangible common equity, as described above, and tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, core deposit and customer intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity to tangible assets is total common shareholders’ equity to total assets.
The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total shareholders’ equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets:
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and with general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are appropriate.
Acquired Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses
Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans and, therefore, no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate any subsequently required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of losses is based on the unpaid principal balance and then compared to any remaining unaccreted purchase discount. To the extent the calculated loss is greater than the remaining unaccreted discount, an allowance is recorded for such amount. These loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by any purchase discount or allowance for loan loss, and increased by any purchase premium.
Certain acquired impaired loans, where there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments, are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 310-30 Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The expected cash flows for each loan meeting this criteria are estimated to determine the excess of the contractually required principal and interest at acquisition as an amount that should not be accreted (nonaccretable difference). The expected cash flows for the purchased impaired credits approximated fair value as of the merger date. A discount was recorded on these loans at acquisition to record them at their estimated fair values. As a result, the purchased impaired credits are excluded from the calculation of the allowance for loan losses as of the acquisition date. Under current accounting principles, if we determine that losses arose after the acquisition date, the additional losses will be reflected as a provision to the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is an estimated amount management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans that may be uncollectible based upon review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. Management’s periodic evaluation of the allowance is based on general economic conditions, the financial condition of borrowers, the value and liquidity of collateral, delinquency, prior loan loss experience, and the results of periodic reviews of the portfolio.
The allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components. The first component, the general reserve, is determined in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance that considers historical loss rates and is adjusted for qualitative factors based upon general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to us to estimate probable incurred losses. Such qualitative factors include current local economic conditions and trends including unemployment, changes in lending staff, policies and procedures, changes in credit concentrations, changes in the trends and severity of problem loans, and changes in trends in volume and terms of loans. These qualitative factors serve to compensate for additional areas of uncertainty inherent in the portfolio that are not reflected in our historical loss factors. For purposes of determining the general reserve, the loan portfolio, less cash secured loans, government guaranteed loans and impaired loans, is multiplied by our adjusted historical loss rate. The second component of the allowance for loan losses, the specific reserve, is determined in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance based on probable losses on specific impaired loans.
Due to our growth over the past several years, a portion of the loans in our portfolio and our lending relationships are of relatively recent origin. The new loan portfolios have limited delinquency and credit loss history and have not yet exhibited an observable loss trend. The credit quality of loans in these loan portfolios are impacted by delinquency status and debt service coverage generated by the borrowers’ business, and fluctuations in the value of real estate collateral. Management considers delinquency status to be the most meaningful indicator of the credit quality of 1-4 family residential, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process we refer to as “seasoning”. As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a portfolio of newer loans. Because the majority of our portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will prevail when the portfolio becomes more seasoned, which may be higher than current levels. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Delinquency statistics are updated at least monthly. Internal risk ratings are considered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for new commercial, construction, and commercial real estate loans. Internal risk ratings are a key factor in identifying loans that are individually evaluated for impairment and impact management’s estimates of loss factors used in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses. Internal risk ratings are updated on a continuous basis.
Our policy requires measurement of the allowance for an impaired collateral dependent loan based on the fair value of the collateral. Other loan impairments are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan’s observable market price.
From time to time, we modify our loan agreement with a borrower. A modified loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring when two conditions are met: (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (ii) concessions are made by us that would not otherwise be considered for a borrower with similar credit risk characteristics. Modifications to loan terms may include a lower interest rate, a reduction of principal, or a longer term to maturity. We review each troubled debt restructured loan and determine on a case by case basis if the loan is subject to impairment and the need for a specific allowance for loan loss allocation. An allowance for loan loss allocation is based on either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.
We have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income with an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis and makes changes as appropriate. Management receives frequent reports related to loan originations, quality, concentrations, delinquencies, nonperforming and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions, both by type of loan and geography.
Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and effectively. Underwriting standards are designed to determine whether the borrower possesses sound business ethics and practices and to evaluate current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and include personal guarantees.
Real estate loans are also subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans. These loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows and, secondarily, as loans secured by real estate. The repayment of real estate loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loans or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing our real estate portfolio are generally diverse in terms of type and geographic location, throughout the state of Louisiana and Texas. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry.
We utilize methodical credit standards and analysis to supplement our policies and procedures in underwriting consumer loans. Our loan policy addresses types of consumer loans that may be originated and the collateral, if secured, which must be perfected. The relatively smaller individual dollar amounts of consumer loans that are spread over numerous individual borrowers also minimize risk.
Purchase Accounting Adjustments (other than loans)
The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the Company records the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values, which generally involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, as well as internal valuations for certain instruments. Core deposit intangibles, deposit premiums, securities, properties, and borrowings are some of the more subjective instruments which are generally fair valued by the Company during acquisitions. Further, the determination of the useful lives as well as the appropriate amortization method of other intangible assets is also subjective.
