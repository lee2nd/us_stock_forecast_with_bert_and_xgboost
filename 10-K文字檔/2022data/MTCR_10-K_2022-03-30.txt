Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company currently focused on discovering and developing differentiated therapies for patients with GI diseases. Our most advanced program, MET642, targets the FXR, which is central to modulating GI and liver diseases.
Prior to February 2022, we were developing another FXR agonist, MET409, for the treatment of NASH, a liver disease characterized by excess liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis. While we believe these two compounds demonstrate potential for differentiated treatments in both monotherapy and combination treatment for NASH, given recent clinical outcomes of our programs relative to competing programs, reduced investor sentiment in NASH, and the significant resources required to pursue further development in NASH, we elected to discontinue future development of our FXR program in NASH while prioritizing our resources and efforts toward the development of MET642 for the treatment of UC, one of the two primary types of IBD. We were also developing small molecule inhibitors of HSD17β13 for the treatment of NASH. HSD17β13 is a genetically validated target for advanced liver disease. In February 2022, our Board, approved a corporate restructuring plan, or Restructuring Plan, that resulted in the reduction of approximately 50% of our workforce, primarily consisting of our research organization, which consequently resulted in the discontinued development of our HSD program.
We are pursuing development of MET642 for the treatment of UC, as we believe FXR plays a key role in the treatment of IBD, including UC. FXR is highly expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and plays a key role in healthy intestinal function by maintaining the epithelial barrier, reducing bacterial translocation into the intestinal wall and regulating the innate immune response. FXR-based therapies in IBD address multiple aspects of IBD pathogenesis without the immunosuppression inherent to other advanced-line therapies.
IBD is a significant global health issue and is thought to occur due to a maladaptive immune response to gut microbes. UC and Crohn’s disease are the two primary types of IBD. Patients with IBD can suffer from abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea and also be at increased risk of colorectal cancer. The global incidence of IBD is increasing and as of 2015, it was estimated that there were 3.1 million people in the United States with IBD. Our first clinical investigation of FXR therapy in IBD will be focused on patients with UC.
Goals in the treatment of UC are to induce and maintain remission while improving patients’ quality of life. For patients with moderate-to-severe UC, medical treatment options have limitations in terms of long-term efficacy and side effects and have complicated administration regimens. There is approximately 10% clinical remission benefit over placebo for existing medical treatment options. Injectable biologics have become a mainstay of treatment in UC patients. While these agents can be effective, long-term response to these agents is often reduced over time, in part due to the development of neutralizing antibodies. Injectable biologics are also cumbersome to administer chronically. Additionally, many of the biologic and other oral therapies for UC result in an immunosuppressive effect that can increase the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancy. Regardless of therapy, most patients with UC who are treated do not achieve clinical remission and combination therapy is generally limited by potentially additive immunosuppressive effects. Novel, effective therapies are needed for this condition, and we believe that an oral once-daily treatment for UC that does not increase the risk of infections could be a beneficial treatment for patients.
We believe an oral, once-daily therapy with FXR agonists could be an attractive treatment option for UC patients that may prefer oral administration instead of injectable biologics that are cumbersome to administer chronically. In preclinical animal studies with our current and previous FXR agonist product candidates, we have observed statistically significant improvements in colon histology and at levels similar to that of a mouse antibody which targets IL-12/23. The IL-12/23 pathway is the target of current approved biologic therapies.
We intend to initiate a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of MET642 for the treatment of UC in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to use the data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and the Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH to help inform our UC development program. The planned UC trial is a 12-week randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of MET642,
compared to placebo, over 12 weeks of treatment. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive MET642 (3 mg), MET642 (6 mg) or placebo. Each trial drug will be given once daily by oral administration. The trial will enroll up to 165 patients in the United States and in Europe. An interim analysis is planned once 50% of the patients have completed treatment in the study.
To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business, planning, raising capital, researching, discovering and developing our pipeline in FXR and other drug targets and general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of long-term debt, and the sale of common stock from our IPO and our ATM offering program. To date, we have raised gross proceeds of approximately $124.8 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $15.0 million under the K2 Loan Agreement, and $107.7 million from the sale of common stock from our IPO and our ATM offering program. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $76.4 million.
We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses were $62.2 million and $37.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $183.0 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and preclinical studies and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase as MET642 or any future product candidates, advance through clinical trials, and as we expand our clinical, regulatory, quality and manufacturing capabilities, incur significant commercialization expenses for marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution, if we obtain marketing approval for MET642 or any future product candidate, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, which will not be for many years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of MET642 or any future product candidate, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, additional borrowings under the K2 Loan Agreement, collaborations, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, reduce or terminate our development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenues
To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of any products for the foreseeable future, if ever.
Research and Development Expenses
To date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.
Research and development expenses include:
•
salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts;
•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites and consultants to conduct our preclinical, toxicology and clinical studies;
•
costs related to manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and preclinical studies, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers;
•
laboratory supplies;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, insurance, equipment and other supplies.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated by program for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of our internal personnel related costs, facility costs, and lab supplies.
Our Restructuring Plan implemented in February 2022 resulted in the reduction of approximately 50% of our workforce, primarily consisting of our research organization, and as a result, we will not incur research expenses for the foreseeable future. We expect our development expenses will fluctuate in the future as we continue to focus on the development of MET642 for the treatment of UC. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future clinical trials of MET642 or any future product candidate due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast whether MET642 or any future product candidate may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
Our development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number and scope of preclinical studies;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, and insurance. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our development and other commercial activities if MET642 or any future product candidate receives marketing approval.
Total Other Income (Expense)
Total other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and interest expense under the K2 Loan Agreement.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $45.5 million and $26.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses of $18.7 million when comparing the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to increases of $20.2 million in clinical trial expenses related to our FXR program, $0.4 million in third-party medicinal chemistry services, and $0.1 million in personnel costs. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by decreases of $1.6 million in toxicology expenses and $0.4 million in laboratory supplies expense.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $15.6 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $5.7 million when comparing the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to increases of $3.0 million in personnel costs, including $1.5 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, $2.5 million of consulting, professional services and other public company related expenses, and $0.2 million of higher facilities and information technology expenses.
Total Other Income (Expense). Total other expense was $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in total other expense of $0.5 million when comparing the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to a decrease of $0.4 million in interest income resulting from lower average investment balances and yields during 2021 and an increase of $0.2 million in interest expense resulting from additional borrowings under the K2 Loan Agreement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $76.4 million.
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to our net loss of $62.2 million, adjusted for $8.6 million of noncash charges, and $6.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Noncash charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $6.9 million, amortization of our right-of-use asset of $0.7 million, noncash interest expense of $0.3 million, and $0.6 million from other noncash charges.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to our net loss of $37.3 million, adjusted for $6.4 million of noncash charges, and $5.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Noncash charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $5.0 million, amortization of our right-of-use asset of $0.6 million, noncash interest expense of $0.3 million, and $0.4 million from other noncash charges.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities of $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to sales and maturities of short-term investments of $86.6 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $42.7 million.
Net cash used in investing activities of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments of $79.9 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.2 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments of $48.0 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ATM offering program of $21.7 million, net proceeds from additional borrowings of long-term debt of $4.8 million, and proceeds from stock option exercises of $1.1 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of common stock from our IPO of $76.9 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.2 million.
K2 Loan Agreement
We borrowed $10.0 million in the first tranche under the K2 Loan Agreement in August 2019. In October 2021, we amended the K2 Loan Agreement and thereby replaced and superseded the $10.0 million of existing term loan tranches with new term loan tranches that enable us to borrow up to an aggregate of $45.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. We have borrowed $15.0 million under the first tranche, or the 2021 Refinancing Term Loans, and currently have $30.0 million in term loan tranches available to us upon the achievement of certain milestones under the terms of the K2 Loan Agreement. However, because we elected to discontinue future development of our FXR program in NASH as part of our restructuring plan in February 2022, we will be unable to borrow $10.0 million under two term loan tranches.
Term loans under the K2 Loan Agreement bear interest at a floating annual rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate used by lender plus 4.5% and (ii) 7.75%. The monthly payments on the 2021 Refinancing Term Loans are interest-only until July 1, 2023, and then subsequent to the interest-only period, the 2021 Refinancing Term Loans will be payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, through April 1, 2025, the maturity date. We are required to make final fee payments equal to $0.5 million on September 1, 2023 and 5.75% of the aggregate original principal amount of the 2021 Refinancing Term Loans at the maturity date. We may elect to prepay all, but not less than all, of the 2021 Refinancing Term Loans prior to the maturity date, subject to a prepayment fee of up to 3.0% of the then outstanding principal balance. After repayment, no term loan amounts may be borrowed again.
Our obligations under the K2 Loan Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property. The K2 Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and also includes standard events of default, including an event of default based on the occurrence of a material adverse event, and a default under any agreement with a third party resulting in a right of such third party to accelerate the maturity of any debt in excess of $0.3 million. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on us transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying cash dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and making any payment on subordinated debt, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Upon the occurrence and continuance
of an event of default, the lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the K2 Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the K2 Loan Agreement.
Sales Agreement
On October 4, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with SVB Leerink LLC, or SVB Leerink, to sell shares of common stock from time to time through our ATM equity offering program, under which SVB Leerink will act as our sales agent. We have no obligation to sell any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement. SVB Leerink will be entitled to compensation in an amount of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. A maximum of $50.0 million of shares of common stock may be sold under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we sold 15,534,172 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of $1.46, resulting in gross proceeds of $22.7 million. We incurred $1.0 million in issuance costs relating to our ATM offering program, consisting of $0.4 million in professional service fees and $0.6 million in underwriter commissions. As of December 31, 2021, we may sell up to an additional $27.3 million of shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement and pursuant to our ATM offering program.
Material Cash Requirements
As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations consisted primarily of the following (in thousands):
(1) Our Corporate Lease contains fixed payment terms based upon the passage of time and requires our payment of maintenance and real estate taxes. In March 2022, we entered into the Lease Termination Agreement which accelerates the expiration of the previous term our Corporate Lease (which extended through March 2023) to the later of March 31, 2022 and the date that our landlord executes a lease agreement with a third party for the premises. We expect that our Corporate Lease will terminate on or around March 31, 2022, at which point we will have no further obligations under our Corporate Lease.
(2) Our contractual obligation under the K2 Loan Agreement consists of principal payments, interest, and fees due to K2.
Under a license agreement with The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, or the FXR License Agreement, we have payment obligations that are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and are required to make development milestone payments and royalty payments in connection with sublicensing revenue and the sale of products developed under that agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or making future product sales and, therefore, any related payments are not included in the table above. For additional information regarding the FXR License Agreement, including our payment obligations thereunder, see “FXR License Agreement” in Item 1. “Business” and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical trial sites and clinical supply manufacturers and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts and not included in the table above.
In connection with the Restructuring Plan implemented in February 2022, we expect to incur aggregate costs ranging from $1.1 million to $1.3 million through the first half of 2022, substantially all of which will consist of one-time charges arising from severance obligations, accelerated vesting of certain equity awards and other customary employee benefits payments in connection with the staff reduction, but will include third-party research and development expenses incidental to the discontinuation of our HSD program. We may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, the Restructuring Plan.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our material cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. We expect to finance our longer-term expected
future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents and equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and other similar arrangements. In particular, we currently expect our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will allow us to fund the planned Phase 2a clinical trial of MET642 in UC. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain.
Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, rate of progress and costs of our drug discovery, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for MET642 or any future product candidate;
•
the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the extent to which we collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of MET642 or any future product candidates;
•
the scope and costs of manufacturing for MET642 or any future product candidate and commercial manufacturing activities;
•
the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of MET642 or any future product candidate;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of MET642 or any future product candidate;
•
the costs associated with being a public company;
•
the timing of any milestone and royalty payments to The Salk, or other future licensors;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and
•
the cost associated with commercializing MET642 or any future product candidate, if they receive marketing approval.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our capital needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional sufficient capital when needed, we may be required to:
•
delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs or other operations;
•
enter into strategic alliances or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;
•
dispose of technology assets, or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any future product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves;
•
pursue the sale of our company to a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our stockholders; or
•
file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Expenses
We make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost.
We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of equity awards recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. We estimate the fair value of all stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize forfeitures as they occur. Estimating the fair value of equity awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables, including the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of stock options, and the expected dividend yield. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
