ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including without limitation, statements containing the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates” and similar words, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. From time to time we may make other forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ as a result of many factors, including the risks discussed from time to time in this report, including the risks described under “Risk Factors” in any filings we have made with the SEC.
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to useful lives of real estate assets, cost reimbursement income, bad debts, impairment, net lease intangibles, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
Background
The Company was formed in Nevada in August 30, 2002 as IntelSource Group, Inc. and began operations in 2003. In 2007, IntelSource Group, Inc. merged with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC. The Company began acting as Electro Medical Technologies, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company on November 9, 2010 after the merger with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC, a Nevada Company. The Company converted to a corporation in the State of Delaware on August 23, 2017.
Electromedical Technologies is a bioelectronics manufacturing and marketing company. We offer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared medical devices for pain management.
Bioelectronics is a developing field of “electronic” medicine, which uses electrical impulses over the body’s neural circuitry to try to alleviate pain, without drugs. The human body is controlled by electrical signals sent through the nervous system, which can become distorted after accidents or as a result of disease. The field of bioelectronic medicine aims to safely correct irregularities in the nervous system by modifying the electrical language of the body related to pain relief.
Our mission is to improve global wellness for people suffering from various painful conditions by relieving chronic and acute pain using energy, frequency and vibration as an alternative to pharmaceuticals; and one day, read and modifies electrical signals passing along nerves in the body, to restore long-term health.
Additionally, we have a corporate goal to offer the public effective alternatives to addictive pain relieving drugs, such as opiods. According to the Society of Actuaries, opioid overdose deaths are now the single largest factor slowing the growth in U.S. life expectancy and has led to stagnation or decreases in life expectancy three years in a row for the first time since 1915-1918, when the country was facing World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that, from 1999 through 2017, nearly 400,000 have died from overdoses from prescription or illicit opiods. It is our aim to offer effective alternatives to pain management.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the audited results of our operations for the years ended December 31,
Operating Results
January 1,2021 through December 31,2021 Compared to January 1,2020 through December 31, 2020
Our sales totaled $907,362 for the year ended December 31,2021 and $737,958 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to an increase in units sold.
Cost of sales and gross margins for the year ended December 31,2021 and for the year ended December 31,2020 were $199,234 and 78% and $194,384 and 74%, respectively. Our cost of sales consists of the cost of materials and distribution expenses. Cost of sales and gross margins are affected by product mix as well as the mix in the level of sales between commissioned agents and distributors. Higher shipping and distribution costs in 2020 contributed to the decrease in gross margin.
The following table sets forth the operating expenses for the years ended December 31:
The following table sets forth the stock- based compensation expense included in the above operating expenses for years ended December 31:
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll related expenses, commissions, consulting and professional fees, sales and marketing, research and development and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $4,508,391 for the year ended December 31,2021 and $3,710,262 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $798,129 or about 22%. The change is primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $407,288, research and development costs of $183,720, payroll related costs of $220,383, and consulting and professional fees of $53,654, partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs of $99,157. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $963,428 related to third party agreements for financial and strategic advisory services, $604,890 related to shares of common stock issued to the Company’s CEO as compensation and $1,061,826 related to cashless warrants issued to the Company’s CEO and a key employee. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes $2,213,128 related to third party agreements for financial and strategic advisory services.
The increase in research and development costs reflects the Company’s ramped up efforts in the development of the POD. The increase in payroll related costs consists primarily of additional employee headcount and a bonus paid to the Company’s CEO totaling $105,042. The increase in consulting and professional fees relates primarily to costs associated with operating as a public company and raising capital. The decrease in marketing costs reflects termination of certain contracts in 2021.
Other expense increased by $3,974,850 primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $2,544,261 and an increase in the value of derivative liabilities of $1,487,098, partially offset by $50,083 of forgiven debt. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $2,351,189 related to the amortization of debt discount.
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of $8,480,149 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $3,871,724 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net loss is primarily attributed to the increase in interest expense, the increase in value of derivative liabilities, and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.
COVID-19 may impact our business.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and on March 11, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 include restrictions on travel, and quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. COVID-19, and actions taken to mitigate it, have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical areas in which we operate. While it is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the complete financial effect will be to the Company, COVID-19 may have an adverse effect
on our business. While we are taking diligent steps to mitigate any possible disruptions to our business, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts, at this time, to our future financial condition and results of operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $118,257 reflecting cash used in operations of $1,193,688, offset by net proceeds from financing activities of $1,311,945.

The decrease in cash flows used in operating activities is primarily the result of a decrease in inventory purchases and deposits and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in the loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense.

Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,311,945 for the year ended December 31,2021 as compared to $1,601,573 for the year ended December 31,2020. The cash flows provided in the 2021 period are primarily the result of $1,510,000 in net proceeds from convertible promissory notes partially offset by debt repayments totaling $198,055. The cash flows provided in the 2020 period are primarily the result of the following cash inflows:
$1,458,200 in net proceeds from convertible promissory notes
$155,900 in net proceeds from government debt

As additional consideration for entering into the forbearance agreement, the Company has agreed to issue the lender the number of shares equal to $100,000 on January 15,2022 at a 25% discount based upon the previous 15-day average closing price. Effective after January 15, 2022, if the Company enters into an agreement with a third-party investor for consideration per share less than the $0.50 fixed price per share of the notes, the Company agrees to amend and restate the notes to reduce the conversion price.
On March 25, 2022, the Company amended the forbearance agreement. Under the amendment, the maturity dates of the outstanding notes were changed to October 1, 2022. In addition, the Company will issue 8,000,000 shares of its common stock at a share price of $0.025, 4,000,000 which is in lieu of the discounted shares equal to $100,000 stated in the original agreement. The Company will also make six monthly payments of $30,000. The Company made a good faith payment of $30,000 in February 2022 and its first payment under the amendment in March 2022.
