1 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the following table.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Ameris has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) in the preparation of its financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations. We believe the following accounting policies applied by Ameris represent critical accounting policies.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We believe the allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is a critical accounting policy that requires significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The ACL is a valuation allowance estimated at each balance sheet date in accordance with GAAP that is deducted from financial assets measured at amortized cost to present the
net amount expected to be collected on those assets. Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers relevant information including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion.
Loans which share common risk characteristics are pooled for the purposes of determining the ACL. Management uses the discounted cash flow method or the PD×LGD method, which may be adjusted for qualitative factors, in measuring the ACL for pooled loans. Loans which do not share common risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. The expected credit losses may also be calculated, in the alternative, as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the estimated fair value of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell.
Management believes that the ACL is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize expected losses on loans, future additions to the ACL may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Company’s ACL. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the ACL based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Management determined the ACL on loans at December 31, 2021 using a weighting of five Moody's economic scenarios. If Management utilized the downside 96th percentile S-4 scenario from Moody's, the quantitative portion of the ACL on loans would have increased approximately $29.4 million.
Business Combinations
Assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. Loans which have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by our assessment are considered purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans. At acquisition, the expected credit loss of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date of the PCD loan. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the allowance for credit losses on PCD loans is recognized through provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis.
Prior to the adoption of CECL, on the date of acquisition, when loans had evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it was probable at the date of acquisition that the Company would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments ("purchased credit impaired loans"), the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition was referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The Company estimated expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows would generally result in a provision for credit losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows resulted in a reversal of the provision for credit losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which would have a positive impact on future interest income. In accordance with the transition requirements within the CECL standard, the Company's purchased credit impaired loans were treated as PCD loans upon adoption.
Income Taxes
As required by GAAP, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. See Note 13, “Income Taxes,” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as the provision for credit losses and gains on FDIC-
assisted transactions, for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet.
We must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income.
Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangibles
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets purchased in business combinations. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
Intangible assets include core deposit premiums from various past bank acquisitions as well as intangible assets recorded in connection with the certain non-bank acquisitions for referral relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements and patent assets. Intangible assets are initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the acquisition date.
Core deposit premiums acquired in various past bank acquisitions are based on the established value of acquired customer deposits. The core deposit premium is initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the acquisition date and is amortized over an estimated useful life of seven to ten years.
The referral relationships intangible is amortized over an estimated useful life of eight to ten years. Trade name intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated useful life of five to seven years. Non-compete agreement and patent intangible assets are being amortized over estimated useful lives of three years and ten years, respectively.
The valuation of intangible assets involves significant forward looking assumptions such as economic conditions, market interest rates, asset growth rates, credit losses, etc. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the valuation of the intangible assets.
Amortization periods for intangible assets are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.
Servicing Assets
We sell residential mortgage and SBA loans with servicing retained. We have also assumed servicing of loans sold with servicing retained, primarily indirect automobile loan pools, in prior acquisitions. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. Servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.
No less frequently than quarterly for mortgage servicing rights and semi-annually for all other servicing rights, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.
NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company’s net income during 2021 was $376.9 million, or $5.40 per diluted share, compared with $262.0 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in 2020, and $161.4 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, in 2019.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recorded net income of $81.9 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared with $94.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, and $61.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.
EARNING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Average earning assets were approximately $19.89 billion in 2021, compared with approximately $17.37 billion in 2020. The earning asset and interest-bearing liability mix is regularly monitored to maximize the net interest margin and, therefore, increase return on assets and shareholders’ equity.
The following statistical information should be read in conjunction with the remainder of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report and in the documents incorporated herein by reference.
The following tables set forth the amount of average balance, interest income or interest expense, and average interest rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin on average interest-earning assets. Federally tax-exempt income is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% federal tax rate.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest-earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities, other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposits in other banks. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings and subordinated deferrable interest debentures.
2021 compared with 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income was $703.1 million, a decrease of $23.4 million, or 3.2%, compared with the same period in 2020. Average earning assets increased $2.52 billion, or 14.5%, to $19.89 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $17.37 billion for 2020. Yield on average earning assets on a taxable equivalent basis decreased during 2021 to 3.56%, compared with 4.21% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average yields on all interest-earning asset categories except investment securities decreased from 2020 to 2021 as market interest rates declined.
Interest expense on deposits and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $47.8 million, a decrease of $41.0 million, or 46.2%, compared with $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021 average interest-bearing liabilities were $11.77 billion as compared with $11.25 billion for 2020, an increase of $520.4 million, or 4.6%. During 2021, average noninterest-bearing deposit accounts were $7.02 billion and comprised 38.5% of average total deposits, compared with $5.23 billion, or 34.4% of average total deposits, during 2020. Average balances of time deposits amounted to $1.95 billion and comprised 10.7% of average total deposits during 2021, compared with $2.39 billion, or 15.7% of average total deposits, during 2020.
On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2021 was $659.9 million, compared with $642.9 million in 2020, an increase of $17.0 million, or 2.6%. The Company’s net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased 38 basis points to 3.32% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accretion income for 2021 decreased to $16.3 million, compared with $27.4 million for 2020.
2020 compared with 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income was $726.5 million, an increase of $90.1 million, or 14.2%, compared with the same period in 2019. Average earning assets increased $4.24 billion, or 32.3%, to $17.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $13.13 billion for 2019. Yield on average earning assets on a taxable equivalent basis decreased during 2020 to 4.21%, compared with 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average yields on all interest-earning asset categories decreased from 2019 to 2020 as market interest rates declined.
Interest expense on deposits and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $88.8 million, a decrease of $42.5 million, or 32.4%, compared with $131.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2020 average interest-bearing liabilities were $11.25 billion as compared with $9.13 billion for 2019, an increase of $2.12 billion, or 23.2%. During 2020, average noninterest-bearing deposit accounts were $5.23 billion and comprised 34.4% of average total deposits, compared with $3.36 billion, or 28.8% of average total deposits, during 2019. Average balances of time deposits amounted to $2.39 billion and comprised 15.7% of average total deposits during 2020, compared with $2.70 billion, or 23.0% of average total deposits, during 2019.
On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2020 was $642.9 million, compared with $509.5 million in 2019, an increase of $133.4 million, or 26.2%. The Company’s net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased 18 basis points to 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accretion income for 2020 increased to $27.4 million, compared with $19.9 million for 2019.
The summary of changes in interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are shown in the following table:
Provision for Credit Losses
The Company's provision for credit losses on loans during 2021 amounted to a release of $35.1 million, compared with provisions of $125.5 million for 2020 and $19.8 million for 2019. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL and measured its allowance for credit losses on loans in 2021 and 2020 using an expected loss model while 2019 was measured under the incurred loss method. The decreased provision for 2021 was primarily attributable to improvements in forecast economic conditions, partially offset by organic loan growth and the addition of Balboa's portfolio. Net charge-offs in 2021 were 0.04% of average loans, compared with 0.31% in 2020 and 0.10% in 2019. The Company sold selected hotel loans during the fourth quarter of 2020 totaling $87.5 million which resulted in charge-offs of $17.2 million. Excluding the impact of the hotel sale, net charge-offs for 2020 would have been 0.18% of average loans.
At December 31, 2021, non-performing assets amounted to $101.9 million, or 0.43% of total assets, compared with $97.2 million, or 0.48% of total assets, at December 31, 2020. Other real estate was approximately $3.8 million as of December 31, 2021, reflecting a 67.9% decrease from the $11.9 million reported at December 31, 2020.
The Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2021 was $167.6 million, or 1.06% of loans compared with $199.4 million, or 1.38%, and $38.2 million, or 0.30%, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of loans compared with December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to improvements in forecast economic conditions in the Company's CECL model and the provision release recorded during 2021.
The Company's provision for unfunded commitments during 2021 amounted to $332,000, compared with $19.1 million for 2020 and no such provision for 2019. Subsequent to the adoption of CECL, the allowance for unfunded commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the current expected credit loss model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur as well as any third-party guarantees. The Company recorded a release of provision for other credit losses during 2021 totaling $616,000, compared with a provision of $830,000 for 2020 and no such provision for 2019.
Noninterest Income
Following is a comparison of noninterest income for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
2021 compared with 2020. Total noninterest income in 2021 was $365.5 million, compared with $446.5 million in 2020, reflecting a decrease of 18.1%, or $81.0 million.
Service charges on deposit accounts increased $961,000, or 2.2%, to $45.1 million during 2021 compared with 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in debit card interchange income and corporate services charges, partially offset by a decline in volume of NSF income which declined $1.8 million compared with 2020.
Other service charges, commission and fees increased by $274,000 to $4.2 million during 2021, an increase of 7.0% compared with 2020 due primarily to an increase in ATM fees.
Income from mortgage banking activities decreased $88.2 million, or 23.6%, to $285.9 million during 2021 compared with 2020. This decrease was a result of a decline in production and tightening of gain on sale spreads compared with 2020. Total production in the retail mortgage division decreased to $8.9 billion for 2021, compared with $9.8 billion for 2020, while gain on sale spreads decreased in 2021 to 3.31% from 3.79% in 2020. The decrease in gain on sale spread is primarily related to normalization of pricing in the industry after experiencing record production levels in 2020. Noninterest income from the Company's warehouse lending division increased $739,000 to $4.6 million for 2021 compared with $3.9 million for 2020.
Gain on sale of SBA loans decreased by $603,000, or 8.3%, to $6.6 million during 2021 compared with 2020, while loans sold decreased $12.5 million, or 14.0%, to $76.6 million during 2021 compared with 2020.
Other noninterest income increased by $6.1 million, or 35.5%, to $23.2 million during 2021 compared with 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in BOLI income, trust services income and merchant fee income of $1.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Non-mortgage loan servicing income decreased $249,000 in 2021 primarily due to increased amortization related to declines in serviced portfolio balances, partially offset by a $906,000 recovery of prior SBA servicing right impairment.
2020 compared with 2019. Total noninterest income in 2020 was $446.5 million, compared with $198.1 million in 2019, reflecting an increase of 125.4%, or $248.4 million.
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $6.6 million, or 13.1%, to $44.1 million during 2020 compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in volume of NSF income which declined $3.8 million compared with 2019. Also contributing to the decrease in service charge revenue was the full year impact of the Durbin Amendment which was effective for the Company beginning in the third quarter of 2019.
Other service charges, commission and fees increased by $348,000 to $3.9 million during 2020, an increase of 9.8% compared with 2019 due primarily to an increase in ATM fees.
Income from mortgage banking activities increased $254.7 million, or 213.3%, to $374.1 million during 2020 compared with 2019. This increase was a result of the full year impact of the Fidelity acquisition and additional growth from the low interest rate environment during 2020. Total production in the retail mortgage division increased to $9.8 billion for 2020, compared with $4.3 billion for 2019, while gain on sale spreads increased in 2020 to 3.79% from 2.75% in 2019. The increase in gain on sale spread is primarily related to improved pricing in the industry amid record production levels in the current low interest rate
environment. Noninterest income from the Company's warehouse lending division increased $1.9 million to $3.9 million for 2020 compared with $2.0 million for 2019.
Gain on sale of SBA loans increased by $1.2 million, or 19.3%, to $7.2 million during 2020 compared with 2019, while loans sold were approximately flat at $89.0 million during 2020 compared with 2019.
Other noninterest income decreased by $1.0 million, or 5.6%, to $17.1 million during 2020 compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in gain on BOLI proceeds of $2.6 million, partially offset by increases in BOLI income and trust services income of $770,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. Non-mortgage loan servicing income decreased $1.1 million in 2020 primarily due to increased amortization and impairment in the current low interest rate environment.
Noninterest Expense
Following is a comparison of noninterest expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
2021 compared with 2020. Total noninterest expense decreased $38.5 million, or 6.4%, in 2021 to $560.1 million from $598.6 million in 2020. Total noninterest expense for 2021 include approximately $4.2 million in merger-related charges and $510,000 in losses on sale of bank premises. Total noninterest expense for 2020 include approximately $1.4 million in merger-related charges, $624,000 in losses on sale of bank premises, $1.5 million in restructuring charges, $3.3 million in natural disaster and pandemic expenses charges, and $3.1 million in expenses related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2021 decreased by $33.3 million, or 5.7%, compared with 2020 levels.
Salaries and benefits decreased $22.5 million, or 6.2%, from $360.3 million in 2020 to $337.8 million in 2021. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in variable pay resulting from decreased production levels in our retail mortgage division. Salaries and benefits in our mortgage division decreased $17.0 million, or 9.2%, to $167.8 million in 2021. Also contributing to the decrease in salaries and benefits expense was a reduction in incentives tied to PPP loan production. Full time equivalent employees increased from 2,671 at December 31, 2020 to 2,865 at December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the Balboa acquisition in December 2021.
Occupancy costs decreased $4.3 million, or 8.2%, from $52.3 million in 2020 to $48.1 million in 2021 due primarily to a reduction in leased locations related to previously announced branch consolidations and efficiency initiatives.
Amortization of intangible assets decreased $4.6 million, or 23.7%, to $15.0 million for 2021 compared with $19.6 million for 2020. Core deposit intangibles are being amortized over an accelerated basis; therefore, the expense recorded will decline over the life of the asset.
Legal and other professional fees decreased $4.1 million, or 25.4%, from $16.0 million in 2020 to $11.9 million in 2021, primarily due to a decrease of $3.1 million related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation.
Merger and conversion charges were $4.2 million in 2021, an increase of $2.8 million, or 202.4%, compared with $1.4 million recorded for 2020. Merger and conversion charges for 2021 were primarily related to the acquisition of Balboa while expenses for 2020 were primarily related to the acquisition of Fidelity.
Other noninterest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 3.1%, to $53.1 million in 2021 from $54.9 million in 2020, resulting primarily from decreases in natural disaster and pandemic charges, credit investigations and loan related expenses for loans previously covered under loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC, partially offset by increases in other losses and tax and license expense. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in variable expenses related to our elevated mortgage production.
2020 compared with 2019. Total noninterest expense increased $126.7 million, or 26.8%, in 2020 to $598.6 million from $471.9 million in 2019. Total noninterest expense for 2020 include approximately $1.4 million in merger-related charges, $624,000 in losses on sale of bank premises, $1.5 million in restructuring charges, $3.3 million in natural disaster and pandemic expenses charges, and $3.1 million in expenses related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation. Total noninterest expense for 2019 include approximately $73.1 million in merger-related charges, $6.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises, $245,000 in restructuring charges, ($39,000) in natural disaster and pandemic expenses charges, and $463,000 in expenses related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2020 increased by $196.6 million, or 50.1%, compared with 2019 levels.
Salaries and benefits increased $136.3 million, or 60.9%, from $223.9 million in 2019 to $360.3 million in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in variable pay resulting from increased production levels in our retail mortgage division. Salaries and benefits in our mortgage division increased $102.3 million, or 124.0%, to $184.8 million in 2020. Also contributing to the increase in salaries and benefits expense was the full year impact of the Fidelity acquisition which closed at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019. Full time equivalent employees decreased from 2,722 at December 31, 2019 to 2,671 at December 31, 2020.
Occupancy costs increased $11.8 million, or 29.0%, from $40.6 million in 2019 to $52.3 million in 2020 due primarily to 62 branch locations being added during 2019 as a result of the Fidelity acquisition, partially offset by branch closures related to previously announced branch consolidations. Also contributing to the increase was approximately $2.1 million in lease termination expense related to locations closed as part of efficiency initiatives.
Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.9 million, or 10.7%, to $19.6 million for 2020 compared with $17.7 million for 2019 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the Fidelity acquisition.
Data processing and telecommunications expenses increased $7.5 million, or 19.5%, to $46.0 million for 2020 compared with $38.5 million for 2019. This increase reflects increased core banking system charges due to an increase in the number of accounts being processed by our core banking system as a result of the Fidelity acquisition and a volume related increase related to elevated production levels in our retail mortgage division.
Legal and other professional fees increased $5.3 million, or 50.2%, from $10.6 million in 2019 to $16.0 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation.
Merger and conversion charges were $1.4 million in 2020, a decrease of $71.7 million, or 98.1%, compared with $73.1 million recorded for 2019. Merger and conversion charges for both 2020 and 2019 were primarily related to the acquisition of Fidelity.
Loan servicing expenses were $20.9 million in 2020, an increase of $10.1 million, or 93.3%, compared with $10.8 million recorded for 2019, primarily due to an increase in serviced loans related to elevated mortgage production.
Other noninterest expense increased $12.2 million, or 28.6%, to $54.9 million in 2020 from $42.7 million in 2019, resulting primarily from increases in natural disaster and pandemic charges, insurance expense, and tax and license expenses, partially offset by decreases in loss on fixed assets, deposit charge-offs and travel related expenses. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in variable expenses related to our elevated mortgage production.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is influenced by statutory federal and state tax rates, the amount of taxable income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $119.2 million, compared with $78.3 million recorded in 2020 and $50.1 million
recorded in 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate was 24.0%, 23.0% and 23.7% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
BALANCE SHEET COMPARISON
LOANS
Management believes that our loan portfolio is adequately diversified. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans or significant concentrations in any one industry. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 71.7% of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate, compared with 67.0% at December 31, 2020.
The amount of loans outstanding at the indicated dates is shown in the following table according to type of loans.
The Company seeks to diversify its loan portfolio across its geographic footprint and in various loan types. Also, the Company’s in-house lending limit for a single loan is $40.0 million for construction loans and $50.0 million for term loans with stabilized cash flows, which would normally prevent a concentration with a single loan project. Certain lending relationships may contain more than one loan and, consequently, exceed the in-house lending limit. The Company regularly monitors its largest loan relationships to avoid a concentration with a single borrower. The largest 25 loan relationships as of December 31, 2021 based on committed amount are summarized below by type.
Total loans as of December 31, 2021, are shown in the following table according to their contractual maturity.
Total loans which have maturity dates after one year are summarized below by those loans that have predetermined interest rates and those loans that have floating or adjustable interest rates.
ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") represents an allowance for expected losses over the remaining contractual life of the assets adjusted for prepayments. The contractual term does not consider extensions, renewals or modifications unless the Company reasonably expects to execute a troubled debt restructuring with a borrower. The Company segregates the loan portfolio by type of loan and utilizes this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio.
The Company estimates the ACL on loans based on the underlying assets’ amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the financing receivable is originated or acquired, adjusted for applicable accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash, and charge-offs. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of ACL.
Expected credit losses are reflected in the ACL through a charge to credit loss expense. When the Company deems all or a portion of a financial asset to be uncollectible the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. The Company applies judgment to determine when a financial asset is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, an asset will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts at collection have been exhausted. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received.
The Company measures expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis, when the financial assets share similar risk characteristics. Depending on the nature of the pool of financial assets with similar risk characteristics, the Company uses the DCF method or the PD×LGD method which may be adjusted for qualitative factors.
The Company’s methodologies for estimating the ACL consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical loss experience was observed. The Company’s methodologies revert back to historical loss information on a straight-line basis over four quarters when it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses was evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans, with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing, past due and other loans that management believed might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention. We segregated our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilized this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio. In addition, based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent loan reviewers and regulatory authorities, we further segregated our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans. Certain reviewed loans were assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit. In establishing allowances, management considered historical loan loss experience but adjusted this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends, current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the Bank operates. Factors considered included, among others, current valuations of real estate in our markets, unemployment rates, the effect of weather conditions on agricultural related entities and other significant local economic events, such as major plant closings.
The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for credit losses on loans by loan category for the periods indicated. Management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category.
The following table provides an analysis of the net charge-offs (recoveries) by loan category for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment.
At December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on loans totaled $167.6 million, or 1.06% of loans, compared with $199.4 million, or 1.38% of loans, at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of loans compared with December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to improvements in forecast economic conditions and the related provision release recorded during 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net charge off ratio as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.04%, compared with 0.31% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily a result of the sale of certain hotel loans totaling $87.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 which resulted in charge offs of $17.2 million. The hotel loans sold were selected based on a number of factors, including the level of relationship with the borrower, tier of hotel brand underlying the property and market conditions in the area.
The provision for credit losses on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a release of $35.1 million, compared with a provision of $125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease primarily resulted from improvement in forecast economic conditions compared with the forecast at the December 31, 2020, partially offset by organic loan growth during 2021 and the addition of Balboa's portfolio in December 2021. As of December 31, 2021 our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets had decreased slightly to 0.43% from 0.48% at December 31, 2020.
NONPERFORMING LOANS
A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s judgment, the collection of the interest income appears doubtful. Interest receivable that has been accrued and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is reversed against interest income. Interest on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is recognized when received. Past due loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. The following table presents an analysis of loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
The restructuring of a loan is considered a “troubled debt restructuring” if both (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the Company has granted a concession.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a balance of $76.6 million and $85.0 million, respectively, in troubled debt restructurings. These totals do not include COVID-19 loan modifications accounted for under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. Further information on these loans is set forth under the heading "COVID-19 Deferrals" below. The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class classified separately as those currently paying under restructured terms and those that have defaulted (defined as 30 days past due) under restructured terms at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by types of concessions made, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by collateral types, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
COVID-19 Deferrals
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company offered affected borrowers payment relief under its Disaster Relief Program. These modifications primarily consisted of short-term payment deferrals or interest-only periods to assist customers. The Company has begun providing payment modifications to certain borrowers in economically sensitive industries of various terms up to nine months. Modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic and qualifying under the provisions of Section 4013 of the CARES Act are not deemed to be troubled debt restructurings. As of December 31, 2021, $41.7 million in loans remained in payment deferral under the COVID-19 pandemic Disaster Relief Program.
The table below presents short-term deferrals related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were not considered TDRs.
LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
Liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers, who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs, and the ability of our Company to meet those needs. We seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short-term investments (principally interest-bearing deposits in banks) and monthly amortizing loans. Another source of
liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans. In addition, our Company maintains relationships with correspondent banks, including the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which could provide funds on short notice, if needed.
A principal objective of our asset/liability management strategy is to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. This strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our Asset and Liability Committee (the “ALCO Committee”) which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity.
As part of our interest rate risk management policy, the ALCO Committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are “interest rate sensitive” and monitors its interest rate-sensitivity “gap.” An asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed, usually one year or less. The interest rate-sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate-sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. If our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently, the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal.
A simple interest rate “gap” analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the ALCO Committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as “interest rate caps”) which limit changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.
We manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income. Except for its effect on the general level of interest rates, inflation does not have a material impact on the balance sheet due to the rate variability and short-term maturities of its earning assets. In particular, approximately 61.4% of earning assets mature or reprice within one year or less. Mortgage loans, generally our loan category with the longest maturity, are usually made with fifteen to thirty year maturities, but a portion is at a variable interest rate with an adjustment between origination date and maturity date.
The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”), which was convened by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended a paced market transition to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) from LIBOR. On July 29, 2021, the ARRC formally recommended the forward-looking term rates based on SOFR published by CME Group. The federal banking agencies issued a statement in November 2020 reiterating that the use of SOFR is voluntary and they are not endorsing a specific replacement rate. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to LIBOR, which include certain financial instruments within investment securities, loans, other borrowings, subordinated deferrable interest debentures and derivative financial instruments. Organizations are currently working on industrywide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. Company management is monitoring developments in the financial markets and is evaluating the related risks. The Company has established a working committee with representatives from relevant functional areas to inventory the contracts and accounts that are tied to LIBOR and implement a transition plan for the affected items.
The following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2021, the interest rate sensitivity gap (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities), the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap, the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities) and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio. The table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms. However, the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers. In addition, various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates.
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Following is a summary of the carrying value of debt securities available-for-sale as of the end of each reported period:
Following is a summary of the carrying value of debt securities held-to-maturity as of the end of each reported period:
The amounts of securities available-for-sale and held-to in each category as of December 31, 2021 are shown in the following table according to contractual maturity classifications: (i) one year or less, (ii) after one year through five years, (iii) after five years through ten years and (iv) after ten years.
(1)The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities are presented based on contractual maturities. Actual cash flows may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
(2)Yields were computed using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. The weighted average yield for each maturity range was computed using the amortized cost of each security in that range.
(3)Yields on securities of state and political subdivisions are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis, using a tax rate of 21%.
The investment portfolio includes securities which are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of the related deferred tax effect. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the life of the securities. Realized gains and losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings on the trade date.
Management and the ALCO Committee evaluates available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation, to determine if credit-related impairment exists. Management first evaluates whether they intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired security before recovering its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the entire amount of unrealized loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security's amortized cost basis. If either of the above criteria is
not met, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is attributable to credit or resulted from other factors. The Company does not intend to sell these investment securities at an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity. Based on the results of management's review, at December 31, 2021, management determined none was attributable to credit impairment and increased the allowance for credit losses accordingly. The remaining $195,000 in unrealized loss was determined to be from factors other than credit. The Company's held-to-maturity securities have zero expected credit losses and no related allowance for credit losses has been established.
The Company’s investments in subordinated debt include investments in regional and super-regional banks on which the Company conducts regular analysis through review of financial information or credit ratings. Investments in preferred securities are also concentrated in the preferred obligations of regional and super-regional banks through non-pooled investment structures. The Company did not hold any investments in “pooled” trust preferred securities at December 31, 2021.
DEPOSITS
Average amount of various deposit classes and the average rates paid thereon are presented below.
We have a large, stable base of time deposits with little or no dependence on what we consider volatile deposits. Volatile deposits, in management’s opinion, are those deposit accounts that are overly rate sensitive and apt to move if our rate offerings are not at or near the top of the market. Generally speaking, these are brokered deposits or time deposits in amount greater than $250,000.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had brokered deposits of $326.0 million. The amounts of time certificates of deposit issued in amounts of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2021, are shown below by category, which is based on time remaining until maturity of (i) three months or less, (ii) over three through twelve months and (iii) greater than one year.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had estimated uninsured deposits of $9.11 billion and $5.14 billion, respectively. These estimates were derived using the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting.
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
In the ordinary course of business, our Bank has granted commitments to extend credit to approved customers. Generally, these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements or for construction period financing and have been approved within the Bank’s credit guidelines. Our Bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit. These commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable. The Bank uses the same credit policies for these off-balance-sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial
statements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The following table summarizes commitments outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table summarizes short-term borrowings for the periods indicated.
As of December 31, 2021, letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank totaling $420.0 million were used to guarantee the Bank’s performance related to a portion of its public fund deposit balances.
The following table sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, estimated costs to complete construction projects in progress and other binding commitments for capital expenditures were not a material amount.
CAPITAL ADEQUACY
Capital Regulations
The capital resources of the Company are monitored on a periodic basis by state and federal regulatory authorities. During 2021, the Company’s capital increased $319.4 million, primarily due to net income of $376.9 million, which was partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $42.0 million. During 2020, the Company’s capital increased $177.5 million, primarily due to net income of $262.0 million, which was partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $41.7 million and the adoption impact of CECL of $56.7 million. For both 2021 and 2020, other capital related transactions, such as other comprehensive income, share-based compensation, common stock issuances through the exercise of stock options, and issuances of shares of restricted stock accounted for only a small change in the capital of the Company.
Under the regulatory capital frameworks adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, Ameris and the Bank must each maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6%, a total capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets of at least 4%. Ameris and the Bank are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In March 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that implement CECL in 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. As a result, the Company and Bank elected the five-year transition relief allowed under the interim final rule effective March 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes the regulatory capital levels of Ameris at December 31, 2021.
The required CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, and the Total Capital Ratio reflected in the table above include a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%.
INFLATION
The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following table sets forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information of the Company. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements, which include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods.
