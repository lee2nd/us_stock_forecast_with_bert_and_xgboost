Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Veru is a biopharmaceutical company with a drug development program for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other viral-related ARDS and for the management of advanced breast and prostate cancers, as well as a sexual health program which includes two FDA-approved products, ENTADFI™, for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the FC2 Female Condom® (Internal Condom).
Infectious Disease Program:
The Company opportunistically developed sabizabulin 9mg, which has both broad anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties as a two-pronged approach to the treatment of COVID-19 virus infection in hospitalized moderate to severe patients at high risk for ARDS and death.
We discovered that sabizabulin, which is being developed for cancer indications, also has both broad anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. We hypothesized that based on this mechanism of drug action, sabizabulin may serve as a two-pronged approach to the treatment of COVID-19 viral infection, and the subsequent debilitating inflammatory effects that can lead to ARDS and death. The Company has completed a positive Phase 2 and positive Phase 3 COVID-19 study evaluating sabizabulin in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The Phase 3 clinical study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 204 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that died by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously halted the study for clear clinical efficacy and identified no safety concerns. Treatment with sabizabulin 9 mg once daily resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 51.6% relative reduction in deaths compared to placebo. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization for sabizabulin in adult hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death.
On May 10, 2022, the Company had a pre-EUA meeting with the FDA to discuss next steps including the submission of an EUA application regarding sabizabulin for COVID-19. The outcome of this meeting was: (i) the FDA agreed that no additional efficacy studies were required to support an EUA application or a new drug application (NDA); and (ii) the FDA agreed that no additional safety data was required to support an EUA application and that collection of safety data under the EUA may satisfy the safety requirement for an NDA. The FDA agreed that the request for the EUA is supported by efficacy and safety from our positive Phase 3 COVID-19 study in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS and death and no additional clinical trials are required to support an NDA submission. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization. On July 6, 2022, the Company announced the publication of the results from the Phase 3 COVID-19 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral sabizabulin in The New England Journal of Medicine Evidence. On November 9, 2022, the FDA’s Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) met to review sabizabulin for the EUA in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS. The advisory committee voted 8-5 that the known and potential benefits of sabizabulin when used for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of ARDS do not outweigh the known and potential risks of sabizabulin. However, there was additional discussion around the clinical trial design aspects of a potential confirmatory Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial as a post emergency use authorization requirement. The FDA considers the input of the advisory committee as part of their review of the EUA, but the advisory committee decision is not binding and the FDA makes the final decision on the request for EUA application.
The UK’s MHRA informed the Company on July 25, 2022, that the sabizabulin marketing authorization application will receive expedited review. On July 27, 2022, sabizabulin triggered Article 18 in the EU in which the EMA will evaluate sabizabulin to allow emergency use drug access to the EU Member States. On August 22, 2022, Australia’s TGA determined that sabizabulin treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS qualifies for an expedited, provisional registration regulatory pathway.
We want to focus the clinical development of sabizabulin, a broad spectrum antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, as a treatment for additional indications in COVID-19 ARDS, Influenza related ARDS, and other viral-associated ARDS.
Oncology Program:
The Company’s breast cancer drug pipeline has four clinical development programs for two drugs: enobosarm, oral selective androgen receptor agonist, and sabizabulin, oral microtubule disruptor.
Hormone receptor positive HER2- metastatic breast cancer:
Phase 3 clinical study - Enobosarm as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling the Phase 3 multicenter, international, open label, and randomized (1:1) ARTEST registration clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm monotherapy versus physician’s choice of either exemestane  everolimus or a SERM as the active comparator for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 210 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We have identified that patients who have sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue are most likely to respond to enobosarm. Based on the recommendation of the FDA to have a companion diagnostic test to determine the patient’s AR status, we are partnering with Roche/Ventana Diagnostics, a global oncology diagnostics company, who will develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic AR test.
Phase 2b clinical study - Sabizabulin as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We also intend to conduct a Phase 2b clinical study of sabizabulin, a novel oral cytoskeleton disruptor, for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining. The Phase 2b clinical trial will be an open label, multicenter, and randomized (1:1) study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sabizabulin 32mg monotherapy versus physician’s choice of either exemestane  everolimus or a SERM as the active comparator for the treatment of ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 200 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
Phase 3 clinical study - Enobosarm + abemaciclib combination as a 2nd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling a Phase 3 multicenter, open label, randomized (1:1), active control clinical study, named ENABLAR-2 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm plus abemaciclib combination therapy versus an alternative estrogen blocking agent (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor) in subjects with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer who have failed first line palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus an estrogen blocking agent (non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) and have sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue. We plan to enroll approximately 186 subjects in this Phase 3 clinical study. In January 2022, the Company entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement through which Eli Lilly and Company supplies abemaciclib for the ENABLAR-2 trial.
The Company’s prostate cancer drug pipeline includes sabizabulin, VERU-100 and zuclomiphene citrate.
Sabizabulin 32mg for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer-
Phase 1b/2 clinical studies to determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended dosing of sabizabulin. We are completing the Phase 1b open label clinical trial of sabizabulin in 39 men with metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer ± taxane chemotherapy and the Phase 2 clinical study in 41 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to proceeding to IV chemotherapy. In the Phase 1b/2 studies, sabizabulin was both well tolerated and demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy data.
Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study. We are currently enrolling the Phase 3 VERACITY registration study evaluating sabizabulin 32mg in men approximately 245 men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who had tumor progression while receiving at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to IV chemotherapy.
‎
VERU-100, long acting GnRH antagonist subcutaneous depot, for the treatment of advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer-
Phase 2 dose finding clinical study. Currently enrolling study to determine optimal dose of VERU-100 in men with advance hormone sensitive prostate cancer.
Phase 3 registration clinical study. If the Phase 2 trial is successful, and as discussed with and agreed upon by the FDA, the Phase 3 clinical trial will be a single arm, multicenter, open-label study in approximately 100 men with hormone sensitive advanced prostate cancer using the achievement and maintenance of castration levels of testosterone as the primary endpoint.
‎Zuclomiphene citrate, estrogen receptor agonist, for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer-
Phase 2b zuclomiphene clinical study. The Company reported positive dose finding Phase 2 study in January 2020. The Company plans to further optimize the dosing schedule of zuclomiphene citrate in a Phase 2b study.
Sexual Health Program:
The Company's sexual health program includes two FDA-approved products: ENTADFI™, for the treatment of BPH, and FC2, for the dual protection against unplanned pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.
ENTADFI™ (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use was approved by the FDA as a new oral treatment for BPH, or an enlarged prostate gland. The co-administration of tadalafil and finasteride has been shown to provide faster and more effective treatment of BPH than finasteride alone without causing unwanted sexual side effects. ENTADFI treats BPH with low potential for adverse sexual side effects, and we believe that ENTADFI being one single pill will help increase drug compliance whereas poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to an increased chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death. We have now initiated the U.S. commercial launch and availability of ENTADFI. We plan to market ENTADFI to healthcare providers and patients through digital marketing channels and distribution will also be conducted through pharmaceutical distribution channels. We plan to augment our marketing and sales efforts by seeking partners in the U.S. that offer us the ability to expand access through telemedicine and internet pharmacy services and will continue our search for the right commercial partners outside the U.S.
The Company sells FC2 in both the commercial sector and in the public health sector both in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., FC2 is available by prescription through multiple telemedicine and internet pharmacy channels as well as retail pharmacies. The Company has launched its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal/platform to continue to drive sales growth. FC2 is also available to public health sector entities such as state departments of health and 501(c)(3) organizations. In the global public health sector, the Company markets FC2 to entities, including ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, nonprofit organizations and commercial partners, that work to support and improve the lives, health and well-being of women around the world.
Most of the Company’s net revenues are currently derived from sales of FC2 in the commercial and public health sectors.
PREBOOST® Sale
On December 8, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Roman Health Ventures Inc. (the “Purchaser”). Pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser purchased substantially all of the assets related to the Company's PREBOOST® business. PREBOOST® is a 4% benzocaine medicated individual wipes for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The transaction closed on December 8, 2020. The purchase price for the transaction was $20.0 million, consisting of $15.0 million paid at closing, $2.5 million payable 12 months after closing and $2.5 million payable 18 months after closing. The Company has received all such purchase price payments.
COVID-19 Environment
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have emerged in Wuhan, China. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has since spread to over 100 countries, including every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak.
In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there were business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. In addition, and in an attempt to slow the rapid growth of the COVID-19 infection rate, many governments around the world, including in the United States at the federal, state and local levels as well as in the United Kingdom and Malaysia, have from time to time imposed mandatory sheltering in place and social distancing restrictions that severely limit the ability of its citizens to travel freely and to conduct activities. While many countries have relaxed these restrictions, surges in COVID-19 could lead to some or all of such restrictions being reimposed in the U.S. or elsewhere.
The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted the global healthcare system, including the conduct of clinical trials. Many healthcare systems have restructured operations to prioritize caring for those suffering from COVID-19 and to limit or cease other activities. The severe burden on healthcare systems caused by this pandemic has also impaired the ability of many research sites to start new clinical trials or to enroll new patients in clinical trials. The imposed mandatory sheltering in place and social distancing restrictions may delay the recruitment of patients and impede their ability to effectively participate in such trials. Significant fees may also be owed to contract research organizations associated with starting and stopping clinical trials, typically more so than delaying the start of a clinical trial.
To date, COVID-19 has not impacted the Company’s ability to supply product demand for FC2. Since the start of the pandemic, we have, from time to time, experienced some temporary disruptions to our manufacturing facility due to the implementation of government policies.
The Company has enrolled manufacturing staff in a vaccination program. 100% of the staff have received two doses of vaccination and more than 90% of staff have also received a booster. This has allowed shift patterns to return to normal and the facility is allowed to operate at 100% capacity under the current Malaysia control orders.
The Company has had and believes it continues to have a sufficient quantity of FC2 inventory both inside and outside of Malaysia to satisfy expected customer demand. The closure and reduced operating capacity due to COVID-19 during fiscal 2021 did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated operating results in fiscal 2021 or the first half of fiscal 2022 and we do not expect them to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results in foreseeable future periods. The Company continues to operate enhanced health and safety protocols to protect the employees at its Malaysian facility, to respond in the event an employee at the facility is determined to have tested positive for COVID-19, and to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s Malaysian manufacturing operations. However, no such measures can eliminate risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, and if the Company’s Malaysian manufacturing facility is subject to future government mandates to counter COVID-19 or encounters labor or raw material shortages, transportation delays or other issues, our ability to supply product to our customers could be disrupted.
The sole supplier of the nitrile polymer sheath for FC2 also produces surgical gloves and has at times prioritized their production during the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to do so, which could disrupt the Company’s supply of a critical raw material. However, at this time Malaysian ports are open for shipment, and we have only seen short delays in booking vessels for FC2 so we have factored this into our lead times when shipping product into key markets. Further actions taken to mitigate these factors include the Company’s continued focus on build of strategic stock to ensure supply is available during a period of potential disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption may also adversely affect customer demand for FC2. For example, sales of FC2 could be impacted in the U.S. prescription channel if insurance coverage is affected by job losses and in the global public health sector if governments delay future tenders or reduce spending on female condoms due to financial strains or changed spending priorities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material net impact on our consolidated operating results during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.
Significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels as a result of uncertainties, including the extent and rate of the spread of the virus that continue to fluctuate, the potential for additional peaks in infection rates, and the timing and availability of vaccines, treatments or cures to slow and eventually stop the spread. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact on our business or our operations; however, we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and its impact on our business closely and expect to reevaluate the timing of our anticipated clinical trials as the impact of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer.
Sales of FC2 in commercial and global public health sectors
FC2 Commercial Sector. In 2017, the Company began expanding access to FC2 in the U.S. by making it available by prescription. With a prescription, FC2 is covered by most insurance companies with no copay, coinsurance or deductible under the ACA. In 2018, we dissolved our small-scale marketing and sales program to focus our efforts in accessing fast-growing, highly reputable telemedicine firms to bring our much-needed FC2 product to patients with a prescription in a cost-effective and highly convenient manner. As a result of these efforts, the Company now supplies FC2 to telemedicine providers in the U.S. prescription channel. The Company continues working to develop supply and distributor relationships with additional telemedicine and other providers. The Company has launched its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine platform and pharmacy services portal to continue to drive sales growth.
FC2 Global Public Health Sector. FC2’s use is for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and the transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases and prevention of unplanned pregnancies, and the global public health sector has been an important market for FC2. Within the global public health sector, various organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.
FC2 has been distributed in the U.S. and 149 other countries. A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world. The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the world’s most underprivileged people. However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications and processing orders.
The Company is working to further develop a global market and distribution network for FC2 by maintaining relationships with global public health sector groups and completing strategic arrangements with companies with the necessary marketing and financial resources and local market expertise.
The Company currently has a limited number of customers for FC2 in the global public health sector who generally purchase in large quantities. Over the past few years, significant customers have included large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, the Brazil Ministry of Health through Semina Indústria e Comércio Ltda (Semina), the Company's distributor in Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa health authorities that purchase through the Company's various local distributors. Other customers include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, and NGOs.
Purchasing patterns for FC2 in the public health sector vary significantly from one customer to another and may reflect factors other than simple demand. For example, some governmental agencies purchase FC2 through a formal procurement process in which a tender (request for bid) is issued for either a specific or a maximum unit quantity. Tenders also define the other elements required for a qualified bid submission (such as product specifications, regulatory approvals, clearance by the World Health Organization, unit pricing and delivery timetable). Bidders have a limited period of time in which to submit bids. Bids are subjected to an evaluation process which is intended to conclude with a tender award to the successful bidder. The entire tender process, from publication to award, may take many months to complete, including administrative actions or appeals. A tender award indicates acceptance of the bidder’s price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units. Many governmental tenders are stated to be “up to” the maximum number of units, which gives the applicable government agency discretion to purchase less than the full maximum tender amount. Orders are placed after the tender is awarded; there are often no set dates for orders in the tender and there are no guarantees as to the timing or amount of actual orders or shipments. Orders received may vary from the amount of the tender award based on a number of factors including vendor supply capacity, quality inspections and changes in demand. Administrative issues, politics, bureaucracy, exchange rate risk, process errors, changes in leadership, funding priorities and/or other pressures may delay or derail the process and affect the purchasing patterns of public health sector customers. As a result, the Company may experience significant quarter-to-quarter sales variances in the global public health sector due to the timing and shipment of large orders of FC2.
In February 2022, the Company received a tender award to supply 57% of a tender covering up to 120 million female condoms over three years in the Republic of South Africa. The Company has received its first orders and is manufacturing units under this tender award. In October 2020, the Company was awarded up to 20 million units through its distributor in Brazil under the new Brazil female condom tender. The Company shipped approximately 9.7 million units under this tender in fiscal 2021. The Company does not anticipate any additional shipments under this tender in Brazil.
Revenues. The Company's revenues are primarily derived from sales of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and global public health sector. The Company also had revenues from sales of PREBOOST® (Roman Swipes) through the date the PREBOOST® business was sold on December 8, 2020. The Company has also begun to recognize revenues from sales of ENTADFI. These sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery of the product to the customers depending on contract terms.
The Company’s most significant customers have been telemedicine providers in the U.S. who sell into the prescription channel and global public health sector agencies who purchase and/or distribute FC2 for use in preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and/or family planning.
The Company manufactures FC2 in a leased facility located in Selangor D.E., Malaysia, resulting in a portion of the Company's operating costs being denominated in foreign currencies. While a significant portion of the Company's future unit sales are likely to be in foreign markets, all sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar. Effective October 1, 2009, the Company’s U.K. and Malaysia subsidiaries adopted the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, further reducing the Company’s foreign currency risk.
Operating Expenses. The Company manufactures FC2 at its Malaysian facility. The Company's cost of sales consists primarily of direct material costs, direct labor costs and indirect production and distribution costs. Direct material costs include raw materials used to make FC2, principally a nitrile polymer. Indirect production costs include logistics, quality control and maintenance expenses, as well as costs for electricity and other utilities. All the key components for the manufacture of FC2 are essentially available from either multiple sources or multiple locations within a source.
We have recently seen increases in the cost of the nitrile polymer used to produce FC2, as well as transportation, and may experience increases in other material costs due to the impact of COVID-19 and increased inflation. Our costs of sales and gross margins may be adversely impacted if we are unable to pass along cost increases to our customers.
Conducting research and development is central to our business model. The Company has multiple products under development and management routinely evaluates each product in its portfolio of products. Advancement is limited to available working capital and management’s understanding of the prospects for each product. If future prospects do not meet management’s strategic goals, advancement may be discontinued. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $70.6 million and $32.7 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2023, we expect to continue this trend of increased expenses relating to research and development due to advancement of multiple drug candidates.
‎
Results of Operations
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021
The Company generated net revenues of $39.4 million and net loss of $83.8 million, or $(1.05) per basic and diluted common share, in fiscal 2022, compared to net revenues of $61.3 million and net income of $7.4 million, or $0.10 per basic common share and $0.09 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021. Net revenues decreased 36% year over year.
Most of the Company’s net revenues were derived from sales of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and global public health sector. FC2 net revenues decreased 35% year over year. There was a 44% decrease in total FC2 unit sales and an increase in FC2 average sales price per unit of 17%. The principal factor for the increase in the FC2 average sales price per unit compared to prior year was an increase in the selling price of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and a decrease in volume discounts. The Company experienced a decrease of 35% in FC2 net revenues in the U.S. prescription channel and a decrease of 34% in FC2 net revenues in the global public health sector. The decrease in FC2 net revenues in the U.S. prescription channel is due to lower volume from telemedicine customers as a result of business challenges they experienced, which resulted in a slowdown in orders during the current year. We are working to restore ordering and utilization patterns in future periods based on growing awareness and demand through increased FC2 marketing efforts, as well as on-going discussions with new distribution partners in the telehealth sector. We are also working to generate additional revenues through our internal telehealth platform. We also expect to see growth in average sales price per unit based on the price increase in the U.S. prescription channel effective during fiscal 2022. We are working to increase U.S. public sector revenues through two new exclusive agreements recently executed. The reduction in the global public health sector is primarily due to sales in fiscal 2021 related to the Brazil and South Africa tenders, which did not repeat in fiscal 2022. Based on the recently awarded tender in South Africa for delivery in fiscal 2023, we expect to see an increase in sales volume in the global public health sector. Results in fiscal 2021 included net revenues of $0.9 million related to the PREBOOST® business before the sale of such business in December 2020. The Company began recognizing revenue from sales of ENTADFI in September 2022. Results in fiscal 2022 were not materially affected by such sales.
Significant variances in the Company’s results have historically resulted from the timing and shipment of large orders rather than from any fundamental changes in the business or the underlying demand for FC2. The Company is also currently seeing pressure on pricing for FC2 by large global agencies and donor governments in the developed world. As a result, the Company may continue to experience challenges for revenue from sales of FC2 in the global public health sector.
Cost of sales decreased to $8.8 million in fiscal 2022 from $13.3 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in unit sales.
Gross profit decreased to $30.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $47.9 million in fiscal 2021. Gross profit margin for fiscal 2022 was 78% of net revenues, which is consistent with that in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the decrease in the volume of FC2 sales.
Research and development expenses increased to $70.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $32.7 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 116%. The increase is primarily due to increased costs associated with the multiple in-process research and development projects, mainly for the Phase 3 COVID-19 registration trial, the Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study, and the Phase 3 ARTEST study; as well as increased personnel costs. During fiscal 2022, the Company had four Phase 3 clinical trials and two Phase 2 clinical trial ongoing with additional clinical trial initiations planned, compared to three Phase 3 clinical trials and three Phase 2 clinical trials during fiscal 2021. This clinical trial activity has resulted in increased costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $43.2 million in fiscal 2022 from $20.7 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 109%. The increase is due primarily to the following: an increase in compensation costs, resulting from increased personnel and an increase in salaries for a cost-of-living adjustment; increased share-based compensation costs, resulting from an increase in headcount and an increase in the fair value of stock options due to increased volatility in our stock price; and additional costs associated with the commercialization of ENTADFI™, commercialization costs related to preparations for the potential launch of sabizabulin for COVID-19, and the launch of the Company’s own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal/platform for FC2.
During fiscal 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of the Company’s PREBOOST® business of $18.4 million. See Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report for additional information.
Interest expense, which is related to the Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement, was $4.4 million in fiscal 2022, which is a decrease from $4.9 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease is due to amortization of discounts and deferred issuance costs in fiscal 2021 related to the Credit Agreement, which was paid in full in fiscal 2021, partially offset by an increase in the accretion of the Residual Royalty Agreement liability.
Income recorded associated with the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives related to Residual Royalty Agreement was $3.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to expense of $3.7 million in fiscal 2021. The liabilities associated with embedded derivatives represent the fair value of the change of control provisions in the Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement. The decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivates is due to a decrease in projected FC2 net revenues in future periods and increase in the discount rates used, driven by external market factors. See Note 3 and Note 9 to the financial statements included in this report for additional information.
The income tax expense in fiscal 2022 was $236,000, compared to the income tax benefit of $3.1 million in fiscal 2021. The change in income tax expense is primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2021 resulting from an adjustment to the value of the U.K. net operating losses due to an increase in the U.K. tax rates from 19% to 25% in fiscal 2021. The U.S. continues to have a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets; therefore, activity in the U.S. does not have a material effect on income tax expense.
Liquidity and Sources of Capital
Liquidity
Our cash and cash equivalents on September 30, 2022 was $80.2 million, compared to $122.4 million on September 30, 2021. On September 30, 2022, the Company had working capital of $63.3 million and stockholders’ equity of $80.8 million compared to working capital of $136.0 million and stockholders’ equity of $152.3 million as of September 30, 2021. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, related to our increased research and development expenditures, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued research and development costs.
We anticipate that we will continue to consume cash as we develop our drug candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to fund development of our drug candidates and obtain regulatory approvals. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital” for a description of certain risks that will affect our future capital requirements.
The Company believes its current cash position and cash expected to be generated from sales of the Company’s commercial products are adequate to fund planned operations of the Company for the next 12 months. To the extent the Company may need additional capital for its operations or the conditions for raising capital are favorable, the Company may access financing alternatives that may include debt financing, common stock offerings, or financing involving convertible debt or other equity-linked securities and may include financings under the Company’s current effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493) or under a new registration statement.
Operating activities
Our operating activities used cash of $47.5 million in fiscal 2022.

Sources of Capital
Common Stock Offering
On February 22, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 7,419,354 shares of our common stock, which included the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share. Net proceeds to the Company from this offering were $108.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and costs incurred by the Company. All of the shares sold in the offering were by the Company. The offering was made pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493).
SWK Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement
On March 5, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with the financial institutions party thereto from time to time (the “Lenders”) and SWK Funding LLC, as agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”), for a synthetic royalty financing transaction. On and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided the Company with a term loan of $10.0 million, which was advanced to the Company on the date of the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly payments on the term loan based on the Company’s product revenue from net sales of FC2 until the earlier of receipt by the Lenders of a return premium specified in the Credit Agreement or a required payment upon termination of the Credit Agreement on March 5, 2025 or an earlier change of control of the Company or sale of the FC2 business. The Company repaid the loan and return premium specified in the Credit Agreement in August 2021, and as a result has no further obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Agent has released its security interest in Company collateral previously pledged to secure its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
In connection with the Credit Agreement, Veru and the Agent also entered into a Residual Royalty Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2018 (as amended, the “Residual Royalty Agreement”), which provides for an ongoing royalty payment of 5% of product revenue from net sales of FC2, which continues after the repayment of the loan and return premium under the Credit Agreement. The Residual Royalty Agreement will terminate upon (i) a change of control or sale of the FC2 business and the payment by the Company of the amount due in connection therewith pursuant to the Credit Agreement, or (ii) mutual agreement of the parties.
The Company made total payments under the Residual Royalty Agreement of $2.6 million and $1.1 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company made total payments under the Credit Agreement of $7.3 million during fiscal 2021. The Company currently estimates the aggregate amount of quarterly revenue-based payments payable during the 12-month period subsequent to September 30, 2022 will be approximately $1.2 million under the Residual Royalty Agreement.
Common Stock Purchase Agreements
On June 26, 2020, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “2020 Purchase Agreement”) with Aspire Capital which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company has the right, from time to time in its sole discretion during the 36-month term of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, to direct Aspire Capital to purchase up to $23.9 million of the Company’s common stock in the aggregate. Upon execution of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold to Aspire Capital under the 2020 Purchase Agreement 1,644,737 shares of common stock at a price per share of $3.04, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000. Other than the 212,130 shares of common stock issued to Aspire Capital in consideration for entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement and the initial sale of 1,644,737 shares of common stock, the Company has no obligation to sell any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2020 Purchase Agreement and the timing and amount of any such sales are in the Company's sole discretion subject to the conditions and terms set forth in the 2020 Purchase Agreement. The Company has not sold shares to Aspire Capital under the 2020 Purchase Agreement since June 2020. As of September 30, 2022, there was $18.9 million remaining under the 2020 Purchase Agreement, which is registered under the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493).
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company is required to adopt various accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience to the extent practicable and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. If the Company’s assumptions prove inaccurate or if future results are not consistent with historical experience, the Company may be required to make adjustments in its policies that affect reported results. The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements included in this report.
The Company’s most critical accounting estimates include: valuation of tax assets and liabilities, measurement of fair value, and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company has other key accounting policies that are less subjective and, therefore, their application is less subject to variations that would have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations. The following is a discussion of the Company’s most critical policies, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.
Income Taxes
The Company files separate income tax returns for its foreign subsidiaries. ASC Topic 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are also provided for carryforwards for income tax purposes. In addition, the amount of any future tax benefits is reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized.
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
The Company completes a detailed analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances on an annual basis or more frequently if information comes to its attention that would indicate that a revision to its estimates is necessary. In evaluating the Company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence on a country by country basis, including past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income, and the potential Section 382 limitation on the net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in control. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions to forecast U.S. federal and state, U.K. and Malaysia operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of the future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the Company’s business. It should be noted that the Company realized significant losses through 2005 on a consolidated basis. From fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2015, the Company generated taxable income on a consolidated basis. However, the Company had a cumulative pretax loss in the U.S. for fiscal 2022 and the three preceding fiscal years. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Management has projected future pretax losses in the U.S. driven by the investment in research and development and based on their analysis concluded that an additional valuation allowance of $25.8 million should be recorded against the U.S. deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2022. In addition, the Company’s U.K. holding company for the non-U.S. operating companies, The Female Health Company Limited, continues to have a full valuation allowance of $3.2 million. The operating U.K. subsidiary, The Female Health Company (UK) plc does not have a valuation allowance due to projections of future taxable income for the next 10 years.
Although management uses the best information available, it is reasonably possible that the estimates used by the Company will be materially different from the actual results. These differences could have a material effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.
Our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes and addition of the valuation allowance against the NOL carryforwards. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles. In addition, we may be subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
Fair Value Measurements
As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which consisted of embedded derivatives, represents the fair value of the change of control provisions in the Residual Royalty Agreement. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in this report.
The fair value of these liabilities were estimated based on unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement), which requires highly subjective judgment and assumptions. The Company previously determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Since the Credit Agreement has been satisfied as of September 30, 2021, the fair value of the embedded derivative within the Residual Royalty Agreement has been calculated by using a scenario-based method, whereby different scenarios are valued and probability weighted. The Company determined that with only the embedded derivative under the Residual Royalty Agreement remaining, there is no material difference between these two valuation models. The scenario-based valuation model incorporates transaction details such as the contractual terms of the instrument and assumptions including projected FC2 revenues, expected cash outflows, probability and estimated dates of a change of control, risk-free interest rates and applicable credit risk. As a result, the use of different estimates or assumptions would result in a higher or lower fair value and different amounts being recorded in the Company’s financial statements. Material changes in any of these inputs could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at future reporting dates, which could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 3 to the financial statements included in this report.
The fair value of the embedded derivatives at September 30, 2022 was $4.3 million compared to $7.9 million at September 30, 2021. The Company recognized non-operating income of $3.6 million to adjust the fair value of these instruments. The decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivates is due to a decrease in projected FC2 net revenues in future periods and increases in the discount rates, resulting from external market factors.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company has $6.9 million recorded as goodwill at September 30, 2022 and 2021 and $4.0 million recorded as intangible assets at September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consists of in-process research and development (IPR&D), on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If these facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses for recovery by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows. Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
Regarding goodwill, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. See further discussion in Note 1 to the financial statements included in this report.
IPR&D assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment. If the related project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of their carrying value over fair value. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using internal and external sources with respect to the Company’s future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. See further discussion in Note 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements included in this report.
