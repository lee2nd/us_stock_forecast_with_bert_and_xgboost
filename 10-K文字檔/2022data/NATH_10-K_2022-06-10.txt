Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Introduction
Overview of the Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, designated COVID-19.
During the fiscal 2021 period, COVID-19 spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world and government authorities implemented various measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 caused consumers to avoid or to limit non-essential travel, gatherings in public places and other social interactions. As such our Company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants experienced reduced customer traffic, as well as instances of reduced store-level operations, which in turn resulted in reduced sales at our Company-owned restaurants and reduced fees and royalties from our franchisees. Additionally, operations at many of our Branded Product Program customers were negatively impacted as many of our customers operated in venues that were either closed or operating at reduced traffic levels, such as professional sports arenas, amusement parks, shopping malls and movie theaters.
During the fiscal 2022 period, the number of COVID-19 cases began to stabilize with approved vaccines being more widely distributed and administered and, as a result, more regions continued to loosen restrictions, adhering to state and local guidelines. We experienced an increase in customer traffic at our Company-owned stores, particularly in Coney Island and we were able to safely reopen 97% of our franchise system which translated into higher Company-store sales and higher franchise fees and royalties. Additionally, most of our Branded Product Program customers reopened as well, driving increases in revenues over the fiscal 2021 period.
We continue to follow guidance from health officials in determining the appropriate restrictions, if any, to place within our operations. Our Company-owned and franchised restaurants have been and could continue to be disrupted by COVID-19 related employee absences or due to changes in the availability and cost of labor. We remain in regular contact with our major suppliers and to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain; however, we have experienced rising transportation costs, rising costs of hot dogs due to the higher costs for beef and beef trimmings, and other food costs and paper products, which could continue to increase as the impacts of COVID-19 continue across the global supply chain.
We anticipate that inflationary pressures that began in the latter half of fiscal 2022 in labor and commodity costs, in particular beef and beef trimmings, will continue into fiscal 2023 and may impact our operations.
There continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic as variants including Omicron and BA.2, a subvariant of Omicron, have caused increases in the number of reported COVID-19 cases. We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its ultimate impact on our business in the short or long-term. The ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels, and may result in reduced customer traffic and consumer spending trends that may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Overview
We are engaged primarily in the marketing of the “Nathan’s Famous” brand and the sale of products bearing the “Nathan’s Famous” trademarks through several different channels of distribution. Historically, our business has been the operation and franchising of quick-service restaurants featuring Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, and a variety of other menu offerings. Our Company-owned and franchised units operate under the name “Nathan’s Famous,” the name first used at our original Coney Island restaurant opened in 1916. Nathan’s product licensing program sells packaged hot dogs and other meat products to retail customers through supermarkets or grocery-type retailers for off-site consumption. Our Branded Product Program enables foodservice retailers and others to sell some of Nathan’s proprietary products outside of the realm of a traditional franchise relationship. In conjunction with this program, purchasers of Nathan’s products are granted a limited use of the Nathan’s Famous trademark with respect to the sale of the purchased products, including Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, certain other proprietary food items and paper goods. Our Branded Menu Program is a limited franchise program, under which foodservice operators may sell a greater variety of Nathan’s Famous menu items than under the Branded Product Program.
Our revenues are generated primarily from selling products under Nathan’s Branded Product Program, operating Company-owned restaurants, licensing agreements for the sale of Nathan’s products within supermarkets and club stores, the sale of Nathan’s products directly to other foodservice operators and the manufacture of certain proprietary spices by third parties and franchising the Nathan’s restaurant concept (including the Branded Menu Program and virtual kitchens).
The following summary reflects the franchise openings and closings of the Nathan’s franchise system (including the Branded Menu Program) for the fiscal years ended March 27, 2022, March 28, 2021, March 29, 2020, March 31, 2019, and March 25, 2018.
(A)
Including 27 Branded Menu Program locations in Ukraine which are temporarily closed as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
(B)
Excluding our virtual kitchens.
At March 27, 2022, our franchise system consisted of 239 Nathan’s franchised units, including 122 Branded Menu units located in 18 states, and twelve foreign countries. We also operate four Company-owned restaurants (including one seasonal unit), within the New York metropolitan area.
Our strategic emphasis is focused on increasing the number of distribution points for our products across all of our business platforms, including our Licensing Program for distribution of Nathan’s Famous branded consumer packaged goods, our Branded Products Program for distribution of Nathan’s Famous branded bulk products to the foodservice industry, and our namesake restaurant system comprised of both Company-owned and franchised units, including virtual kitchens. The primary drivers of our recent growth have been our Licensing and Branded Product Programs, which are the largest contributors to the Company’s revenues and profits.
We continue to reinvigorate our restaurant system. The operating plan we have adopted in this regard is focused on surrounding our core items, Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs and crinkle-cut French fries, with other much higher quality menu items developed to deliver best-in-class customer experience and greater customer frequency. Menu development activities have been combined with concept positioning efforts, operational improvements and more effective digital and social marketing campaigns. The goal is to improve the performance of the existing restaurant system and to grow it through franchising efforts including virtual kitchens. In fiscal 2022, we grew the number of virtual kitchens by 157 units from 130 at March 28, 2021 to 287 at March 27, 2022, including 214 domestically and 73 internationally. While we do not expect to significantly increase the number of Company-owned restaurants, we may opportunistically and strategically invest in a small number of new units as showcase locations for prospective franchisees and master developers as we seek to grow our franchise system. We continue to seek opportunities to drive sales in a variety of ways as we adapt to the ever-changing consumer and business climate.
As described in Risk Factors and other sections in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 27, 2022, our future results could be impacted by many developments including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, as well as our dependence on John Morrell & Co. as our principal supplier. In March 2014, John Morrell & Co., a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc. became Nathan’s exclusive licensee to manufacture and sell hot dogs, sausage and corned beef at retail. Our future operating results are substantially dependent on our agreement with John Morrell & Co. There are also certain risks associated with engaging John Morrell & Co. as exclusive licensee including whether (i) we can maintain or improve the quality and consistency of our products that is expected by our customers, and (ii) John Morrell & Co. will have a sufficient supply of products available for our customers on a timely basis, as well as the risks described under “Risk Factors - - Our licensing revenue and overall profitability is substantially dependent on our agreement with John Morrell & Co. and the loss or a significant reduction of this revenue would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.”
Our future operating results could be impacted by supply constraints on beef prices and/or increases in beef prices.
On November 1, 2017, the Company issued $150.0 million of 6.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes") in a private offering in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2025 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated November 1, 2017, (the “Indenture”) by and among the Company, certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral trustee. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2025 Notes offering to (i) satisfy and discharge the Indenture relating to the 2020 Notes; (ii) redeem the 2020 Notes (the "Redemption"), (iii) pay a portion of a special $5.00 per share cash dividend to Nathan's stockholders of record (see Note J of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iv) used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company also funded the majority of the special dividend of $5.00 per share through its existing cash. The Redemption occurred on November 16, 2017.
The 2025 Notes bear interest at 6.625% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 1st and November 1st of each year. During the fiscal year ended March 27, 2022, the Company made its required semi-annual interest payments on May 1, 2021 and November 1, 2021, as well as its required interest payment of $626,000 on January 26, 2022 in connection with the partial redemption of its 2025 Notes. On May 1, 2022, the Company paid its first semi-annual interest payment of fiscal 2023.
The 2025 Notes have no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to its final maturity on November 1, 2025.
Our future results may be impacted by our interest obligations under the 2025 Notes. As a result of the 2025 Notes and the subsequent partial redemption which occurred on January 26, 2022, the Company expects to incur annual interest expense of $7,287,500 per annum and annual amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately $507,000. The terms and conditions of the 2025 Notes are as follows (terms not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture):
There are no ongoing financial maintenance covenants associated with the 2025 Notes. As of March 27, 2022, Nathan’s was in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2025 Notes.
The Indenture contains certain covenants limiting the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions on, redeem or repurchase, capital stock; (iii) make investments or other restricted payments; (iv) create or incur certain liens; (v) incur restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions from its restricted subsidiaries; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) sell assets; or (viii) effect a consolidation or merger. Certain Restricted Payments which may be made or indebtedness incurred by Nathan’s or its Restricted Subsidiaries may require compliance with the following financial ratios:
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio: the ratio of the Consolidated Cash Flow to the Fixed Charges for the relevant period, currently set at 2.0 to 1.0 in the Indenture. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio applies to determining whether additional Restricted Payments may be made, certain additional debt may be incurred and acquisitions may be made.
Priority Secured Leverage Ratio: the ratio of (a) Consolidated Net Debt outstanding as of such date that is secured by a Priority Lien to (b) Consolidated Cash Flow of Nathan’s for the Test Period then most recently ended, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate; currently set at 0.40 to 1.00 in the Indenture.
Secured Leverage Ratio: the ratio of (a) Consolidated Net Debt outstanding as of such date that is secured by a Lien on any property of Nathan’s or any Guarantor to (b) Consolidated Cash Flow of Nathan’s for the Test Period then most recently ended, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate. The Secured Leverage Ratio under the Indenture is 3.75 to 1.00 and applies if Nathan’s wants to incur additional debt on the same terms as the 2025 Notes.
The Indenture also contains customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to pay interest, failure to comply with agreements related to the Indenture, failure to pay at maturity or acceleration of other indebtedness, failure to pay certain judgments, and certain events of insolvency or bankruptcy. Generally, if any event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 2025 Notes may declare the 2025 Notes due and payable by providing notice to the Company. In case of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the 2025 Notes, will become immediately due and payable.
The 2025 Notes are general senior secured obligations, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not subordinated, are senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness, are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2025 Notes, and are effectively junior to all existing and future indebtedness that is secured by assets other than the collateral securing the 2025 Notes.
Pursuant to the terms of a collateral trust agreement, the liens securing the 2025 Notes and the guarantees will be contractually subordinated to the liens securing any future credit facility.
The Company may redeem some or all of the 2025 Notes at a decreasing premium over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest as follows:
On December 15, 2021, the Company announced its intent to complete the partial redemption, in the principal amount of $40,000,000, of the 2025 Notes, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture. The redemption price of the redeemed notes was 101.656% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest from, and including November 1, 2021 to, but excluding, the redemption date of January 26, 2022. On January 26, 2022, the Company completed the redemption by paying cash of $41,288,000, inclusive of the redemption premium and accrued interest, and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of $1,354,000 that primarily reflected the redemption premium of $662,000 and the write-off of a portion of previously recorded debt issuance costs of $692,000.
In certain circumstances involving a change of control, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s 2025 Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the date of purchase.
If the Company sells certain collateralized assets and does not use the net proceeds as required, the Company will be required to use such net proceeds to repurchase the 2025 Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest penalty, if any, to the date of repurchase.
The 2025 Notes may be traded between qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. We have recorded the 2025 Notes at cost.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Leases
We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Our material operating leases consist of our Company-owned restaurants and Corporate office space. Renewal options are typically not included in the lease term as it is not reasonably certain at commencement date that we would exercise the option to extend the lease. Our real estate leases typically provide for fixed minimum rent payments and/or contingent rent payments based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. Fixed minimum rent payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rent payments are recognized each period as the liability is incurred or the asset is earned.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at time of lease inception. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for any payments made before the commencement date, initial direct costs and lease incentives earned.
The lease liability equals the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term and is discounted using the incremental borrowing rate, as the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable. This incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. If the estimate of our incremental borrowing rate was changed, our operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially.
Revenue Recognition
We earn revenues through our Company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants and virtual kitchens. Retail sales from franchised restaurants and virtual kitchens are reported to us by our franchisees and virtual kitchen operators and are not included in our revenues. Retail sales from Company-owned restaurants are recognized at the point-of-sale. Royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised restaurants and virtual kitchens are generally based on a percentage of sales and recognized on a monthly basis when it is earned and deemed collectible. Franchise fees, renewal fees, area development fees, and transfer fees are recognized as revenue over the term of each respective agreement, or upon termination of the franchise agreement. Revenues from Company-owned restaurants and revenues from franchisees and our virtual kitchen operators can fluctuate from time-to-time as a result of restaurant count and sales level changes.
We may also generate revenues from advertising contributions which are made to the Company’s Advertising Fund which are also generally based on a percentage of sales. Some vendors that supply products to the Company and our restaurant system may also contribute to the Advertising Fund based upon purchases made by our franchisees and at Company-owned restaurants.
Revenue from license royalties is generally based on a percentage of sales, subject to certain annual minimum royalties, recognized on a monthly basis when it is earned and deemed collectible.
The Company recognizes sales from the Branded Product Program and certain products sold from the Branded Menu Program upon delivery to Nathan’s customers via third party common carrier.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill of $95,000 resulting from the acquisition of Nathan’s in 1987; and (ii) trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property of $1,043,000 in connection with Arthur Treacher’s. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. As of March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and has determined that no impairment is deemed to exist.
The Company determined its intangible asset to have a finite useful life based on the expected future use of this intangible asset. Based upon the review of the current Arthur Treacher’s co-branding agreements, the Company determined that the remaining useful lives of these agreements is twelve years and the intangible asset is subject to annual amortization. The Company has recorded amortization expense of $113,000 during each of the fiscal years ending March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021. The Company’s definite-lived intangible asset is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company tested for recoverability of its definite-lived intangible asset based on the projected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from such co-branding agreements. Based on the quantitative test performed, the Company determined that the definite-lived intangible asset was recoverable and no impairment charge was recorded for the fiscal years ended March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets include property, equipment and right of use assets for operating leases with finite useful lives. Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets whenever impairment factors are determined to be present. The Company tests the recoverability of its long-lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company tests for recoverability based on the projected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from such asset. If the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company will record an impairment loss, if any, based on the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset. The Company generally measures fair value by considering discounted estimated future cash flows from such asset. Cash flow projections and fair value estimates require significant estimates and assumptions by management. Should the estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material. The Company considers a history of restaurant operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations. No long-lived assets were deemed impaired during the fiscal years ended March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021.
Stock-Based Compensation
As discussed in Note L.2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have one active share-based compensation plan that provides stock options and restricted stock awards for certain employees and non-employee directors to acquire shares of our common stock. For stock option awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions in determining the value of stock-based compensation including:
(a) expected option term based upon expected termination behavior;
(b) volatility based upon historical price changes of the Company’s common stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option;
(c) expected dividend yield; and
(d) risk free interest rate on date of grant.
Income Taxes
The Company’s current provision for income taxes is based upon its estimated taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, after considering the impact on taxable income of temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and any operating loss or tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Should management determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company has recorded liabilities for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions based on the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Nathan’s recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as part of the income tax provision. See Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which simplifies various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and, also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The Company adopted this guidance on March 29, 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Standard Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which significantly changes the impairment model for most financial instruments. Current guidance requires the recognition of credit losses based on an incurred loss impairment methodology that reflects losses once the losses are probable. Under the new standard, the Company will be required to use a current expected credit loss model (“CECL”) that will immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the financial instruments that are in the scope of this update, including trade receivables. The CECL model uses a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in the development of credit loss estimates. In November 2019, the FASB deferred the effective date for smaller reporting companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. This standard is required to take effect in Nathan’s first quarter (June 2023) of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations
Fiscal year ended March 27, 2022 compared to fiscal year ended March 28, 2021
Revenues
Total revenues increased by $39,043,000 to $114,882,000 for the fifty-two weeks ended March 27, 2022 as compared to $75,839,000 for the fifty-two weeks ended March 28, 2021 as we lapped the significant impact of COVID-19 on our results beginning in March 2020.
Total sales were $77,227,000 for the fifty-two weeks ended March 27, 2022 as compared to $41,326,000 for the fifty-two weeks ended March 28, 2021. Foodservice sales from the Branded Product Program were $66,322,000 for the fiscal 2022 period as compared to sales of $33,617,000 for the fiscal 2021 period. The sales from our Branded Product Program have increased as certain government mandated restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have eased with approved vaccines being more widely distributed and administered. Most of our Branded Product Program customers have reopened adhering to state and local guidelines, such as professional sports arenas, amusement parks, shopping malls and movie theaters. During the fiscal 2022 period, the total pounds of hot dogs sold in the Branded Product Program increased by approximately 78% as compared to the fiscal 2021 period. Our average selling prices, which are partially correlated to the beef markets, increased by approximately 10% as compared to the fiscal 2021 period.
Total Company-owned restaurant sales were $10,905,000 during the fiscal 2022 period compared to $7,709,000 during the fiscal 2021 period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our average check and an increase in traffic at our Coney Island locations due to the easing of certain government mandated restrictions as a result of the public health measures taken to reduce exposure to the COVID-19 virus compared to the fiscal 2021 period. The higher average check was driven by an increase in menu prices and the mix of items sold.
License royalties were $31,824,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $31,368,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Total royalties earned on sales of hot dogs from our license agreement with John Morrell & Co. at retail and foodservice, substantially from sales of hot dogs to WalMart, increased to $28,970,000 for the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $28,694,000 for the fiscal 2021 period. The increase is due to a 0.3% increase in retail volume during the fiscal 2022 period, as well as a 1.1% increase in average net selling price as compared to the fiscal 2021 period. The foodservice business earned higher royalties of $147,000 as compared to the fiscal 2021 period. Royalties earned from all other licensing agreements for the manufacture and sale of Nathan’s products increased by $180,000 during the fiscal 2022 period as compared to the fiscal 2021 period primarily due to additional royalties earned on sales of proprietary spices, cocktail franks and mozzarella sticks, offset, in part, by lower royalties earned on French fries.
Franchise fees and royalties were $3,859,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $1,601,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Total royalties were $3,304,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $1,317,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Royalties earned under the Branded Menu Program were $580,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $220,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Royalties earned under the Branded Menu Program are not based upon a percentage of restaurant sales but are based upon product purchases. Ghost kitchen royalties were $318,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $49,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Traditional franchise royalties were $2,406,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $1,048,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Franchise restaurant sales increased to $52,319,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $22,269,000 in the fiscal 2021 primarily due to the reopening of a majority of our franchised locations. Comparable domestic franchise sales (consisting of 55 Nathan’s outlets, excluding sales under the Branded Menu Program) were $39,677,000 during the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $16,998,000 during the fiscal 2021 period.
At March 27, 2022, 239 franchised outlets, including domestic, international and Branded Menu Program outlets were operating compared to 213 franchised outlets, including domestic, international and Branded Menu Program outlets at March 28, 2021. Total franchise fee income was $555,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $284,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Domestic franchise fee income was $133,000 in the fiscal 2022 period and the fiscal 2021 period. International franchise fee income was $241,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $103,000 in the fiscal 2021 period.
We recognized $181,000 and $48,000 of forfeited fees in the fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 periods, respectively. During the fiscal 2022 period, 54 franchised outlets opened, including 37 new Branded Menu Program outlets. Additionally, 179 new virtual kitchens opened. During the fiscal 2021 period, seven franchised outlets opened, including two new Branded Menu Program outlets. Additionally, 130 new virtual kitchens opened.
Advertising fund revenue, after eliminating Company contributions, was $1,972,000 in the fiscal 2022 period and $1,544,000 during the fiscal 2021 period.
Costs and Expenses
Overall, our cost of sales increased by $32,628,000 to $65,164,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $32,536,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. Our gross profit (representing the difference between sales and cost of sales) was $12,063,000 or 15.6% of sales during the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $8,790,000 or 21.3% of sales during the fiscal 2021 period.
Cost of sales in the Branded Product Program increased by approximately $30,701,000 during the fiscal 2022 period as compared to the fiscal 2021 period, primarily due to the 78% increase in the volume of product sold as discussed above, as well as a 19% increase in the average cost per pound of our hot dogs. Beginning in July 2021, the cost of hot dogs has increased significantly due to higher costs for beef and beef trimmings, labor, packaging and transportation, as well as supply chain challenges associated with increased consumer demand as a result of the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not make any purchase commitments for beef during the fiscal 2022 and 2021 periods. If the cost of beef and beef trimmings increases and we are unable to pass on these higher costs through price increases or otherwise reduce any increase in our costs through the use of purchase commitments, our margins will be adversely impacted.
With respect to Company-owned restaurants, our cost of sales during the fiscal 2022 period was $7,222,000 or 66.2% of restaurant sales, as compared to $5,295,000 or 68.7% of restaurant sales in the fiscal 2021 period. The increase in cost of sales during the fiscal 2022 period was primarily due to the 41% increase in sales discussed above. The decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of total restaurant sales, was due to an increase in our average check, as well as an increase in customer counts which were offset by higher commodity costs and restaurant labor costs. The availability of labor remains a challenge at our Company-owned restaurants and it has required us to remain flexible as it relates to staffing levels and costs. Our labor costs were impacted by the additional increase in minimum wage requirements in New York State which commenced on July 1, 2021. Our food costs may be impacted by increases in commodity costs, as well as the mix of products that we sell.
Restaurant operating expenses increased by $391,000 to $3,659,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $3,268,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. We incurred higher occupancy expenses of $107,000, higher utility expenses of $55,000, higher repairs and maintenance expenses of $23,000, higher insurance expenses of $111,000 and higher delivery charges associated with offsite consumption.
Depreciation and amortization, which primarily consists of the depreciation of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and equipment, were $1,054,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $1,183,000 in the fiscal 2021 period.
General and administrative expenses increased $1,104,000 or 9% to $13,145,000 in the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $12,041,000 in the fiscal 2021 period. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a higher incentive compensation accrual of $432,000, higher insurance costs of $155,000 and higher marketing and trade show related expenses of $479,000.
Advertising fund expense, after eliminating Company contributions, was $1,997,000 in the fiscal 2022 period, as compared to $1,296,000 in the fiscal 2021 period.
Other Items
On January 26, 2022, the Company completed the partial redemption, in the principal amount of $40,000,000, of the 2025 Notes. In connection with the partial redemption, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1,354,000 that primarily reflected the redemption premium of $662,000 and the write-off of a portion of previously recorded debt issuance costs of $692,000.
Interest expense of $10,135,000 in fiscal 2022 represented accrued interest of $9,475,000 on the 2025 Notes and amortization of debt issuance costs of $660,000.
Interest expense of $10,601,000 in fiscal 2021 represented accrued interest of $9,910,000 on the 2025 Notes and amortization of debt issuance costs of $691,000.
Interest income was $110,000 for the fiscal 2022 period as compared to $364,000 in the fiscal 2021 period.
Other income, was $52,000 and $47,000 in the fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 periods, respectively, which primarily relates to sublease income from a franchised restaurant, offset, in part in fiscal 2022, by a termination fee associated with the Brooklyn Guaranty.
Provision for Income Taxes
The income tax provision for the fiscal 2022 period and fiscal 2021 period reflect effective tax rates of 26.7% and 27.7%, respectively.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at March 27, 2022 was $403,000 all of which would impact Nathan’s effective tax rate, if recognized. As of March 27, 2022, Nathan’s had $271,000 of accrued interest and penalties in connection with unrecognized tax benefits.
Nathan’s estimates that its unrecognized tax benefit excluding accrued interest and penalties could be further reduced by up to $16,000 during the fiscal year ending March 26, 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents at March 27, 2022 aggregated $50,063,000, a $31,001,000 decrease during the fiscal 2022 period as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $81,064,000 at March 28, 2021. Net working capital decreased to $48,988,000 from $80,072,000 at March 28, 2021 due primarily to the redemption of $40,000,000 of the Company’s 2025 Notes. Through March 27, 2022, the Company declared and paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating $6,173,000. During the fiscal 2022 period, the Company made its required semi-annual interest payments of $4,968,750 on May 1, 2021 and November 1, 2021, as well as its required interest payment of $626,000 on January 26, 2022 in connection with the partial redemption of its 2025 Notes. On May 1, 2022, we made the first semi-annual interest payment of fiscal 2023.
On December 15, 2021, the Company announced its intent to complete the partial redemption, in the principal amount of $40,000,000, of the 2025 Notes. On January 26, 2022, the Company completed the redemption by paying cash of $41,288,000, inclusive of the redemption premium and accrued interest, and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of approximately $1,354,000 that primarily reflected the redemption premium of $662,000 and the write-off of a portion of previously recorded debt issuance costs of $692,000. Please refer to Note J - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion regarding the Company’s indebtedness.
Cash provided by operations of $16,477,000 in the fiscal 2022 period is primarily attributable to net income of $13,596,000 in addition to other non-cash operating items of $2,751,000, and increases in changes in other operating assets and liabilities of $130,000. Non-cash operating expenses consist principally of a loss on debt extinguishment of $1,354,000, depreciation and amortization of $1,054,000, amortization of debt issuance costs of $660,000, share-based compensation expense of $74,000, bad debts of $186,000, offset by deferred income taxes of $444,000. In the fiscal 2022 period, accounts and other receivables increased by $1,908,000 due primarily to higher Branded Product Program receivables of $2,838,000 offset, in part, by lower franchise and license royalty receivables of $1,301,000. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by $116,000 due principally to an increase in prepaid marketing and other expenses of $473,000 offset, in part, by reductions in prepaid income taxes of $280,000, prepaid real estate taxes of $16,000 and prepaid insurance expenses of $61,000. Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $1,695,000 due principally to an increase in accrued payroll and other benefits of $316,000 due primarily to higher incentive compensation accruals; and an increase in accounts payable of $2,340,000 due to the timing of seasonal product purchases for our Branded Product Program. Offsetting these increases was a reduction in accrued interest expense of $1,089,000 due to the partial redemption of our 2025 Notes.
Cash used in investing activities was $636,000 in the fiscal 2022 period primarily in connection with capital expenditures incurred for our Branded Product Program and our Coney Island restaurants.
Cash used in financing activities of $46,842,000 in the fiscal 2022 period relates primarily to the payment of $40,000,000 in connection with the partial redemption of the 2025 Notes; the payment of the related redemption premium of $662,000; and the payments of the Company’s quarterly $0.35 per share cash dividends on June 25, 2021, September 3, 2021, December 3, 2021 and the Company’s quarterly $0.45 per share cash dividend on March 4, 2022 totaling $6,173,000.
At March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021, Nathan’s did not have any open purchase commitments to purchase hot dogs. Nathan’s may continue to enter into additional purchase commitments in the future as favorable market conditions become available.
During the period from October 2001 through March 27, 2022, Nathan’s purchased 5,254,081 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $84,770,000 pursuant to stock repurchase plans previously authorized by the Board. Since March 26, 2007, we have repurchased 3,362,981 shares at a total cost of approximately $77,612,000, reducing the number of shares then-outstanding by 55.9%.
In 2016, the Board authorized increases to the sixth stock repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to 1,200,000 shares of its common stock on behalf of the Company. As of March 27, 2022, Nathan’s has repurchased 1,066,450 shares at a cost of approximately $37,108,000 under the sixth stock repurchase plan. At March 27, 2022, there were 133,550 shares remaining to be repurchased pursuant to the sixth stock repurchase plan. The plan does not have a set expiration date. Purchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program may be made from time to time, depending on market conditions, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, at prices deemed appropriate by management. There is no set time limit on the repurchases.
As discussed above, we had cash and cash equivalents at March 27, 2022 aggregating $50,063,000. Our Board routinely monitors and assesses its cash position and our current and potential capital requirements. On May 31, 2018, the Board authorized the commencement of a regular dividend of $1.00 per share per annum, payable at the rate of $0.25 per share per quarter. On June 14, 2019, the Board authorized the increase of its regular quarterly dividend to $0.35 from $0.25. On February 4, 2022, the Board authorized the increase of its regular quarterly dividend to $0.45 from $0.35. During the fiscal 2022 period, we have declared and paid four quarterly dividend distributions totaling $6,173,000.
Effective June 10, 2022, the Board declared its first quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share for fiscal 2023 which is payable on June 24, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 20, 2022.
If the Company pays regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of fiscal 2023 at the same rate as declared in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company’s total cash requirement for dividends for all of fiscal 2023 would be approximately $7,407,000 based on the number of shares of its common stock outstanding at June 3, 2022. The Company currently intends to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any.
Our ability to pay future dividends is limited by the terms of the Indenture for the 2025 Notes. In addition, the payment of any cash dividends in the future, are subject to final determination of the Board and will be dependent upon our earnings and financial requirements. We may also return capital to our stockholders through stock repurchases, subject to any restrictions in the Indenture, although there is no assurance that the Company will make any repurchases under its existing stock repurchase plan.
We expect that in the future we will make investments in certain existing restaurants, support the growth of the Branded Product and Branded Menu Programs, service the outstanding debt, fund our dividend program and may continue our stock repurchase programs, funding those investments from our operating cash flow. We may also incur capital and other expenditures or engage in investing activities in connection with opportunistic situations that may arise on a case-by-case basis. In the fiscal year ending March 27, 2022, we were required to make interest payments of $10,563,000, all of which have been made as of January 26, 2022. During the fiscal year ending March 26, 2023, we will be required to make interest payments of $7,287,500. On May 1, 2022, we made the first semi-annual interest payment of fiscal 2023.
Management believes that available cash, cash equivalents, and cash generated from operations should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations, satisfy our debt service requirements, fund dividend distributions and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
At March 27, 2022, we sublet one property to a franchisee that we lease from a third party. We remain contingently liable for all costs associated with this property including: rent, property taxes and insurance. We may incur future cash payments with respect to such property, consisting primarily of future lease payments, including costs and expenses associated with terminating such lease.
Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the 2025 Notes and the related interest payments, operating leases, and employment agreement with certain executive officers. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since March 28, 2021 except for the partial redemption of the 2025 Notes discussed above.
On February 27, 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company executed a Guaranty of Lease (the “Brooklyn Guaranty”) in connection with its re-franchising of a restaurant located in Brooklyn, New York. The Company was obligated to make payments under the Brooklyn Guaranty in the event of a default by the tenant/franchisee. The Brooklyn Guaranty had an initial term of 10 years and one 5-year option and was limited to 24 months of rent for the first three years of the term. For the remainder of the term, the Brooklyn Guaranty was limited to 12 months of rent plus reasonable costs of collection and attorney’s fees. The Company entered into a termination of lease agreement effective January 15, 2022, subsequently amended and restated effective March 29, 2022. As consideration for all outstanding amounts due and payable under the Brooklyn Guaranty, the Company agreed to pay a termination fee in the amount of $75,000, of which the Company agreed to pay 50% or $37,500 and the tenant/franchisee agreed to pay 50% or $37,500. The Company paid its share of the termination fee in January 2022.
Inflationary Impact
Inflationary pressures on labor and rising commodity prices have directly impacted our consolidated results of operations during fiscal 2022, most notably within our restaurant operations and Branded Product Program segments. We expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2023. Our average cost of hot dogs between April 2021 and March 2022 was approximately 19% higher than between April 2020 and March 2021.
Beginning in July 2021, the cost of hot dogs has increased significantly due to higher costs for beef and beef trimmings, labor, packaging and transportation, as well as supply chain challenges associated with increased consumer demand as a result of the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are unable to predict the future cost of our hot dogs and expect to experience price volatility for our beef products during fiscal 2023. To the extent that beef prices increase as compared to earlier periods, it could impact our results of operations. In the past, we have entered into purchase commitments for a portion of our hot dogs to reduce the impact of increasing market prices. Our most recent purchase commitment was completed in 2016 for approximately 2,600,000 pounds of hot dogs. We may attempt to enter into similar purchase arrangements for hot dogs and other products in the future. Additionally, we expect to continue experiencing volatility in oil and gas prices on our distribution costs for our food products and utility costs in the Company-owned restaurants and volatile insurance costs resulting from rising rates.
New York State passed legislation increasing the minimum hourly wage for fast food workers of restaurant chains with 30 or more locations nationwide. The increase was phased in differently between New York City and the rest of New York State. Effective December 31, 2019, the minimum wage was $15.00 in New York City and increased to $13.75 per hour for the remainder of New York State. The minimum hourly rate of pay for the remainder of New York State increased to $14.50 on December 31, 2020 and increased to $15.00 on July 1, 2021. All of Nathan’s Company-owned restaurants are within New York State and have been affected by this new legislation.
Continued increases in labor costs, commodity prices and other operating expenses, including health care, could adversely affect our operations. We attempt to manage inflationary pressures and rising commodity costs, at least in part, through raising prices. Delays in implementing price increases may limit our ability to offset these rising costs. Volatility in commodity prices, including beef and beef trimmings could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.
We believe the increases in the minimum wage and other changes in employment laws have had a significant financial impact on our financial results and the results of our franchisees that operate in New York State. Our business could be negatively impacted if the decrease in margins for our franchisees results in the potential loss of new franchisees or the closing of a significant number of franchised restaurants.
The Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to those set forth above in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, also see the discussions in “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors”, and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Form 10-K.
