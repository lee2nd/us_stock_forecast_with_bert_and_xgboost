See “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. The following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Business Update
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we continued to see recovery in the environment in which our business operates, albeit in some markets and regions more or less than others. The increased availability of vaccinations and the reductions in travel and business restrictions appeared to drive increased economic activity, including the opening of many businesses and schools, as well as more in-person interaction broadly. Demand for gasoline and distillates, excluding jet fuel, have returned to near 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Permanent remote work and teleconferencing arrangements may continue to impact demand for our refined products. While we have seen improved results through 2021, we are unable to predict the potential effects that further resurgences of COVID-19 may have on our financial position and results.
In response to this business environment, we continue to focus on the following priorities for our business:
Strengthen Competitive Position of Assets
We are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational, financial, and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. Our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. With our investments we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves.
Improve Commercial Performance
We are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions, and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance. A near-term focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities. This includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain.
Continued Capital Discipline and Focus on Low-Cost Culture
We are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation. This means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be disciplined in every dollar we spend across our organization. We look to optimize our portfolio of investment opportunities to ensure efficient deployment of capital focusing on projects with the highest returns.
In connection with our commitment to lower cost and strengthen the competitive position of our assets, in the third quarter of 2020, we announced strategic actions to lay a foundation for long-term success, including plans to optimize our assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond. These actions included indefinitely idling the Gallup refinery, initiating actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and the approval of an involuntary workforce reduction plan. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect the favorable effects from these cost reduction actions.
Many uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from COVID-19 and how quickly the U.S. and economies around the world can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides. However, the adverse impact of the economic effects on MPC have been and may continue to be significant.
Commitment to Sustainability
Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social and governance dimensions of our business. That means strengthening resiliency by lowering the carbon intensity and conserving natural resources; innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies; and embedding sustainability in decision-making and in how we engage our people and many stakeholders. Specifically, we established a 2030 target to reduce our absolute Scope 3 - Category 11 GHG emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. Additionally, MPLX established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity by 75% below 2016 levels. The reduction target applies to MPLX’s natural gas gathering and processing operations and represents an expansion of the existing 2025 target, established in 2020, to reduce methane emissions intensity by 50% below 2016 levels.
Strategic Updates
On February 2, 2022, we announced our board of directors approved an incremental $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, MPC had $5.27 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorizations prior to this additional authorization.
On December 14, 2021, we finalized the formation of a joint venture with Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (“ADM”) for the production of soybean oil to supply rapidly growing demand for renewable diesel fuel. The joint venture, which is named Green Bison Soy Processing, LLC, will own and operate a soybean processing complex in Spiritwood, North Dakota, with ADM owning 75 percent of the joint venture and MPC owning 25 percent. When complete in 2023, the Spiritwood facility will source and process local soybeans and supply the resulting soybean oil exclusively to MPC. The Spiritwood complex is expected to produce approximately 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil annually, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year.
On May 14, 2021, we completed the sale of Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven for cash proceeds of $21.38 billion. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $11.68 billion ($8.02 billion after income taxes) after deducting the book value of the net assets and certain other adjustments. MPC remains committed to executing its plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.
In connection with the Speedway sale, our board of directors approved an additional $7.1 billion share repurchase authorization bringing total share repurchase authorizations to $10.0 billion prior to the June tender offer discussed below.
•During 2021, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer discussed below, MPC repurchased approximately 76 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $4.65 billion of cash, with an additional $85 million of cash paid in the first quarter of 2022 in connection with the settlement of certain late December repurchases.
•During the second quarter of 2021, MPC completed a modified Dutch auction tender offer, purchasing 15,573,365 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $63.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $981 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer.
During 2021, we reduced debt through the following actions:
•On December 2, 2021, all of the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC's 4.5% senior notes due May 2023 and the $850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 4.75% senior notes due December 2023, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor LLC was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par, plus a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. MPC funded the redemption amount with cash on hand.
•In June 2021,we redeemed all of the $300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due April 2024 at a price equal to 100.854% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
•In May 2021, we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which, along with cash, had been used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of MPC’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of $1.13 billion.
•On March 1, 2021, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due March 2021.
On February 24, 2021, we announced our plan to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Converting the Martinez facility from refining petroleum to manufacturing renewable fuels signals our strong commitment to producing a substantial level of lower carbon-intensity fuels in California. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with pretreatment capabilities coming online in 2023. The facility is expected to be capable of producing approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.
The Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable fuels facility began operations at the end of 2020 and reached full design operating capacity in the second quarter of 2021. The facility has the capacity to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn oil, soybean oil, fats, and greases. The produced renewable diesel generates federal RINs and LCFS credits when sold in California or similar markets. These instruments are used to help meet our Renewable Fuel Standard and LCFS compliance obligations as a petroleum fuel producer.
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective income tax rate is affected by the weighting of income from our wholly owned operations versus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, tax rate differences can arise from non-forecasted discrete items. During operating environments when refining margins approximate historical averages, we generally expect our effective tax rate to be between 18 percent and 21 percent, excluding discrete tax items. A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate of 21 percent to our
effective tax rate of 9 percent for the period ended December 31, 2021 is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note14.
Results
Select results for continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 are reflected in the following table.
(a)Includes LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million for 2020.
(b)2021 includes impairment expenses related to long-lived assets and equity method investments. 2020 includes impairments of goodwill, equity method investments and long-lived assets.
(c)2020 restructuring expenses include $195 million for exit costs related to the Martinez and Gallup refineries and $172 million of employee separation costs.
(d)2020 includes costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review.
Select results for discontinued operations are reflected in the following table.
(a)Costs related to the Speedway separation.
The following table includes net income (loss) per diluted share data.
Net income attributable to MPC increased $19.56 billion, or $30.37 per diluted share, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sale of Speedway, the absence of impairment expenses and a LIFO liquidation charge and increases in average refined product sales prices and volumes, partially offset by a partial period of income from discontinued operations due to the sale of the Speedway business on May 14, 2021.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations.
Refer to the Results of Operations section for a discussion of financial results by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2021.
MPLX
We received limited partner distributions of $2.16 billion and $1.79 billion from MPLX during 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to a special distribution amount of $0.5750 per common unit in the third quarter of 2021. We owned approximately 647 million MPLX common units at December 31, 2021 with a market value of $19.16 billion based on the December 31, 2021 closing unit price of $29.59. On January 25, 2022, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.7050 per common unit, which was paid February 14, 2022. As a result, MPLX made distributions totaling $715 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of this distribution was approximately $456 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, MPLX repurchased 23 million common units at an average cost per unit of $27.52 and paid $630 million of cash. As of December 31, 2021, $337 million remained available under the authorization for future repurchases.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.
OVERVIEW OF SEGMENTS
Refining & Marketing
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing margin, refining operating costs, refining planned turnarounds, distribution costs, depreciation expenses and refinery throughputs. Our total refining capacity was 2,887 mbpcd, 2,874 mbpcd and 3,067 mbpcd as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. The following will be used for these crack-spread calculations:
•The Gulf Coast crack spread uses three barrels of MEH crude producing two barrels of USGC CBOB gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD. In the first quarter of 2021, we transitioned to MEH crude from LLS crude;
•The Mid-Continent crack spread uses three barrels of WTI crude producing two barrels of Chicago CBOB gasoline and one barrel of Chicago ULSD; and
•The West Coast crack spread uses three barrels of ANS crude producing two barrels of LA CARBOB and one barrel of LA CARB Diesel.
Our refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads. The amount of these discounts, which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads. In general, larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.
Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.
The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.
(a)Crack spread based on 40 percent MEH, 40 percent WTI and 20 percent ANS with Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast product pricing, respectively, and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.
(b)Sour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: ANS, Argus Sour Crude Index, Maya and Western Canadian Select. We assume approximately 50 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2022 will be sour crude.
(c)Sweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: Bakken, Brent, MEH, WTI-Cushing and WTI-Midland. We assume approximately 50 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2022 will be sweet crude.
(d)This is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our Midstream segment.
In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:
•the selling prices realized for refined products;
•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;
•our refinery yields;
•the cost of products purchased for resale;
•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;
•the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices: and
•the potential impact of LIFO liquidation charges due to draw-downs from historic inventory levels.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. At December 31, 2021, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs in addition to committed distribution costs. Changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Refining planned turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Distribution costs primarily include long-term agreements with MPLX, as discussed below, which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled.
The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years.
We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX. Under these agreements, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our Refining & Marketing segment. Certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. Certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets.
Midstream
Our Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products, principally for our Refining & Marketing segment. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. The profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment. Our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment.
As discussed above in the Refining & Marketing section, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment. Under these agreements, MPLX has received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer
driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.
Our Midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and NGLs. NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our Midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third-party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index-related prices and the cost of third-party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.
Consolidated Results of Operations
(a)In accordance with discontinued operations accounting, Speedway sales to retail customers and net results are reflected in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and Refining & Marketing intercompany sales to Speedway are presented as third-party sales through the close of the sale on May 14, 2021.
2021 Compared to 2020
Net income attributable to MPC increased $19.56 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the gain on the sale of Speedway, the absence of impairment expenses and a LIFO liquidation charge and increases in average refined product sales
prices and volumes, partially offset by a partial period of income from discontinued operations due to the sale of the Speedway business on May 14, 2021. See Segment Results for additional information.
Total revenues and other income increased $51.90 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to:
•increased sales and other operating revenues of $50.20 billion primarily due to increased average refined product sales prices of $0.80 per gallon, or 65 percent, and refined product sales volumes of 203 mbpd, or 6 percent, largely due to continuing economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020;
•increased income from equity method investments of $1.39 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion in 2020 primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices; and
•increased other income of $350 million primarily due to higher income on RIN sales.
Total costs and expenses increased $35.35 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to:
•increased cost of revenues of $44.28 billion primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes in addition to higher crude oil and refined product raw material costs, partially offset by the absence of a LIFO liquidation charge in 2020 of $561 million;
•decreased impairment expense of $8.43 billion due to impairments recorded for goodwill and long-lived assets in 2020 primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices in the prior year;
•decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $173 million mainly due to cost reductions realized from our 2020 workforce reduction and other cost control efforts; and
•decreased restructuring expenses of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction in 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 for additional information.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $118 million largely due to debt retirement expenses related to the redemption of MPC senior notes and pension settlement losses of $75 million, partially offset by decreased interest expense due to lower MPLX and MPC borrowings. We capitalized interest of $73 million in 2021 and $129 million in 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 for further details.
We recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $264 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was lower than the tax computed at the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to certain permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a change in benefit related to the net operating loss (“NOL”) carryback provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), partially offset by state taxes. We recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax benefit of $2.43 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is lower than the tax computed at the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the NOL carryback provided under the CARES Act. Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 for further details.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $1.40 billion mainly due to an increase in MPLX’s net income largely due to impairment expense recognized during 2020.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net income attributable to MPC decreased $12.46 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to impairment expenses for goodwill and long-lived assets of $8.43 billion, impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion, decreased refined product sales volumes, prices and margin, a charge of $561 million to reflect a LIFO liquidation in our crude oil and refined product inventories and restructuring expenses of $367 million. These changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income from discontinued operations, which represents the Speedway business. See Segment Results for additional information.
Total revenues and other income decreased $42.83 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:
•decreased sales and other operating revenues of $41.37 billion primarily due to decreased Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, or 14 percent, and lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.55 per gallon, or 31 percent, largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;
•decreased income from equity method investments of $1.25 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion primarily driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in commodity prices; and
•decreased net gain on disposal of assets of $208 million mainly due to the absence of $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline Pipeline Company LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019. This decrease was offset by net gains on disposal of assets in 2020 largely due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets.
Total costs and expenses decreased $26.12 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:
•decreased cost of revenues of $33.50 billion primarily due to reduced business operations and travel associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $561 million to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in the LIFO liquidation charge;
•impairment expense of $8.43 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and long-lived assets of $7.39 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices. It also includes impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to the repositioning of the Martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of $1.20 billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition;
•decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses;
•restructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 for additional information; and
•increased other taxes of $107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately $78 million and $69 million, respectively. Property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 for further details.
Provision for income taxes on continuing operations decreased $3.21 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of $16.85 billion. The effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected NOL carryback provided under the CARES Act. Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 for further details.
Noncontrolling interests decreased $769 million mainly due to MPLX’s net loss primarily resulting from impairment expense recognized during 2020.
Segment Results
Our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segment income (loss) from continuing operations was approximately $5.08 billion, $(1.48) billion and $6.45 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Refining & Marketing
The following includes key financial and operating data for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
(a)Includes intersegment sales to Midstream and sales destined for export.
(a)Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by net refinery throughput.
(b)See “Non-GAAP Measures” section for reconciliation and further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.
(c)Includes refining operating and major maintenance costs. Excludes planned turnaround and depreciation and amortization expense.
(d)Storms in the first and third quarters of 2021 resulted in higher costs, including maintenance and repairs.
(e)Reflects a benefit of $93 million in 2019 for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018.
(f)Includes income from equity method investments, net gain on disposal of assets and other income.
The following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment. The benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of RINs necessary to meet EPA renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the Renewable Fuel Standard.
(a)The blended crack spreads for 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 are weighted 40 percent of the USGC crack spread, 40 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 20 percent of the West Coast crack spread. The blended crack spreads for the first three quarters of 2020 and all of 2019 are weighted 38 percent of the USGC crack spread, 38 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 24 percent of the West Coast crack spread. These blends are based on MPC’s refining capacity by region in each period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, the prompt price for USGC was transitioned from LLS to MEH.
2021 Compared to 2020
Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $49.25 billion primarily due to increased average refined product sales prices of $0.80 per gallon and higher refined product sales volumes, which increased 203 mbpd.
Refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 91 percent during 2021 and net refinery throughputs increased 216 mbpd primarily due to continuing economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $6.21 billion primarily driven by higher blended crack spreads.
Refining & Marketing margin, excluding LIFO liquidation charge, was $13.36 per barrel for 2021 compared to $8.96 per barrel for 2020. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net positive impact of $5.0 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to higher crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $700 million, including the LIFO liquidation charge, in 2021 compared to 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and storm impacts, were $5.13 billion. This was a decrease of $241 million, or $0.66 per barrel, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including idling portions of our refining capacity, partially offset by an increase in energy costs largely as a result of higher natural gas prices.
Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.15 billion and $5.08 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.47 billion and $3.46 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a per barrel basis, distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased $0.33 due to increased throughput.
Refining planned turnaround costs decreased $250 million, or $0.31 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity and an increase in throughput.
Depreciation and amortization per barrel decreased by $0.13, primarily due to an increase in throughput partially offset by an increase in costs.
We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $1.49 billion in 2021 and $606 million in 2020 and are included in Refining & Marketing margin. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs.
2020 Compared to 2019
Refining & Marketing segment revenues decreased $41.16 billion primarily due to lower refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, and decreased average refined product sales prices of $0.55 per gallon.
Refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 82 percent during 2020 and net refinery throughputs decreased 529 mbpd primarily due to reducing throughputs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $8.05 billion primarily driven by lower blended crack spreads.
Refining & Marketing margin, excluding LIFO liquidation charge, was $8.96 per barrel for 2020 compared to $14.77 per barrel for 2019. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net negative impact of $9.75 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to lower crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $800 million, including the LIFO liquidation charge, in 2020 compared to 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.37 billion. This was a decrease of $1.06 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.02 due to lower refinery throughput, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity. Net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020.
Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.08 billion and $5.13 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.46 billion and $3.22 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a per barrel basis, distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $0.85 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs.
Refining planned turnaround costs increased $92 million, or $0.23 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput.
Depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.38, primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs.
We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $606 million in 2020 and $356 million in 2019 and are included in Refining & Marketing margin. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs, partially offset by a decrease in our RIN obligations.

2021 Compared to 2020
Midstream segment revenue and segment income from operations increased $1.18 billion and $353 million, respectively. Results benefited from higher revenue, primarily due to higher natural gas prices, higher pipeline and terminal throughputs and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marine transportation fees.
2020 Compared to 2019
Midstream segment revenue decreased $322 million primarily due to decreased demand for the products that we produce and transport due to macro-economic conditions in 2020 in addition to lower natural gas prices.
In 2020, Midstream segment income from operations increased $114 million mainly due to stable, fee-based earnings in the 2020 business environment, contributions from organic growth projects and reduced operating expenses.
Corporate
(a)Corporate costs consist primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX, which are included in the Midstream segment.
2021 Compared to 2020
Corporate expenses decreased $104 million in 2021 compared to 2020 largely due to cost reductions realized from our 2020 workforce reduction and other cost control efforts.
2020 Compared to 2019
Corporate expenses decreased $33 million in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to decreased salaries and contract services expenses, partially offset by increased expenses due to an information systems integration project. 2020 and 2019 corporate expenses include expenses of $26 million and $28 million, respectively, which are no longer allocable to Speedway due to discontinued operations accounting.
Items not Allocated to Segments
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments using segment income from operations. Items identified in the table below are either believed to be non-recurring in nature or not believed to be allocable, controlled by the segment or are not tied to the operational performance of the segment.
(a)2020 and 2019 include costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. 2019 includes employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations.
2021 Compared to 2020
Total items not allocated to segments included impairment expense of $81 million related to the divestiture, abandonment or closure of certain assets within our Midstream segment.
Unallocated items in 2020 include impairment charges of $9.74 billion which includes $8.43 billion related to goodwill and long-lived assets and $1.32 billion related to equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 for additional information.
During 2020, we indefinitely idled our Gallup refinery, initiated actions to strategically reposition our Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and approved an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 for additional information.
Other unallocated items in 2020 include a favorable litigation settlement of $84 million and gain on sale of assets of $66 million related to the sale of three asphalt terminals and certain other Refining & Marketing assets.

Impairment charges of $1.24 billion in 2019 primarily relate to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Management uses a financial measure to evaluate our operating performance that is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, it provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. This measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measure we use is as follows:
Refining & Marketing Margin
Refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes other items reflected in the table below.
Reconciliation of Refining & Marketing income (loss) from operations to Refining & Marketing gross margin and Refining & Marketing margin
(a)Reflects the gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, of other related operations included in the Refining & Marketing segment and processing of credit card transactions on behalf of certain of our marketing customers, net of other income.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Our cash and cash equivalents balance for continuing operations was $5.29 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $415 million at December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations was $140 million at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table.
Operating Activities
Continuing Operations
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $7.58 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase in operating results and a favorable change in working capital of $633 million. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $7.17 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results and an unfavorable change in working capital of $43 million. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
For 2021, changes in working capital were a net $947 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes at the end of the year on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to increases in crude prices and volumes. Current receivables increased primarily due to higher crude and refined product prices and volumes.
For 2020, changes in working capital were a net $314 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices, inventory and refined product volumes on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude payable prices. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude and refined product receivable prices and refined product volumes. Inventories decreased mainly due to decreases in refined product, crude and materials and supplies inventories.
For 2019, changes in working capital were a net $357 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices and volumes. Current receivables increased primarily due to increases in crude and refined product receivable volumes and prices. Inventories increased primarily due to increases in refined product and materials and supplies inventories partially offset by a decrease in crude inventory.
Discontinued Operations
Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was $4.02 billion in 2021 primarily due to tax payments related to the sale of Speedway, partially offset by a partial year of business income due to the sale of Speedway on May 14, 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 and 2019 include Speedway business income.
Investing Activities
Continuing Operations
Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were $6.52 billion, $2.92 billion and $5.78 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•In 2021, proceeds from the sale of Speedway were used to purchase $12.50 billion of short-term investments and cash of $5.41 billion and $1.54 billion was provided by the maturities and sales, respectively, of short-term investments. The cash provided by maturities and sales of short-term investments was primarily used to fund our return of capital initiatives announced as part of the Speedway sale.
•Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment was $1.46 billion in 2021, compared to $2.79 billion in 2020 and $4.81 billion in 2019, primarily due to spending in our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments in 2021. See discussion of capital expenditures and investments under the “Capital Spending” section.
•Net investments were a use of cash of $171 million in 2021 compared to $348 million in 2020 and $966 million in 2019. Investments in 2021 primarily include midstream projects and our joint venture with ADM. The decrease from 2020 is due to the completion of the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the Gray Oak Pipeline and the Whistler Pipeline projects which were included in 2020 net investments. Investments in 2019 are largely due to investments in connection with the Gray Oak Pipeline, which began initial start-up in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Wink to Webster Pipeline, the Whistler Pipeline and other Midstream projects.
•Cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $153 million, $150 million and $47 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we primarily sold Midstream assets and in 2020, we sold three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets.
The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years.
Discontinued Operations
Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 primarily includes the $21.38 billion proceeds from the sale of Speedway, partially offset primarily by cash used for Speedway capital expenditures of $177 million. Net cash used in investing activities for discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019 primarily includes Speedway capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Financing activities were a use of cash of $14.42 billion in 2021, $135 million in 2020 and $3.38 billion in 2019.
•During 2021,we reduced debt through the following actions:
•On December 2, 2021, all of the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC's 4.5% senior notes due May 2023 and the $850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 4.75% senior notes due December 2023, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor LLC was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par, plus a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. MPC funded the redemption amount with cash on hand.
•In June 2021,we redeemed all of the $300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due April 2024 at a price equal to 100.854% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
•In May 2021, we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which, along with cash had been used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of MPC’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of $1.13 billion.
•On March 1, 2021, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due March 2021.
•In 2021, MPLX redeemed $1.75 billion of senior notes and had net borrowings of $300 million under its revolving credit facility.
•During 2020, MPC issued $2.5 billion of senior notes, redeemed $1.13 billion of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.23 billion under its revolving credit facility and borrowed and repaid $3.55 billion under its trade receivables facility. MPLX issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, which were used to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under its term loan, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and to redeem $750 million of fixed rate senior notes, and had net borrowings of $175 million under its revolving credit facility.
•During 2019, MPLX issued $2.0 billion of floating rate notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay various outstanding MPLX borrowings and for general business purposes, and had net borrowings of $1.0 billion under its term loan agreement. In addition, MPLX repaid $500 million of senior notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for additional information on our long-term debt.
•Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $4.65 billion in 2021 and $1.95 billion in 2019. See the “Capital Requirements” section for further discussion of our stock repurchases.
•Cash used in dividend payments totaled $1.48 billion in 2021, $1.51 billion in 2020 and $1.40 billion in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to an increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases in 2019. Dividends per share were $2.32 in 2021, $2.32 in 2020 and $2.12 in 2019.
•Cash used in distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $1.45 billion in 2021, $1.24 billion in 2020 and $1.25 billion in 2019. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to an increase in MPLX’s distribution per common unit, mainly due to a special distribution amount of $0.5750 per common unit in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by a reduction of MPLX common units resulting from common unit repurchases in 2021 and 2020.
•Cash used in repurchases of noncontrolling interests increased $597 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to MPLX’s repurchases of its common units. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.
