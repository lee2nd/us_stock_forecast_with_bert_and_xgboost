ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Overview
Ideal Power is located in Austin, Texas.
We are solely focused on the further development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ solid-state switch technology.
To date, operations have been funded primarily through the sale of common stock and warrants and we have generated $3.5 million in grant revenue for bidirectional power switch development. Grant revenue was $576,399 and $428,129 in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We may pursue additional research and development grants, if and when available, to further develop and/or improve our technology. We are in the process of commercializing our B-TRAN™ technology.
Trends, Events and Uncertainties
Research and Development
Research and development of new technologies is, by its nature, unpredictable. We cannot assure you that our research and development will be successful, our technology will be adopted, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds if and when we need them, we may be required to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations.
COVID-19 Impact
As of the date of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial performance will depend on future developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of COVID-19 and its related variants, the timing, scope and efficacy of vaccination efforts, additional governmental restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the COVID-19 pandemic contributes to significant volatility in the global financial markets in the
future, our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all, may be impacted, though such risk has not materialized to date. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are negatively impacted for an extended period, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused some disruption to our business, particularly in the first and second quarters of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our operations to date. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business in the future and cause delays in critical development and commercialization activities and/or result in potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate spread of the virus and its related variants, the duration of the pandemic, the timing, scope and efficacy of vaccination efforts and additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, makes it difficult to forecast the effects on our business and results of operations for 2022 and thereafter. See “Item 1A: Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Company - Our business, including our supply chain, liquidity, financial condition and financial results may be adversely disrupted and impacted due to COVID-19 pandemic.”
Public Offering
In February 2021, we received net proceeds from the Public Offering of $21.2 million, as discussed in more detail below.
Early Warrant Exercise Transaction
In August 2020, we closed the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction (as defined below), pursuant to which we raised net proceeds of $2.5 million, as discussed in more detail below.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates may be based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and/or information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Footnote 2 to our financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.
Stock-Based Compensation. We apply FASB ASC 718, “Stock Compensation,” when recording stock-based compensation. Grants to non-employees are also accounted for under ASC 718. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the commonly used Black-Scholes option valuation model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
Grant Price - The grant price is determined based on the closing share price on the date of grant.
Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US Treasury securities at the time of grant with an equivalent term of the expected life of the award.
Expected lives - As permitted by SAB 107, due to our insufficient history of option activity, we utilize the simplified approach to estimate the options’ expected term, calculated as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the award.
Expected volatility - Volatility is estimated based on the historical volatilities of comparable companies.
Expected dividend yield - Dividend yield is based on current yield at the grant date or the average dividend yield over the historical period. We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets are composed of patents, which are recorded at cost, and other intangible assets, which are recorded at cost plus the estimated present value of all future payments associated with the other intangible assets. We capitalize third-party legal costs and filing fees, if any, associated with obtaining patents or other intangible assets. Once the patent asset has been placed in service, we amortize these costs over the shorter of the asset’s legal life, generally 20 years from the initial filing date, or its estimated economic life using the straight-line method. For the other intangible assets, we amortize the asset over the 17-year term of the underlying agreements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The long-lived assets, consisting of property and equipment and intangible assets, held and used by us are reviewed for impairment no less frequently than annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed. We determined that there was an impairment in the value of long-lived assets in the amount of $528 and $20,660 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.
We have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient foreseeable taxable income within the carryforward period as applicable and permitted by current law to allow for the utilization of certain of the deductible amounts generating the deferred tax assets; therefore, a full valuation allowance has been established to reduce the net deferred tax assets to zero at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020
Grant Revenues. Grant revenues increased by $148,270 to $576,399 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $428,129 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The grant revenues relate primarily to a $1.2 million subcontract with Diversified Technologies, Inc. (“DTI”) to supply B-TRAN™ devices as part of a two-year contract awarded to DTI by the United States Naval Sea Systems Command (“NAVSEA”) for the development and demonstration of a B-TRAN™ enabled high efficiency direct current solid-state circuit breaker (“SSCB”). The program started in late June 2020. In September 2021, we entered into and began work under a $50,000 subcontract with DTI under a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research grant from the Department of Energy to develop a B-TRAN™-driven low loss alternating current SSCB. We expect the grant revenue related to these subcontracts to continue over the first half of 2022 with minimal revenue recognized thereafter through completion of the NAVSEA demonstration. We also expect to pursue additional government funding that may result in additional grant revenues in the future.
We expect to introduce our initial product for commercial sale in the second half of 2022.
Cost of Grant Revenues. Cost of grant revenues increased by $148,270 from $576,399 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $428,129 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cost of grant revenues relates to the subcontracts discussed above and are equal to the associated grant revenues resulting in no gross profit. We expect no gross profit under the subcontracts with DTI or other grants that we are pursuing, or may pursue, in 2022.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased by $206,850, or 12%, to $1,927,743 in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1,720,893 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher contract labor for device and driver development and the expansion of internal test capabilities of $304,000, personnel costs of $225,093, and other B-TRAN™ spending of $65,441, partly offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $387,684. We expect higher research and development expenses in 2022 as we accelerate development of our B-TRAN™ technology and self-fund, at least in the short term, development previously funded through government grants.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $101,336 or 4%, to $2,408,425 in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2,307,089 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher investor relations spending of $243,497, professional services paid in stock of $207,980 and higher other costs of $15,759, partly offset by lower stock-based compensation costs of $227,932, as a majority of stock option grants in 2020 vested immediately, and chief executive officer search fees of $137,968 in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect slightly higher general and administrative expenses in 2022.
Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $512,807 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $40,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to the hiring of a Vice President of Business Development in the first quarter of 2021 and subsequent spending as we work towards commercializing our B-TRAN™ technology. The increase included personnel costs of $282,734, stock-based compensation expense of $99,281 and all other sales and marketing costs of $90,792. We expect higher sales and marketing expenses in 2022 as we engage more broadly with prospective customers and commercialize our B-TRAN™ technology.
Loss from Operations. Our loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,848,975 or 19% higher than the $4,067,982 loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by the factors discussed above.
Other Income (Expenses). Other income was $78,706 for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a $91,407 gain on the forgiveness of our PPP Loan (as defined below) partly offset by interest expense of $12,701. Other expenses were $3,725,915 for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to non-cash warrant inducement expense of $3,720,866 in connection with the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction (as defined below) and interest expense of $5,049.
Net Loss. Our net loss decreased by $3,023,628, or 39%, to $4,770,269 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from a net loss of $7,793,897 for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the reasons discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We currently generate grant revenue only. We expect to generate grant revenue and potentially commercial revenue in 2022. We have incurred losses since inception. We have funded our operations to date through the sale of common stock and warrants.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $23,170,149 and $3,157,256, respectively. Our net working capital and long-term debt at December 31, 2021 were $22,904,440 and $0, respectively.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets could each impact our business and liquidity.
Operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in cash outflows of $4,280,864, which were due to the net loss for the period of $4,770,269, unfavorable balance sheet timing of $137,573 and a non-cash gain on the forgiveness of our PPP Loan of $91,407, partly offset by other non-cash items including stock-based compensation of $352,313, stock issued for services of $207,980, depreciation and amortization of $157,564 and patent impairment charges of $528.
Operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in cash outflows of $3,019,032, which were due to the net loss for the period of $7,793,897 and slightly unfavorable balance sheet timing of $7,461, partly offset by non-cash items including warrant inducement expense of $3,720,866, stock-based compensation of $868,648, depreciation and amortization of $122,152, stock issued for services of $50,000 and patent impairment charges of $20,660.
We expect an increase in cash outflows from operating activities in 2022 as we accelerate development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology.
Investing activities in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 resulted in cash outflows of $236,935 and $67,160, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash outflows for the acquisition of intangible assets were $192,668 and capital expenditures were $44,267. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash outflows for the acquisition of intangible assets were $53,220 and capital expenditures were $13,940.
Financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in cash inflows of $21,204,609 from the net proceeds from our Public Offering and $3,326,083 from the exercise of warrants and stock options. Financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in cash inflows of $3,185,766 and included proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $3,094,359 and proceeds from loans of $91,407.
PPP Loan
In May 2020, we entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (collectively the “PPP Loan”) with BBVA USA pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). We received total proceeds of $91,407 from the unsecured PPP Loan. The PPP Loan was scheduled to mature in May 2022 and had an interest rate of 1.00% per annum and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act and the PPP, we used the proceeds from the PPP Loan primarily for payroll costs. We applied for forgiveness of the PPP Loan during the first quarter of 2021. In May 2021, the SBA approved forgiveness of our PPP Loan.
Early Warrant Exercise Transaction
In July 2020, we entered into letter agreements (the “Letter Agreements”) with certain of our Series A warrant holders (the “Series A Warrant Holders”), who were previously issued warrants (the “Original Warrants”) to purchase shares of our common stock in a private placement. The Series A Warrant Holders agreed to the early exercise of their Original Warrants pursuant to the Letter Agreements (the “Early Warrant Exercise Transaction”). The transaction closed in August 2020. We raised net proceeds of $2.5 million in the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction.We utilized the net proceeds from the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes.
Pursuant to the Letter Agreements, in consideration of the Series A Warrant Holders exercising Original Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,176,137 shares of common stock, we issued to the Series A Warrant Holders new Series C warrants (the “New Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 705,688 shares of common stock, which is equal to 60% of the shares underlying the Original Warrants included in the transaction. The New Warrants have an exercise price of $8.90 per share and an expiration date of August 4, 2025. The estimated fair value of the New Warrants was $3.7 million on the date of issuance and was recognized as a non-cash warrant inducement expense within other income (expenses) in our statement of operations.
Public Offering
In February 2021, we issued and sold 1,352,975 shares of our common stock, including 176,475 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares in full, at a price of $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the Public Offering were $21.2 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Public Offering to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Lease
In March 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for 4,070 square feet of office and laboratory space located in Austin, Texas. The commencement of the lease occurred on June 1, 2021 and the initial term of the lease was 63 months. The actual base rent in the first year of the lease was $56,471 and was net of $18,824 in abated rent over the first three months of the lease term. The annual base rent in the second year of the lease is $77,330 and increases by $2,035 in each succeeding year of the lease. In addition, we are required to pay our proportionate share of operating costs for the building under this triple net lease. The lease contains a 5-year fair market renewal option. It does not contain a termination option. We recognized a right of use asset of $339,882 and a corresponding lease liability for this lease upon lease commencement.
Future minimum payments under the lease are as follows:
Licensing Agreements
In 2015, we entered into licensing agreements which expire in February 2033. Per the agreements, we have an exclusive royalty-free license associated with semiconductor power switches which enhances our intellectual property portfolio. The agreements include both fixed payments, all of which were paid prior to 2017, and ongoing variable payments. The variable payments are a function of the number of associated patent filings pending and patents issued under the agreements. We will pay $10,000 for each patent filing pending and $20,000 for each patent issued annually with one-half of the annual payment due within 20 days of December 21st of each year and one-half of the annual payment due within 20 days of June 21st of each year of the agreements, up to a maximum of $100,000 each year (i.e. five issued patents).
In March 2021, two patents associated with these agreements were issued and we recorded, as a non-cash activity, an intangible asset and a corresponding other long-term liability of $426,937, representing the estimated present value of future payments under the licensing agreements for these two issued patents. As of March 2021, all five patents associated with the agreements were issued and, as a result, the annual payment amount through expiration of the licensing agreements is $100,000. At December 31, 2021, the corresponding long-term liability for the estimated present value of future payments under the licensing agreement was $917,100. We are accruing interest for future payments related to the issued patents associated with the agreement.
