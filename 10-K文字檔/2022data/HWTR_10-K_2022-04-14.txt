Company History and Summary
HFactor, Inc., formerly known as Ficaar, Inc. (the “Company” or “HFactor” or “Ficaar”) was incorporated in July 2001 in the State of Georgia under the name OwnerTel, Inc. The name of the Company was changed to Ficaar, Inc. in December of 2007 and to HFactor, Inc. on September 2, 2021.
The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.
On May 28, 2021, David Cicalese (“Cicalese”), an officer and Board member of Ficaar entered into an agreement with Gail Levy whereby Cicalese agreed to sell 29,900,000 shares, representing a majority interest in Ficaar, to Levy. Acting as the majority shareholder of the Company, Levy then caused Ficaar to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") between the Company, FCAA Merger Sub I, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Ficaar, and HyEdge, Inc. ("Target" or "HyEdge"), a Delaware corporation, wherein Merger Sub and Target would merge, with Target surviving the transaction as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ficaar (the "Merger"). The Merger Agreement was executed on August 6, 2021 and the Merger closed on August 9, 2021. The Merger effected a change in control and was accounted for as a "reverse acquisition" whereby Target is the accounting acquiror for financial statement purposes. Accordingly, for all periods subsequent to the Closing Date, the financial statements of the Company reflect the historical financial statements of HyEdge and any operations of the Company subsequent to the Merger.
Plan of Operations
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
HFactor water was created by Gail Levy, HyEdge's founder and CEO. Gail is a successful serial entrepreneur who was looking for a new product that could alleviate the toxic side effects of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs that had riddled a dear friend. As she researched the properties of hydrogen water, she became more and more enthralled by its potential. Ms. Levy felt she could honor her friend by making hydrogen water immaculate, effective, and accessible to everyone. Enlivened by this mission, she collected a team of experts to help her engineer a natural process to combine hydrogen with water with zero impurities and optimal impact. In 2017, she launched her flagship product through retail and ecommerce channels. HFactor was developed and is manufactured by a team of experts in the U.S. and utilizes a patented chemical-free and magnesium-free process to infuse free hydrogen into its water. Its award winning, environmentally friendly ergonomic pouch keeps the hydrogen potent and pure and makes it extremely portable.
HFactor's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits appeal to a wide population across every age group, positioning HFactor to capture significant share in an expanding market. The global market for bottled water is projected to reach $215B by 2025. HFactor has demonstrated significant market traction, with $2.87M sales in 2020, 30M+ followers across Social Media channels.
The quality of our product is achieved through a proprietary manufacturing process. A reverse osmosis filtering system and patent-protected infusion process ensures efficacy, purity, and taste. The efficacy of hydrogen water is backed by over 1,000 published peer reviewed studies demonstrating that hydrogen positively impacts fitness, health, lifestyle, recovery, and wellness.
Our sales strategy involves a diversified, multi-channel approach. Our products are currently on shelves in approximately 5,000+ retail stores across 20 chains in addition to our growing ecommerce presence. Our company prides itself on having a low carbon footprint, primarily due to our eco-conscious packaging and free mail-in recycling program through our partnership with Teracycle.
Our mission statement is to build a brand and corporate culture that, at its essence, exhibits strength in oneself and in one's community. We promote a foundation of "doing well by doing good". This foundation enables HFactor to produce and distribute the highest quality "better for you" consumer products that are conscious to the community, mind, body, and the environment
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2021 to Year Ended December 30, 2020
Results of Operations
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $751,773 as compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted from the merger of HyEdge.
Gross profits for the year ended December 30, 2021 were $331,573 as compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total operating expenses were $1,119,228 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $16,562 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 6,6587% increase was primarily attributable to the additional operating expenses resulting from the merger of HyEdge, specifically $654,847 in sales and marketing expenses and $225,148 in payroll and compensation.
Other income (expense) was $(805,038) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(8,686) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $796,352 increase was primarily $619,399 in amortization of debt discount and derivative expenses associated with embedded liabilities in convertible debt, $124,406 in change in fair market value of derivatives and $94,390 increase in interest expenses associated with borrowings.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported a net loss of $1,592,693 as compared to a net loss of $25,248 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $1,567,445 increase in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 mainly arose from the additional net loss resulting from the merger of HyEdge.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $250,854 in cash to fund its operations. The Company reported working capital deficit of $4,855,836 at December 31, 2021 as compared to a working capital deficit of $66,694 at December 31, 2020, representing an increase in working capital deficit by $4,789,142.
The Company does not believe its current cash balance will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its planned operating activities for the next twelve months. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail some of its planned activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
As the Company continues to incur losses, achieving profitability is dependent on achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company's cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional capital. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public equity offering and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners of from other sources. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Any equity financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders.
Operating Activities:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flow used by operating activities was $(826,956) compared to -$0- for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decreases in cash flow used for operating activities for both periods were primarily due to increases in operating expenditures.
Investing and Financing Activities:
Net cash flows provided by (used) in investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $226,190 in net repayments from borrowings, offset with $650,000 from sales of common stock shares and $654,000 in proceeds from borrowings compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resource Measures:
The Company’s primary source of liquidity has been from convertible loans and third party and related party loans.
Going Concern
The Company has experienced a net loss and had an accumulated deficit of $4,598,617 as of December 21, 2021. The success of our business plan during the next 12 months and beyond will be contingent upon generating sufficient revenue to cover our costs of operations and/or upon obtaining additional financing.
Transaction with Related Parties:
None
