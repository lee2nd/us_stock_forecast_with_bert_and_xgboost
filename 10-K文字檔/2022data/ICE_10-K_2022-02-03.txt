ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2020 compared to 2019 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 4, 2021.
Overview
We are a provider of market infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. We report our results in three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.
•In our Exchanges segment, we operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities.
•In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions.
•In our Mortgage Technology segment, we provide an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market.
Recent Developments
Bakkt Transaction
On October 15, 2021, Bakkt Holdings, LLC, or Bakkt, completed its merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital, or VPC. Bakkt is an integrated platform that enables customers and consumers to transact in digital assets.
The business combination between Bakkt and VIH resulted in enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $479 million of cash on the combined company’s balance sheet, reflecting a contribution of up to $123 million of cash held in VIH’s trust account, and a $325 million concurrent private investment in public equity, or PIPE, of Class A common stock of the combined company and $31 million of cash held in Bakkt accounts. The PIPE was priced at $10.00 per share and included a $47 million commitment from us. The newly combined company has been renamed Bakkt Holdings, Inc. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.
As part of the transaction, Bakkt’s existing equity holders and management rolled 100% of their equity into the combined company, and are subject to a six-month lockup period. Certain shareholders of VIH exercised their redemption rights, and at closing, Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, owned approximately 81% of the combined company, VIH’s public shareholders owned approximately 5%, VPC owned 2%, and PIPE investors (a group that also includes us) owned approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company.
Following completion of the business combination, we initially held a 68% economic interest and a minority voting interest in the combined company. Prior to the closing, Bakkt revenues and operating expenses were reported within our consolidated revenues and operating expenses. Following the closing, as a consequence of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated Bakkt and treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements. We recorded a gain on the transaction of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, which is included in other non-operating income within our consolidated income statement. For the three
months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded estimated equity losses of ($92 million) related to our investment in Bakkt.
COVID-19
Since March 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth.
From an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and many of our employees are continuing to work remotely. We believe that our global office closures and phased re-opening measures were and continue to be in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. We continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.
Global health concerns relating to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services.
The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 over the long term and against new and emerging variants thereof, and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. We continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by U.S. and other governmental authorities. In light of the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.
Consolidated Financial Highlights
The following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
*Percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders are presented net of taxes. These adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.1 billion in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenues includes $44 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020.
•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $834 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues includes $7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.
•Operating expenses increased $694 million in 2021 from 2020. The increase in operating expenses includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020.
•Operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.
•Other income (expense), net, in 2021 primarily includes our gain on the Bakkt transaction of $1.4 billion, our gain on the sale of our Coinbase Global, Inc., or Coinbase, investment of $1.2 billion, equity earnings in OCC of $51 million, estimated equity losses in our investment in Bakkt during the post-merger period of $92 million, dividend income from Euroclear plc, or Euroclear, of $60 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our Euroclear investment of $34 million and interest expense of $423 million.
•Other income (expense), net, in 2020 primarily includes interest expense of $357 million, equity earnings in OCC of $71 million, an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our Euroclear investment of $35 million, and gain on the sale of our BIDS Trading, LP, or BIDS, investment of $20 million.
•The effective tax rate in 2021 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts resulting from the U.K. tax law changes as well as the Bakkt transaction. In June 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023.
•The effective tax rate in 2020 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2019.
Business Environment and Market Trends
Our business environment has been characterized by:
•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;
•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;
•commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;
•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;
•evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;
•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;
•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;
•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;
•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;
•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and
•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.
Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will
have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 49% in 2021. These recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.
Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:
•increasing global regulatory demands;
•greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;
•greater emphasis on risk management;
•market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;
•the move to passive investing and indexation;
•ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;
•increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets;
•the development of new data products;
•the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;
•new entrants; and
•increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.
We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.
Segment Results
Our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:
•Our Exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and NYSE businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our NYSE listings business. Trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, OTC and other;
•Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, trade execution and clearing within our ICE Bonds and CDS businesses, consolidated feeds and our ICE Global Network businesses; and
•Our Mortgage Technology segment includes origination technology, closing solutions, data and analytics and other mortgage technology businesses.
While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, origination technology revenues include those related to our ICE Mortgage Technology network (previously reported in closing solutions revenues) and closing solutions revenues now include registration revenues related to MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., or MERS, (previously reported in other revenues). We believe these changes more accurately reflect how we operate the business. Prior-year periods have been adjusted to reflect these changes.
For details on trends in recent prior-year periods, refer to our 2020 and 2019 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.
Exchanges Segment
The following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):
(1) The adjusted figures in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
*Percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
(1)Transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business.
Exchanges Revenues
Our Exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and NYSE exchanges, related data and connectivity services, and our listings business. Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
In 2021 and 2020, 17% and 14%, respectively, of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $30 million in 2021 from 2020.
Our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $1.0 billion and $962 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in rebates is primarily due to the launch of new products, including ICE Murban crude oil futures and the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA.
•Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume increased 1% and revenues increased 10% in 2021 from 2020.
-Total oil volume increased 3% in 2021 from 2020 driven by price volatility related to oil supply and demand dynamics and macroeconomic uncertainty in late 2021.
-Our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2021 from 2020 as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility related to COVID-19, partially offset by 2021 continued growth in our TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes driven by the globalization of gas, coupled with heightened price volatility in 2021 related to natural gas supply and demand dynamics in the U.K. and Europe.
-Our environmentals and other futures and options volume increased 18% to record levels in 2021 from 2020 due to an increase in the price of carbon and continued demand for market-based mechanisms to price climate risk and help enable greenhouse gas reduction goals.
•Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 10% and revenues decreased 7% in 2021 from 2020. The overall decrease in agricultural volumes was due to 2020 benefiting from elevated volatility related to COVID-19 and a sharp decline in oil prices, partially offset by elevated volatility in late 2021 as a result of weather-related supply and demand dynamics impacting our Coffee and Cotton markets as well as geopolitical events impacting our Cocoa markets.
-Sugar futures and options volumes decreased 21% in 2021 from 2020.
-Other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes were flat in 2021 as compared to 2020.
•Financial Futures and Options: Total volume increased 2% and revenues increased 10% in our financial futures and options markets in 2021 from 2020.
-Interest rate futures and options volume and revenue increased 6% and 23% in 2021 from 2020, respectively, driven by interest rate volatility from increased speculation of central bank activity due to post-pandemic global economic re-opening and inflation concerns. Interest rate futures and options revenues were $237 million and $193 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
-Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI®, FTSE® and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, decreased 12% and revenue decreased 4% in 2021 from 2020. Other financial futures and options volume decreased as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by the emergence of COVID-19. Other financial futures and options revenues were $157 million and $164 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume decreased 6% in 2021 from 2020 as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by the emergence of COVID-19. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $246 million and $276 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity options volume increased 40% in 2021 from 2020 driven by increased participation and higher market share. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $109 million and $101 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other revenues increased 10% in 2021 from 2020. Following the October 2021 Bakkt transaction, Bakkt revenues are no longer included within our OTC and other revenues.
•Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 6% in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers and increased purchases by existing customers.
•Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues increased 7% in 2021 from 2020, driven by equity capital markets activity, including an increase in demand for special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, listings.
Listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges- original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
In a record year for new issuance, NYSE raised $221 billion in IPOs and follow-on offerings from over 594 transactions, an increase of 20% from $185 billion raised in 2020.
Selected Operating Data
The following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts):
Volume and Rate per Contract
Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” - in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. The following charts and table present our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages):
The following charts and tables present selected cash and equity options trading data. All trading volume below is presented as average net daily trading volume, or ADV, and is single counted:
Handled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.
Transaction-Based Expenses
Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of
payment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $248 million and $622 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in Section 31 fees was primarily related to a decline in rates, which were revised in February of both years. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $57 million as of December 31, 2021.
We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin

Fixed Income and Data Services Segment
The following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our Fixed Income and Data Services segment (dollars in millions):
(1) The adjusted figures in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment represents fixed income and credit trading and clearing as well as subscription-based, or recurring, revenues related to our fixed income data and analytics offerings as well as other multi-asset class data and network services.
In both 2021 and 2020, 14% of our Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2021, our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues were higher by $14 million in 2021 than in 2020.
Fixed Income and Data Services Revenues
Our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues increased 4% in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to growth in our fixed income data and analytics products and our other data and network services.
•Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our fixed income execution revenues decreased 25% in 2021 from 2020. The decrease in revenue was due to 2020 benefiting from price volatility related to COVID-19, as well as decreased retail activity, particularly in municipal and corporate bonds, as a result of low interest rates.
•CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues decreased 8% in 2021 from 2020. The notional value of CDS cleared was $17.0 trillion and $17.9 trillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Elevated volatility in 2020 related to COVID-19 benefited 2020 revenues, with volatility and cleared volumes generally returning to more normal levels late in 2021.
•Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 6% in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenue was due to strength in our index business and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, and increased purchases by existing customers.
•Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 8% in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled with strength in our consolidated feeds and desktop revenues.
Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well as Other Data and Network Services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.
As of December 31, 2021, ASV was $1.646 billion, which increased 4.9% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2020. ASV represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.

*Percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful due to the acquisition of Ellie Mae in September 2020.
Mortgage Technology Revenues
Our mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive, end-to-end U.S. residential mortgage platform. Our mortgage technology business enables greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating U.S. residential mortgage loans. Mortgage technology revenues increased $812 million or 137% in 2021 from 2020. Revenues from Ellie Mae following our September 2020 acquisition were $351 million in 2020.
•Origination technology: Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or Success-Based Pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription.
In addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE Mortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based.
•Closing solutions: Our closing solutions uniquely connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the traditionally manual and paper-based closing and recording process. Our closing solutions also include revenues from the MERS database, a leading system for recording and tracking changes in mortgage servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate. Closing solutions revenues increased in 2021 from 2020 as a result of an increase in residential home sales, market share gains and increased demand and adoption of digital solutions. Revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based.
•Data and Analytics: Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology’s Automation, Intelligence, Quality, or AIQ, offering, which applies machine learning and artificial intelligence, or AI, to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. AIQ revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of nearly half the U.S. residential mortgage market. We also provide a Data as a Service, or DaaS, offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.
•Other: Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products. Other revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature.

Consolidated Operating Expenses
The following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):
*Percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses, including data acquisition costs, licensing and other fee-related arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.
We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.
In 2021 and 2020, 10% and 11%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $22 million higher in 2021 than in 2020. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information.
Compensation and Benefits Expenses
Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).
Employee headcount decreased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt, which was partially offset by increased hiring in 2021. Ellie Mae compensation and benefits expense was $174 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to our September 2020 acquisition. Bakkt compensation and benefits expense was $16 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to increases in employee headcount prior to deconsolidating Bakkt. In addition, compensation and benefits expense increased $67 million in 2021 from 2020 due to merit pay increases, above target performance-based compensation and higher employee insurance costs than in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. The stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards.
Professional Services Expenses
Professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business.
Professional services expenses increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to an increase of $26 million from Ellie Mae which was partially offset by lower legal expenses for 2021.
Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs
In 2021, we incurred $59 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to the deconsolidation of Bakkt, which included $31 million non-cash compensation related to a market condition event triggered on the Bakkt equity incentive awards in connection with the merger of Bakkt and VIH. Additionally, we incurred $39 million in integration costs related to Ellie Mae.
We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.
Technology and Communication Expenses
Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.
Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
Technology and communications expenses increased by $117 million in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of Ellie Mae expenses, which were $87 million higher in 2021 than in 2020. In addition, technology and communications expenses increased by $24 million in 2021 from 2020 due to increased license fees and data acquisition costs.
Rent and Occupancy Expenses
Rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in the U.S., U.K., and India, with smaller offices located throughout the world.
Rent and occupancy expenses includes the expenses of Ellie Mae, which increased $6 million in 2021 from 2020. These expenses were partially offset by a reduction in other occupancy expenses in 2021 and the early termination of our NYSE Chicago office lease in 2020. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of $13 million of Ellie Mae expenses and $12 million of Bakkt expenses related to the launch of Bakkt's digital wallet, Bakkt App. In addition, marketing expenses increased $19 million in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to a higher number of NYSE initial public offerings, or IPOs, which were partially offset by a charitable contribution in support of COVID-19 relief efforts of $10 million and an $8 million regulatory settlement accrual in 2020.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of
businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.
We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $622 million and $388 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of Ellie Mae intangible assets of $246 million.
We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $387 million and $363 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the depreciation of Ellie Mae fixed assets of $31 million, partially offset by a software impairment charge of $11 million in 2020 related to a portion of customized software developed at Bakkt that was no longer useful.
Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)
Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):
Interest Income
Interest income decreased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to a decrease in short-term interest rates on various investments.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in May 2020 to refinance existing debt, the issuance of senior notes in August 2020 related to the Ellie Mae acquisition, and $4 million in accelerated unamortized costs related to the early redemption in September 2021 of the floating rate notes due June 2023, partially offset by a $14 million extinguishment payment we incurred related to the June 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of December 1, 2020, or the December 2020 Senior Notes, and $5 million pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for Ellie Mae acquisition. See “- Debt” below.
Other income (expense), net
During 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH, which resulted in an initial 68% economic interest, and we recorded a gain of $1.4 billion as other income upon our deconsolidation of Bakkt. Following the merger, we show our economic interest share of estimated Bakkt profits/(losses) as equity earnings, which are also included in other income (expense), net. We recorded other expense of ($92 million) related to our Bakkt investment for the post-merger period during 2021.
During 2021, Coinbase completed an IPO and we sold our investment in Coinbase for $1.2 billion, and recorded a gain of $1.2 billion as other income.
During 2021, we recorded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim from a prior acquisition as other income. In addition, we accrued approximately $16 million related to a legal settlement. In 2020, we recorded an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million as other income.
We own a 40% interest in the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, which we treat as an equity method investment. OCC is regulated by the SEC and the CFTC. We recognized $51 million and $71 million of equity earnings as our share of OCC's estimated profits during 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in other income. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on our OCC investment.
In connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $60 million in 2021 and $19 million in 2019, included in other income. As a result of a 2020 European regulation limiting dividend payments, we did not receive a Euroclear dividend in 2020, but we received two dividend payments during 2021. In addition, in both September 2021 and in November 2020 we became aware of observable price changes in orderly transactions of similar Euroclear investments by third parties. The transactions resulted in fair value adjustments of our Euroclear investment, and we recorded gains of $34 million and $35 million in other income in 2021 and 2020, respectively, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange.
We historically held a 9% ownership interest in BIDS, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS Alternative Trading System. In December 2020, we sold our investment in BIDS to Cboe and recorded a gain on the sale of $20 million, included in other income.
We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.
