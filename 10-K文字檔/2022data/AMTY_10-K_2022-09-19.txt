Overview
Amerityre engages in the research and development, manufacturing, and sale of solid polyurethane foam tires. We have developed unique polyurethane formulations that allow us to make products with superior performance characteristics, compared to conventional rubber tires, in the areas of abrasion resistance, energy efficiency and load-bearing capabilities. Our manufacturing processes are more energy efficient than the traditional rubber tire manufacturing processes, in part because our polyurethane compounds do not require the multiple processing steps, extreme heat, and high pressure necessary to cure rubber. We believe tires produced with our proprietary polyurethane formulations last longer, are less susceptible to failure and are friendlier to the environment when compared to competitor offerings.
We focus our business on applications and markets where our advantages in product technology, tire performance, and customer service give us an opportunity to obtain premium pricing. Our product development and marketing efforts are focused on building customer relationships and expanding sales with original equipment manufacturers and tire distributors. Our competitive advantage is creating unique product solutions for customers who have challenging tire performance requirements that cannot be met by competitor offerings.
Closed cell Polyurethane Foam Tires - The sale of polyurethane foam tires to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers represents the majority of our sales revenue. We produce a broad range of tire sizes for the light duty tire market, including bicycle tires, hand truck tires, mobility tires, and lawn/garden tires.
Despite the ongoing negative effects of COVID-19, supply chain bottlenecks, and severe inflation on the overall US economy, we experienced higher than expected record demand for our polyurethane foam tires in the recent quarter. Sales for the fiscal fourth quarter 2022 were 40.8% higher than the sales level in fiscal fourth quarter 2021. We continue to see strong sales demand, as we engage new customers and expand our customer base.
Our industrial tire product line, which includes our golf car tires, our 480 x 12 tires, and our 570 x 12 tires, continues to see strong growth. We expect these tires to continue to grow in popularity as more people discover these tires for industrial applications. In fiscal year 2022 we sold a record number of golf cart tire assemblies (18 x 8.50 tire assemblies).
Polyurethane Elastomer Tires - Our elastomer formulations are used to manufacture tires requiring higher levels of abrasion resistance and greater load bearing capability. Forklift tires constitute a large part of this market, with other industrial and agricultural applications representing other opportunities. Overall sales volumes of our forklift tires remain small, less than 0.1% of our total sales revenue. Price sensitive consumers continue to favor imported solid rubber press-on forklift tires rather than our products. We have not devoted significant resources towards promoting this product line. We have been working with OEMs to utilize our elastomer formulations for large industrial equipment tires and agricultural applications.
Light Density Elastomer Tires - The Company continues to see great interest in its light-density elastomer formulation for use in tire applications where customers need higher abrasion resistance and load bearing capability. Our Elastothane® 500 formulation provides better abrasion resistance and overall performance in these areas compared to our closed cell foam formulation. Lawn and garden tire applications continue to drive increased sales of this formulation. We expect Agricultural tires sales to increase in the coming quarters as farm income benefits from higher crop prices and farmers have more disposable income. We continue to approach OEMs and large distributors about promoting and utilizing our tires for certain agricultural applications, but to date we have not been able to secure a partnership that brings us significant business. and several are evaluating sample tires.
We believe investment in new and improved products is vital to the continued growth and success of our overall business, and we will selectively invest in promising opportunities that can be supported within our current financial model. We have several product evaluation programs ongoing which have the potential to develop into significant future business. We expect our current R&D investments to continue to prove to be a prudent investment of our capital resources.
A major component of the strategic operating plan we discussed during our annual meeting in December 2021 was the desire to increase our product distribution through partnerships with large OEMs and distributors. We continue to pursue discussions with various entities to establish these relationships, but unfortunately we have not been successful in completing an arrangement. However, we maintain that an agreement with a partner that can provide an established distribution network and/or financial resources is important to enable Amerityre to quickly scale its product portfolio in key market segments.
As described above, our product line covers diverse market segments which are unrelated in terms of customer base, product distribution, market demands and competition. Our sales team is comprised of independent manufacturer representatives with inside sales support. The Company’s continued emphasis on proper product pricing continues to drive more profitable sales. Our website educates the marketplace about our products as well as offers a growing outlet for online sales.
Factors Affecting Results of Operations
Our operating expenses consisted primarily of the following:
•
Cost of sales, which consists primarily of raw materials, components and production costs of our products, including applied labor costs and benefits expenses, maintenance, facilities and other operating costs associated with the production of our products;
•
Selling, general and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and related benefits paid to our employees and related selling and administrative costs including professional fees;
•
Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of direct labor conducting research and development, equipment and materials used in new product development and product improvement using our technologies;
•
Consulting expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid to third parties for outside services;
•
Depreciation and amortization expenses which result from the depreciation of our property and equipment, including amortization of our intangible assets; and
•
Stock based compensation expense related to stock and stock option awards issued to directors, employees and consultants for services performed for the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation, deferred compensation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
At present we do not have any critical accounting policies that require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that may be uncertain.
Results of Operations
Our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality and potential variability of our sales and cash flows. These key performance indicators include:
•
Revenues, net of returns and trade discounts, which consists of product sales and services and is an indicator of our overall business growth and the success of our sales and marketing efforts;
•
Gross profit, which is an indicator of both competitive pricing pressures and the cost of goods sold of our products and the mix of product and license fees, if any;
•
Growth in our customer base, both in new customer accounts and sales of new products to existing customers, which is an indicator of the success of our sales efforts; and
•
Distribution of sales across our products offered.
The following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below.
(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense of $116,123 and $88,806 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
Year Ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2021
Net revenues. Net revenues of $6,495,530 for the year ended June 30, 2022, represents an increase of $1,632,118 or 33.6%, over net revenues of 4,863,412 during the year ended June 30, 2021. These represent record revenue results for Amerityre. The results were primarily driven by increased demand for polyurethane foam tires from current customers We expect sales for the upcoming fiscal year to be level with fiscal year 2022 results, as the negative effects of an expected slowing US economy are offset by sales to new customer accounts.
Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022, was $4,740,931 or 73.0% of revenues compared to $3,579,227 or 73.6% of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021. We experienced higher raw material costs, particularly chemical feedstocks, during the recent quarter which pressured gross profit margins. We were successful at maintaining margins through the price increases we implemented during the year. We expect raw material prices to stabilize in fiscal year 2023, as US government monetary policy slows the economy and demand slows to a point where available supply and demand equalize, we will continue to monitor our product pricing to determine if any adjustments are required due to operating cost changes. We recognize that continuing increases in raw material costs may result in reduced product sales if we are forced to turn away sales because we cannot sell product at a price that is profitable.
Gross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2022, of $1,754,599 represents a 36.7% increase over gross profit of $1,284,185 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The fiscal year 2022 gross profit reflects a 27.0% gross margin for product sales compared to a gross margin on product sales of 26.4% for fiscal year 2021. The level gross margin figures year over year indicates that our product pricing strategy was successful in covering the cost increases in raw materials and other operating costs.
Research and Development expenses. Research and development expense of $101,817 for the year ended June 30, 2022, which is basically the same expense of $102,265 for the year ended June 30, 2021. Expenditure on research and development continues to be focused on addressing company needs on new formulations and new product development. All research and development activities continue to be financed from our internally generated cash flow.
Sales and Marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expense of $281,440 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, represents a 24.9% increase over expenses of $224,686 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The difference between periods relates to higher sales commission expense due to higher overall sales
General and Administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses of $963,890 for the year ended June 30, 2022, represents a 11.8% increase over the same expense of $860,693 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was caused by higher executive compensation, higher merchant processing fees by customers paying with a credit card, offset by lower legal fees and warranty expense. We continue to pursue more efficient ways to conduct our business activities.
Other Income (Expense). Other income was $24,435 for the year ended June 30, 2022, which is lower than the figure from fiscal year 2021. Other income of $161,795 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, includes forgiveness of our loan from the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program plus various small grants available from Federal and State agencies during the fiscal year, offset by loss on the full impairment of equipment available for sale.
Net Income. The net income for the year ended June 30, 2022, of $431,887 represents a 67.2% increase from the $258,336 net income for the year ended June 30, 2021. Removing the one-time, positive effect of the $149,500 PPP loan forgiveness, the net income increase year over year was 296.8%. The fiscal year net income of $431,887 represents a record annual profit for Amerityre.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, and 20201.
The Company has evaluated its current cash position relative to its cash requirements in the future and has determined its cash levels are sufficient to cover its cash needs. The Company enjoys a strong level of cash on hand as well as an unused credit line facility. These cash resources have been critical during the past year as working capital needs have increased due to the extended time required to receive imported materials (which are paid for when they are ready to ship from the manufacturer, not after they are received for use by the Company) as well as Management’s decision to increase chemical stock levels when extra material became available for purchase. The Company is also planning to upgrade production equipment during fiscal year 2023, and we are completing an analysis to determine if debt financing is required to complete the project.
The major driver in our cash provided by operating activities was the collection of accounts receivable offset by increased costs (and therefore value) of inventory on the balance sheet.
Our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash on hand and payments received from our customers. In February 2020, the Company secured a $50,000 line of credit with a local community bank. The Company drew down from this line of credit for the first time in February 2022 due to a late customer payment. The amount borrowed was paid back in full in March 2022. As of March 31, 2022, the Company also negotiated to increase the line from $50,000 to $100,000 and reduce the variable interest rate from 5.75% to 4.50%.
Historically, the current management team has been reluctant to pursue financing at terms that subject the Company to the high costs of debt or raise money through the sale of equity at prices we believe do not reflect the true value of the Company.
Cash Position, Outstanding Indebtedness and Future Capital Requirements
On September 14, 2022, our total cash balance was $1,099,392, none of which is restricted; accounts receivables were $408,463; and inventory, net of reserves for slow moving or obsolete inventory, and other current assets was $1,021,508. Our total indebtedness, specifically which management reviews for cash management, was $1,022,792 and includes $696,829 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $2,000 in current portion of long-term debt, $60,713 in long-term debt and $263,250 in total operating lease liability.
We continue to take actions to improve our liquidity and access to capital resources. Management believes that an equity financing in the current market environment at the current share price would be too dilutive and not in the best interests of our shareholders. In the past year we have successfully increased the limit on our existing bank line of credit. We have utilized this line of credit as short-term access to capital which has allowed us to make strategic purchases of raw materials.
In assessing our liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditure commitments, cash requirements and other obligations. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022, we have analyzed our cash needs for the next twelve months. We believe that our available cash, accounts receivables, and existing bank credit lines are sufficient to meet our current minimum working capital, capital expenditure and other cash requirements for this period. Although we have seen a significant increase in business activity in recent quarters, there can be no assurance that a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus will not cause another significant decrease in demand from our customers. The emergence of new and transmittable variants of COVID-19 may result in possible resurgence of the virus and new restrictions in certain geographies and among certain businesses. The long-term financial impact on our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As a result, the effects of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods. Refer to “Item 1A - Risk Factors” for a description of the material risks that the Company currently faces in connection with COVID-19. If there is a new shutdown of the economy, reduction in demand for our products or other adverse effect on our business, we may lack sufficient working capital to meet our needs for the next 12 months.
The Company has, on occasion, instituted initiatives to incentivize sales of slower-moving inventory through promotional pricing. These programs will continue to be selectively utilized in the upcoming quarters to monetize inventory, promote individual product lines, and improve our cash flow.
As of September 14, 2022, the Company has approximately 13,527,000 shares authorized and available for issuance. Although we are reluctant to raise money through stock sales at what we believe are dilutive share prices, these authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of our common stock can be utilized, if necessary, to raise new funds.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
