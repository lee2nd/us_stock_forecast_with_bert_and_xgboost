General Trends and Outlook
We anticipate our business will continue to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, and the U.S. economy began to experience pronounced effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus and its variant strains ("COVID-19") has disrupted the U.S. economy since the first quarter of 2020 and immediately resulted in a decline in demand for our products. We began to see improvement in demand for our natural gas and NGL products and services beginning late in the second half of 2020, which continued through 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain due to numerous factors outside of the Company's control, including but not limited to the severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak, new variants, the effectiveness of public safety measures, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines, and supply chain pressures. Management continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the degree to which these factors will impact our business and our results of operations in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and the related financial impact of any such disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
We have taken measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic in order to maintain essential business functions at our plants and critical infrastructure with minimal disruptions. Our current continuity plan specifically addresses technology, communications, and remote operations. We continue to prioritize safe and reliable operations and have not experienced a disruption to operations or incurred significant additional costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our business is impacted by commodity prices and volumes. We mitigate a significant portion of commodity price risk on an overall Partnership basis through our fee-based assets and by executing on our hedging program. Various factors impact both commodity prices and volumes, and as indicated in
