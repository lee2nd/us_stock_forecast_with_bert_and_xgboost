ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are engaged in the development, marketing, manufacturing, acquisition, operation and sale of a broad spectrum of nutritional and related products with an emphasis on health and wellness. Structured as a global holding company, we are executing a buy-and-build strategy with serial accretive acquisitions creating a vertically integrated company with an objective of aggregating companies generating a minimum of $300 million in revenues within the next thirty-six months. To drive growth and earnings, we are developing proprietary products as well as acquiring other profitable companies, encompassing brands, manufacturing and distribution channels.
On March 8, 2018, we acquired 51% of BSNM and on October 9, 2019, we acquired the remaining 49%. BSNM is a nutraceutical contract manufacturer. It specializes in a wide variety of products, from the private labeling of vitamins, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, sport nutrition and broad-spectrum nutritional supplements, and sells them throughout the United States and around the world, including South America, Central America and Europe.
On July 1, 2021, we acquired DSO. DSO manufactures, sells and owns the Smart for Life brand of natural health and wellness meal replacement products. The brand includes proprietary hunger suppressing functional foods that are designed to work with the body’s natural ability to lose weight. It also develops premium supplements and commodities that will promote optimal health and wellness. DSO has over 15 years of experience providing high-quality products to premium retail locations and companies. Its branded vitamins and supplements are also being sold through Amazon, and this sales channel is becoming a major contributor to the growth of the brand online.
On November 8, 2021, we acquired Nexus. Nexus operates a cost per action/cost per acquisition network. This network consists of hundreds of digital marketers who stand ready to market products introduced to the Nexus network. The cost per action/cost per acquisition model is where digital marketers are paid for an action (e.g., a product sale or lead generation) that is taken as a direct result of their marketing efforts. Through the digital marketer’s method of marketing, the digital marketer sends traffic to one of the product vendor’s offers listed on the network.
On December 6, 2021, we acquired GSP. GSP is a sports nutrition company. It offers nutritional supplements for athletes and active lifestyle consumers through a variety of wellness solutions and delivery methods, including powders, tablets and soft gels that are formulated to support energy and performance; nutrition and wellness; and focus and clarity. GSP’s initial line of nutritional products are marketed under the Sports Illustrated Nutrition brand. The product line currently consists of whey protein isolate powder, tablet supplements for joint health, nitric oxide, post workout blends, Omega-3 supplements, and pre-workout supplements, among others.
Recent Developments
Initial Public Offering
On February 16, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc., as representative of the several underwriters named on Schedule I thereto, relating to our initial public offering of units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, a series A warrant to purchase one share of common stock and a series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, we agreed to sell 1,440,000 units to the underwriters, at a purchase price per unit of $9.10 (the offering price to the public of $10.00 per unit minus the underwriters’ discount), and also agreed to grant to the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 216,000 additional shares of common stock, up to 216,000 additional series A warrants, and/or up to 216,000 additional series B warrants, in any combination thereof, at a purchase price to the public of $9.98 per share and $0.01 per warrant, less underwriting discounts and commissions, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
On February 18, 2022, the closing of our initial public offering was completed. At the closing, the underwriters partially exercised the option and purchased 206,390 series A warrants and 206,390 series B warrants. Therefore, we sold 1,440,000 shares of common stock, 1,646,390 series A warrants and 1,646,390 series B warrants for total gross proceeds of $14,404,128. After deducting the underwriting commission and expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $12,763,000. We used to the proceeds of the offering to pay off certain debt as described in “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and plan to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
The terms of the warrants included within the units are set forth in a warrant agent agreement, dated February 16, 2022, between our company and VStock Transfer, LLC, our transfer agent. The warrants are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance. The series A warrants have an exercise price of $7.00 per share and the series B warrants have an exercise price of $10.00 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments in certain circumstances, including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend on or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation, and may also be exercised on a cashless basis if at any time during the term of the warrants, the issuance of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not covered by an effective registration statement. Additionally, holders of series B warrants may exercise such warrants on a “cashless” basis upon the earlier of (i) 10 trading days from the issuance date of such warrant or (ii) the time when $10.0 million of volume is traded in our common stock, if the volume weighted average price of our common stock on any trading day on or after the date of issuance fails to exceed the exercise price of the series B warrant. In the event of a cashless exercise of the series B warrants as described in the preceding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable in such cashless exercise shall equal the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon exercise of the series B warrant in accordance with its terms if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise and (y) 1.00. The warrants also contain an exercise limitation, pursuant to which a holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of the warrant if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, which such percentage may be increased or decreased to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon 61 days’ notice to us.
As of March 30, 2022, 1,437,730 of the series B warrants have been exercised on a cashless basis and we issued 1,437,730 shares of common stock upon such exercise.
Private Placement of Notes and Warrants
In January 2022, we entered into note and warrant purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we sold to such investors (i) original issue discount secured subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $529,411 and (ii) warrants for the purchase of 90,000 shares of common stock (equal to the investors’ investment amount divided by $5.00, the effective initial public offering price), for total gross proceeds of $450,000. These notes have an original issue discount of 15% and additionally bore interest at 15% per annum and were due upon completion of our initial public offering. These notes were repaid in full upon closing of our initial public offering.
These warrants are excisable at any time during the three (3) year period commencing on August 18, 2022 (the sixth (6th) month anniversary of the closing of the initial public offering) at an exercise price of $6.25 (125% of the effective initial public offering price), subject to standard adjustments for stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations and similar transactions, and may be exercised on a cashless basis if the market value of our common stock is greater than such exercise price.
Repayment of Debt
Between February and March 2022, we repaid loans with various individuals equal to $4,530,912.
Conversion of Debt
Upon closing of our initial public offering on February 18, 2022, the 5% secured subordinated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1,900,000 issued to Justin Francisco and Steven Rubert in connection with the acquisition of Nexus was automatically converted into 386,460 shares of common stock. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
Upon closing of our initial public offering on February 18, 2022, the 6% secured subordinated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $3,000,000 issued to Sasson E. Moulavi in connection with the acquisition of DSO was automatically converted into 623,200 shares of common stock. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
Upon closing of our initial public offering on February 18, 2022, the convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 issued to East West Capital LLC was automatically converted into 229,834 shares of common stock. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
Issuances of Common Stock
Upon closing of our initial public offering on February 18, 2022, we issued an additional 57,223 shares of common stock to the stockholders of GSP in accordance with the terms of the contribution and exchange agreement described above.
Upon closing of our initial public offering on February 18, 2022, we issued an aggregate of 2,179,269 shares of common stock to various lenders pursuant to future equity agreements which required us to issue shares of common stock upon closing of the initial public offering.
On March 10, 2022, we granted restricted stock awards for an aggregate of 877,000 shares of common stock to certain directors, officers and consultants. A total of 677,000 of these shares vested in full on the date of grant. The remaining 200,000 shares, which were granted to independent directors, vest monthly over a one-year period. A total of 547,000 of these shares were granted under our 2020 Stock Incentive Plan described below. The remaining 330,000 were granted under our 2022 Equity Incentive Plan described below.
Conversion of Preferred Stock
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, 7,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock have been converted into common stock by the preferred stock stockholders. As a result, 1,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock remain outstanding.
Signing of Ceautamed Acquisition
On March 14, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Ceautamed Worldwide, LLC, or Ceautamed, RMB Industries, Inc., RTB Childrens Trust and D&D Hayes, LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Ceautamed, a vitamin and supplement company, for an aggregate purchase price of $9,750,000, consisting of (i) $4,875,000 in cash, (ii) convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,437,500 and (iii) non-convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,437,500, subject to certain adjustments described below.
The purchase price is based upon a six and one-half (6.5) times multiple of estimated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) for the calendar year 2021. We have engaged a firm to prepare a quality of earnings report on Ceautamed and its subsidiaries. The purchase price will be adjusted upwards or downwards upon delivery of such quality of earnings report based upon the difference between six and one-half (6.5) times the adjusted EBITDA as shown in the quality of earnings report and the purchase price. The adjusted purchase price will be allocated among the cash portion of the purchase price and the notes based on the percentage of the purchase price that each such component of consideration makes up as described above.
In addition, the cash portion of the purchase price will be (i) decreased by the amount of any outstanding indebtedness of Ceautamed for borrowed money existing as of the closing date and any unpaid transaction expenses, and (ii) increased by the amount of cash and cash equivalents of Ceautamed and its subsidiaries as of the closing date.
The purchase price is also subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment provision. Within ninety (90) days after the closing, we are required to deliver to the sellers an unaudited balance sheet of Ceautamed and its subsidiaries as of the closing date and our calculation of the closing working capital (as defined in the securities purchase agreement). If such closing working capital exceeds a minimum working capital equal to the average monthly working capital of Ceautamed for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, then we must promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) business days) pay to the sellers an amount that is equal to such excess. If such minimum working capital exceeds the closing working capital, then the sellers must promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) business days) pay us an amount that is equal to the deficiency. Such adjustments shall be paid as follows: (i) fifty percent (50%) shall be paid in cash, (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) shall be paid through an increase or reduction in the principal amount of the convertible promissory notes and (iii) twenty-five percent (25%) shall be paid through an increase or reduction in the principal amount of the non-convertible promissory notes.
The securities purchase agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a covenant that the sellers will not compete with the business of Ceautamed for a period of three (3) years following closing. The securities purchase agreement also contains mutual indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the securities purchase agreement. In the case of the indemnification provided by the sellers with respect to breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, the sellers will only become liable for indemnified losses if the amount exceeds $150,000, whereupon the sellers will be liable for all losses relating back to the first dollar, provided that the liability of the sellers for breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the purchase price and each seller’s aggregate liability for the breach of fundamental representations shall be limited to the purchase price.
The closing of the securities purchase agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of accounting and legal due diligence investigations; the receipt of all authorizations, consents and approvals of all governmental authorities and third parties; the release of any liens against any of the assets of Ceautamed; our obtaining the requisite acquisition financing; and delivery of all documents required for the transfer of the equity interests of Ceautamed to us.
Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. At this time, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty relating to the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it will impact our business, operations and financial results.
Most states and cities have at various times instituted quarantines, restrictions on travel, “stay at home” rules, social distancing measures and restrictions on the types of businesses that could continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it. Based on the nature of the business in our facilities in Doral and Riviera Beach, neither facility closed or operated at reduced capacity for our production and packaging operations. However, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we may be required to close or limit capacity in our facilities in response to guidance from applicable government and public health officials, which could adversely affect our operations and revenues.
In addition, we are dependent upon certain contract manufacturers and suppliers and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact certain of our manufacturers and suppliers. As a result, we have faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products and raw materials, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such raw materials, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.
The global deterioration in economic conditions, which may have an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending, could also impact our business and demand for our products. For instance, consumer spending may be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, including a rise in unemployment, and decreased consumer confidence resulting from the pandemic. Changing consumer behaviors as a result of the pandemic may also have a material impact on our revenue.
The spread of COVID-19 has also adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result, in a significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital in the future, which could negatively affect our liquidity.
If the COVID-19 pandemic does not continue to slow and the spread of COVID-19 is not contained, our business operations, including those of our contract manufacturers and suppliers, could be further delayed or interrupted. We expect that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions, which could require us to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. We may also experience limitations in employee resources. In addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees were suspected of having COVID-19, which could require quarantine of some or all such employees or closure of our facilities for disinfection. The duration of any business disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our ability to operate our business and result in additional costs.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this report, including the effectiveness of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19, and other new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and steps taken to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Nevertheless, the pandemic and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in the global supply chain and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also “Risk Factors” for more information.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:
● our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers;
● our ability to offer competitive product pricing;
● our ability to broaden product offerings;
● industry demand and competition; and
● market conditions and our market position.
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we will be permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:
● have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
● comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
● submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and
● disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, both in dollars and as a percentage of our revenues.
Revenues. Our nutraceutical business generates revenue from the sales of nutritional and related products. Our digital marketing business generates revenues when sales of listed products are sold by product vendors through our network as a result of the marketing efforts of digital marketers. Our total revenues were $9,022,593 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included $5,573,976 from DSO from the period from July 1, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, $692,022 from Nexus for the period from November 8, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021 and $82 from GSP for the period from December 6, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,959,595 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7,062,998, or 360.43%. Excluding these acquisitions, our revenues increased by $849,993, or 43.38%. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of our contract manufacturing services following the easing of pandemic related restrictions. The increase was the result of an increase in the volume of products sold and not due to pricing changes.
Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues for our nutraceutical business consist of ingredients, packaging materials, freight, and labor associated with the production of various products. Cost of revenues for our digital marketing business consist of commissions and bonuses paid to digital marketers. Our total cost of revenues were $6,124,633 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included $3,160,414 from DSO from the period from July 1, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, $528,386 from Nexus for the period from November 8, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021 and $0 from GSP for the period from December 6, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,831,629 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,293,004, or 234.38%. Excluding these acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased by $690,238, or 37.68%. Such increase was due to an increase in the amount of sales during 2021. As a percentage of revenues, our cost of revenues decreased from 93.47% in 2020 to 67.88% in 2021 (or 89.76% excluding the acquisitions) due to reduced costs of materials based on purchasing power.
Gross profit. As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit was $2,897,960 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included $2,437,947 from DSO from the period from July 1, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, $165,636 from Nexus for the period from November 8, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021 and $82 from GSP for the period from December 6, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, as compared to $127,966 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,769,994, or 2,164.63%. Excluding these acquisitions, our gross profit increased by $159,755, or 124.84%. As a percentage of revenues, our gross profit increased from 6.53% in 2020 to 32.12% in 2021 (or 10.24% excluding the acquisitions).
General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including employee salaries and bonuses plus related payroll taxes, advertising expenses, professional advisor fees, bad debts, rent expense, insurance and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our general and administrative expenses were $7,420,856 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included $3,284,538 from DSO from the period from July 1, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, $106.947 from Nexus for the period from November 8, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021 and $583 from GSP for the period from December 6, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,863,087 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5,557,769, or 298.31%. Excluding these acquisitions, our general and administrative expenses increased by $2,166,554, or 116.29%. Such increase was partially due to the addition of corporate office personnel. During 2021, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer and Controller, and the 2021 expense includes the full year compensation for our President and Chief Executive Officer, both of whom were hired during 2020. Additionally, we engaged additional professionals associated with our audits and acquisition targets. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 95.08% in 2020 to 82.25% in 2021 (or 143.42% excluding the acquisitions).
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $717,925, or 7.96% of net revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included $408,730 from DSO from the period from July 1, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, $83,008 from Nexus for the period from November 8, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021 and $8,001 from GSP for the period from December 6, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, as compared to $166,613, or 8.50% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in amortization is associated with intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions.
Total other expense. We had $2,524,702 in total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to total other expense, net, of $1,267,284 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of interest expense of $2,511,920 and other expense of $12,782, while other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of interest expense of $1,253,143 and other expense of $14,141.
Net loss. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss of $7,765,523 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included $1,679,638 from DSO from the period from July 1, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, $22,391 from Nexus for the period from November 8, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021 and $8,705 from GSP for the period from December 6, 2021 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2021, as compared to $3,169,018 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,596,505, or 145.05%. Excluding the acquisitions, our loss increased by $2,868,173, or 90.51%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $205,093. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, bank borrowings and private placements of our securities. Since our inception in 2017, we have experienced losses and as a result have continued to use cash in our operations. We have been dependent upon financing activities as we implement our acquisition strategy.
Although we believe that our current levels of cash will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for our operations for at least the next 12 months, we do believe additional funds are required to execute our business plan and our strategy of acquiring additional companies. As noted elsewhere in this report, over the next 24 months, we plan to acquire multiple companies aggregating a minimum of $100 million in annualized revenues with the number of prospective acquisitions in the pipeline representing over $50 million in additional revenue. The funds required to execute this business plan will depend on the size, capital structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business deems acceptable in a given transaction. The amount of funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase price of a target business the seller of that business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries. As noted elsewhere in this report, we intend on paying no more than 60% cash on any acquisition that we execute with a target of 50%. Given these factors, we believe that the amount of outside additional capital necessary to execute our business plan for the next 24 months ranges from $20 million to $60 million. With respect to the prospective acquisitions in the pipeline representing over $50 million in additional revenue, the amount of capital needed ranges from $10 million to $30 million.
We intend to raise capital for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing at our operating company level, additional equity offerings by our company, or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
There is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional businesses under the terms outlined above or that we will be able to find additional acquisition candidates should we terminate our plans for any of our current acquisition targets.
Summary of Cash Flow
The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Our net cash used in operating activities was $5,019,113 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,903,116 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Interest at a rate of 12% per annum accrued on the principal balance of the debentures from the date of issuance until February 14, 2022, the date that the registration statement related to our initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC (which we refer to as the IPO date).

The conversion price is subject to standard equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock combinations, recapitalizations and similar transactions. The debentures contain beneficial ownership limitations which limit the holders’ beneficial ownership to 9.99% of our outstanding common stock. At any time after the IPO date, we may redeem some or all of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures for cash in an amount equal to 115% of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued but unpaid interest and any other amounts due under the debentures.

Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:
Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2020, we now evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted the new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective method to undelivered performance obligations on existing contracts which resulted in no impact to retained earnings. We evaluate and recognize revenue by: identifying the contract(s) with the customer; identifying the performance obligations in the contract; determining the transaction price; allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer (i.e., “transfer of control”).
Products (BSNM, DSO and GSP)
We primarily generate revenues by manufacturing and packaging of nutraceutical products as a contract manufacturer for customers. The majority of our revenue is recognized when we satisfy a single performance obligation by transferring control of products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when our products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Our general payment terms are short-term in duration. We do not have significant financing components or payment terms. We did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
Distribution expenses to transport our products, where applicable, and warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.
Marketing (Nexus)
Nexus generates revenues when sales of listed products are sold by product vendors through its network as a result of the marketing efforts of digital marketers. The products on the network come from several different customers, which pay Nexus a specific amount per sale, the amount of which is dictated by the customer. The revenue is recognized upon the sale of a product by the customer, net of fraudulent traffic or disputed transactions. A portion of the specific amount received by Nexus for that sale is paid out to the digital marketer as a commission, which is recorded in cost of sales. To illustrate the revenue process, a digital marketer logs onto the platform and selects an offer to promote for the day. The platform generates a unique link which the digital marketer distributes either via email or a banner ad. As the link is distributed to the consumer via the marketing efforts of the digital marketer, the consumer visits that link to make a purchase from the customer’s website, and when such purchase is complete, revenue is recognized by Nexus and the sale is credited to the digital marketer’s Nexus account. The benefit to the digital marketer operating on Nexus’ network is that the digital marketer receives a commission without the possibility of a claw back or refund. The customer benefits through increased sales of its products as a result of the marketing efforts of the digital marketers. Nexus’ platform acts as the transaction ledger, keeping track of clicks, sales and commissions.
Nexus’ general payment terms are short-term in duration. Insertion orders are utilized between Nexus and the customer for each campaign related to a particular product being marketed. The insertion order remains in effect until the customer or Nexus terminates the order, and either party may terminate the order at any time upon 14 days’ written notice. The customer is billed weekly for the sales digital marketers have generated for the week. Nexus does not have significant financing components or payment terms. Nexus did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
Inventory, net. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods and is valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) (replacement cost or net realizable value). An allowance for inventory obsolescence is provided for slow moving or obsolete inventory to write down historical cost to net realizable value. We primarily perform our manufacturing for nutraceuticals in the form of powders, tablets and capsules. The allowance for obsolescence is an estimate established through charges to cost of goods sold. Management’s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based upon several factors which include, but are not limited to, analysis of slow-moving inventory, analysis of the selling price of inventory, the predetermined shelf life of the product, and management’s judgment with respect to current economic conditions. Given the nature of the inventory, it is reasonably possible our estimate of the allowance for obsolescence will change in the near term.
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major betterments and additions are charged to the asset accounts, while replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. We provide for depreciation and amortization over the estimated useful lives of various assets using the straight-line method ranging from 3-15 years.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. In addition to the annual impairment review, impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, and our impairment testing is performed at the operating division level. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment loss will be recognized. No goodwill impairments were recognized during 2021. During 2021, goodwill increased by $1.3 million related to the acquisition of DSO. During 2021, identifiable intangible assets increased by $16.0 million related to acquisitions and declined by $486,184 due to amortization. Intangible assets and goodwill consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, license agreements, goodwill, and intellectual property acquired in the acquisitions of BSNM, DSO, Nexus, and GSP. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which ranges from 3 to 15 years.
Long-Lived Assets. We assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) is less than its carrying amount. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. We had no impairment of long-lived assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Lease Right-of-Use Asset. We record a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified either as finance or operating with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and are discounted using the most reasonable incremental borrowing rate. We use the implicit rate when it is readily determinable. Since our lease does not provide an implicit rate, to determine the present value of lease payments, management uses our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement. Leases with a term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on our balance sheet and are expensed on a straight- line basis over the lease term.
Stock-based Compensation. We recognize expense for stock options and warrants granted over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award at the grant date, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair market value of the stock options. We calculate the amount of tax benefit available by tracking each stock option award on an employee-by-employee basis and on a grant-by-grant basis. We then compare the recorded expense to the tax deduction received for each stock option grant.
