Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and future financial performance, includes forward-looking statements that are based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results and the timing of selected events to differ materially from those described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please also see the section within Part I of this Annual Report entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for cancers with critical unmet medical need. Our development efforts are focused on promising, yet untapped, biological pathways implicated in cancer generation or progression. Our pipeline includes:
• Zilovertamab (formerly cirmtuzumab or UC-961) is an investigational, humanized, potentially first-in-class, monoclonal antibody designed to: (i) inhibit Receptor tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1, or ROR1, a growth factor receptor that is widely expressed on many tumors and that activates pathways leading to increased tumor proliferation, invasiveness and drug resistance, and (ii) bind to a specific functionally important epitope of ROR1.
After reaching an agreement regarding the study design and major details with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), zilovertamab is planned to be evaluated in our potentially pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of zilovertamab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, which is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2022. The Phase 3 clinical trial ZILO-301 is entitled, “Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Phase 3 Study of Zilovertamab (A ROR1 Antibody) Plus Ibrutinib Versus Ibrutinib Plus Placebo in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma.” Zilovertamab is currently being evaluated in the Cirmtuzumab and Ibrutinib for Relapsed Lymphoma or Leukemia, or CIRLL, study, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. As of January 31, 2022, we have completed the enrollment of patients with MCL and CLL in the Phase 1/2 CIRLL study, and those patients are completing therapy or are in long-term follow-up.
In addition, we are supporting two investigator-sponsored studies being conducted at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, or UC San Diego, a: (i) Phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer study, and (ii) Phase 2 clinical trial of zilovertamab in combination with venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
• ONCT-808, our lead cell therapy product candidate, is: (i) an autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell, or CAR-T, therapy that targets ROR1, (ii) in preclinical development as a potential treatment for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, (iii) highly expressed by multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies and confers both an aggressive phenotype and survival advantage to tumor cells, and (iv) being developed in collaboration with the Karolinska Institutet and under agreements with Lentigen Technology, Inc. (lentivirus manufacturing) and Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co. KG. (cell processing). We are performing preclinical activities to support the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which we expect to submit in mid-2022.
• ONCT-534 (formerly GTX-534), a dual action androgen receptor inhibitor, or DAARI, product candidate is in preclinical development as a potential treatment for advanced castration-resistant prostate and other androgen-receptor cancers. This program was acquired in the GTx Merger (described below) and was previously known as the selective androgen receptor degrader, or SARD, program.
• ONCT-216 (formerly TK216) is an investigational small molecule that is designed to inhibit the ETS, or E26 Transformation Specific, family of oncoproteins, has shown in preclinical studies to alter gene transcription and RNA processing and leads to increased cell proliferation and invasion. ONCT-216 is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial as a single agent and in combination with vincristine in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer. The active Phase 2 expansion cohort targeting up to 21 evaluable Ewing sarcoma patients is designed to evaluate clinical responses to single agent ONCT-216 using an optimized dosing regimen, treating patients for 28 days per cycle with the next cycle starting immediately after the prior one, to intensify the amount of ONCT-216 administered over time.
Since the inception of privately-held Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. in 2013, we have devoted most of our resources to organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, acquiring product candidates and securing related intellectual property rights and advancing our zilovertamab and ONCT-216 clinical development programs as well as our ONCT-808 and ONCT-534 preclinical programs. Under research subaward agreements between us and UC San Diego, we are eligible to receive approximately $14.4 million in development milestones during the award project period, estimated to be from October 1, 2017 to March 31, 2022. Through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations primarily through: (i) gross proceeds of $125.0 million from the issuance of common stock, (ii) gross proceeds of $49.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, (iii) receipt of $13.9 million in subaward grant payments received from UC San Diego, and (iv) cash proceeds of $18.3 million received in connection with the closing of the merger with GTx, Inc. in June 2019, or the GTx Merger. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $90.8 million and no debt.
We have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates. Our net loss was $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.1 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with: (i) advancing our research and development programs, (ii) general and administrative costs associated with our operations, including the costs associated with operating as a public company, and (iii) in-process research and development costs associated with the GTX Merger. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital funding requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•
advance zilovertamab through clinical development in multiple indications, with a primary focus in MCL;
•
advance our ROR-1 targeting cell therapy program, which includes ONCT-808 to clinical development, initially in hematological malignancies;
•
generate clinical proof-of-concept data with ONCT-216 in Ewing sarcoma, an orphan pediatric cancer indication;
•
advance ONCT-534 into clinical development, initially in castration resistant prostate cancer and then other AR-driven diseases;
•
respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has slowed enrollment into our clinical trials and impacted our supply chain activities;
•
evaluate zilovertamab in additional ROR1-positive hematologic malignancies;
•
evaluate ONCT-216 in additional malignancies with ETS fusion proteins or overexpression;
•
continue to develop additional product candidates;
•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our planned product development and future commercialization efforts.
We will not generate product sales revenue unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product
candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
As a result, we believe we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our business strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant product sales revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government funding, or other sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. We may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in licenses or acquisitions.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Beyond that point, we will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations, which cannot be assured.
Business Update Regarding COVID-19
The COVID-19 worldwide pandemic has presented substantial public health and economic challenges and continues to affect economies, financial markets and business operations around the world. The pandemic may continue to directly or indirectly affect the timeline for our manufacturing activities, planned IND submissions and clinical trials, including our global Phase 3 study of zilovertamab that we plan to initiate in the second quarter of 2022. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to directly or indirectly impact the our business results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain or treat it, the success or failure of ongoing vaccination programs worldwide, the emergence and spread of additional variants of COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
Components of Results of Operations
Grant Revenue
Our grant revenue has been derived from a California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, grant subaward with UC San Diego and research and development grants from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.
In August 2017, CIRM awarded an $18.3 million grant to researchers at UC San Diego to advance our Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including MCL and CLL. Oncternal is conducting this study in collaboration with UC San Diego and estimates it will receive approximately $14.4 million in development milestones under research subaward agreements throughout the award project period, estimated to be from October 1, 2017 to March 31, 2022. In addition, we are committed to certain co-funding requirements and are required to provide UC San Diego progress and financial update reports throughout the award project period. We received subaward payments of $2.2 million and $1.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we believe we have met our obligations under the CIRM award and UC San Diego subawards.
In August 2021, the NIH awarded the Company two research and development grants for up to $2.2 million to support preclinical activities for the Company’s ONCT-216 and ONCT-534 programs, including $0.7 million payable to subawardees. Under the terms of the grant awards, the Company is entitled to receive reimbursement in arrears of incurring allowable expenditures. The earned NIH funds are non-refundable and the Company is required to provide periodic progress performance reports. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received no award payments from the NIH and recorded $143,000 in grant revenue and unbilled receivables which has been included in prepaid and other assets.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, zilovertamab, ONCT-216, ONCT-808 and ONCT-534, which include:
•
expenses under agreements with third-party contract organizations, investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;
•
costs related to develop and manufacture preclinical study and clinical trial material;
•
salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation;
•
costs incurred under our collaboration and third-party licensing agreements; and
•
laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical and clinical trials.
We accrue all research and development costs in the period for which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, collaborators and third-party service providers. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and then expensed as the related goods are delivered and as services are performed. Any unearned advances would be refunded when known.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we: (i) continue to invest in developing our product candidates preclinically, advance preclinical assets into the clinic and as we begin to conduct larger global clinical trials, and (ii) invest in additional operational personnel to support our planned product development efforts. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, especially for global studies.
Our direct research and development expenses are tracked by product candidate and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid under third-party license agreements and to outside consultants, contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs and costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies and facilities, including other indirect costs, to specific product candidates because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. These employees work across multiple programs and, therefore, we do not track our costs by product candidate unless we can include them as subaward costs.
We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, including any potential expanded dosing beyond the original protocols based in part on ongoing clinical success and the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments of each product candidate’s
commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, insurance costs, facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. Personnel-related costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly as we: (i) incur additional costs associated with being a public company, including audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs, (ii) hire additional personnel, and (iii) protect our intellectual property.
Other Income
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
During 2020, we received a $0.3 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, a program implemented by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. In December 2020, the underlying principal and interest were fully forgiven by the SBA and the Company has no further obligations thereunder. The loan forgiveness was recorded as other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents, which consist of money market funds. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Grant Revenue
Grant revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.3 million, compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $0.9 million was primarily due to an increase in clinical and
manufacturing activities under the CIRM grant subaward and partially due to new operating activities under the NIH awards received in August 2021.
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $24.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, an increase of $11.5 million. The increase was due to: (i) a $6.3 million net increase in direct product candidate costs, and (ii) a $5.2 million increase in unallocated research and development expenses.
Direct expenses for zilovertamab increased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the following partially offsetting factors: (i) a $0.2 million increase in preclinical costs, (ii) a $0.7 million increase in clinical trial costs primarily related to our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib, (iii) a $2.2 million increase in manufacturing development costs related to the supply of clinical drug product, and (iv) a $0.3 million increase in license and milestone fees under the Regents License Agreement, as defined below.
Direct expenses for ONCT-216 increased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to the following offsetting factors: (i) a $0.2 million decrease in clinical trial costs related to our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ONCT-216 in refractory Ewing sarcoma, and (ii) a $0.9 million increase in manufacturing development costs related to the supply of clinical drug product.
Direct expenses for ONCT-808 increased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a: (i) $1.9 million increase in manufacturing and preclinical development costs and, (ii) $0.4 million increase in collaboration agreement costs.
Direct expenses for ONCT-534 increased by a nominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in preclinical costs.
Unallocated expenses increased $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher personnel costs, including higher non-cash share-based compensation expense of $2.6 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $11.6 million and $8.4 million, respectively, an increase of $3.2 million. The increase is primarily due to higher: (i) personnel and professional related costs of $2.5 million, including higher non-cash share-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, (ii) director’s and officer’s insurance costs of $0.4 million, and (iii) public company and other expenses of $0.3 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.1 million and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2021, we had $90.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. We believe we have sufficient cash to fund our projected operating requirements into mid-2023.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our net cash flow activity for each of the periods presented (in thousands):
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $26.6 million, resulting from our net loss of $31.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $6.0 million related to stock-based compensation and lease expense. The net loss of $31.3 million was driven by our ongoing clinical development activities partially offset by grant revenue. The $1.3 million change in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of the following activities, a: (i) $1.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, (ii) $0.9 million increase in prepaid and other assets and operating lease liability, and (iii) $1.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $17.5 million, resulting from our net loss of $17.2 million, which included net non-cash charges of $1.4 million related to stock-based compensation, lease expense, and forgiveness of the paycheck protection program loan, offset by a $1.7 million change in our operating assets and liabilities. The net loss of $17.2 million was driven by our ongoing clinical development activities partially offset by grant revenue. The $1.7 million change in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of the following partially offsetting activities: (i) a $2.0 million decrease in deferred revenue, (ii) a $0.7 million increase in prepaid and other assets and operating lease liability, and (iii) a $1.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Investing Activities
No cash was used or provided by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Financing Activities
Financing activities provided net cash of $0.6 million for year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of net proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants.
Financing activities provided net cash of $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of $113.9 million in net proceeds received from various public offerings.
Operating Capital Requirements
We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and conduct additional research and development activities. Our product candidates have not yet achieved regulatory approval and we may not be successful in achieving commercialization of our product candidates.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents as of March 10, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into mid-2023. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our planned operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. For example, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to generate additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may impose other requirements beyond those that we currently anticipate. Additionally, it is possible for a product candidate to show promising results in preclinical studies or in clinical trials, but fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties and the probability of success, the duration and the cost of our research and development activities required to advance a product candidate cannot be accurately estimated and are subject to considerable variation. We may encounter difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors and unforeseen expenses in the course of our research and development activities, any of which may significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely affect our liquidity.
We will require additional capital for the research and development of our product candidates, and we may be forced to seek additional funds sooner than expected to pursue our research and development activities. We expect to finance our capital requirements in the foreseeable future through a combination of the sale of public or private equity or debt securities, government funding, or other sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we can raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.
Our forecast of the period of time through which our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves significant risks and uncertainties. We have based this forecast on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and actual results could vary materially from our expectations, which may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity. We could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including clinical trial delays;
•
the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of our clinical trials of zilovertamab and ONCT-216, and preclinical studies or clinical trials of our ROR1 CAR-T and DAARI product candidates or additional indications of our current product candidates as well as other product candidates that we may choose to pursue in the future;
•
the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;
•
the costs of obtaining ibrutinib, for which we currently obtain supply at no cost under our clinical supply agreement with Pharmacyclics, to conduct our clinical trials of zilovertamab;
•
the costs and capacity for CAR-T development and lentivirus manufacturing;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of seeking and obtaining worldwide regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
•
the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;
•
the costs associated with hiring additional personnel, CROs and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;
•
our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products;
•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, including milestone or other payments under our existing in-license agreements and any in-license agreements that we may enter into in the future;
•
costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and
•
the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for, and the pricing and reimbursement of, any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
If we cannot continue or expand our research and development operations, or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
In December 2021, we entered into the ATM Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we are able to offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement. Through December 31, 2021, we have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement.
Under current SEC regulations, if at any time our public float is less than $75.0 million, and for so long as our public float remains less than $75.0 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the baby shelf rules. As of December 31, 2021, our calculated public float exceeded $75.0 million. In April 2021, our Form S-3 registration statement became effective. Future sales of our common stock, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the expected timing for achieving key milestones, including initiating, completing and announcing results of clinical trials of zilovertamab and ONCT-216 and announcing the first-in-human dosing of our CAR-T product candidate targeting ROR-1, currently in preclinical development, prevailing market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating future sales of our securities based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We are party to a number of license agreements, pursuant to which we have payment obligations that are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and are required to make royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under those agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or making future product sales. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a description of these agreements.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical trial sites and clinical supply manufacturers and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts.
Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods.
Our estimates are based on our historical trends and other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1, “Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. However, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical for fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
Research and Development Expenses and Accruals
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. Certain service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known
to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to: (i) CROs and other third parties in connection with clinical studies and preclinical development activities; (ii) investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; and (iii) third parties related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to CROs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.

We generate revenue from certain grant awards or a subaward (the “Grant Awards”) (see Note 4), which provide us with payments in return for certain research and development activities over a contractually defined period. Revenue from Grant Awards is recognized in the period during which the related qualifying services are rendered and costs are incurred, provided that the applicable conditions under the Grant Awards have been met.
The Grant Awards are on a best-effort basis and do not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation. The Grant Awards are nonrefundable. The costs associated with the Grant Awards are expensed as incurred and reflected as a component of research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Funds received from the Grant Awards are recorded as revenue as we are the principal participant in the arrangement because the activities under the Grant Awards are part of our development programs. In those instances where we first receive consideration in advance of providing underlying services, we classify such consideration as deferred revenue until (or as) we provide the underlying services. In those instances where we first provide the underlying services prior to receipt of consideration, we record a grant receivable.
