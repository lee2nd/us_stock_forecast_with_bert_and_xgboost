Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel, potentially life-changing medicines based on scientific understanding of key biological pathways underlying retinal diseases, cancer and liver and metabolic diseases. These diseases represent a significant burden for patients and healthcare systems and, in some cases, are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Since the commencement of our operations in 2008, we have generated a robust portfolio of product candidates ranging from early discovery to Phase 2b development. Currently, we have seven disclosed programs, including four in Phase 2 or 2b studies, across three therapeutic areas: cancer, retinal diseases and liver and metabolic diseases. Our biology-centric drug discovery approach aims to seamlessly integrate interrogation of complex disease-associated biology and protein engineering expertise to unlock proprietary insights that are leveraged to generate promising product candidates and enable their rapid advancement into proof-of-concept studies. As explorers on the frontier of life-changing science, we aspire to operate one of the most productive research and development engines in the biopharmaceutical industry. All therapeutic candidates in our pipeline have been generated by our in-house therapeutic area-agnostic discovery engine, led by biology and motivated by unmet patient need.
Pipeline Programs and Operational Updates
Pipeline Programs
We currently have five product candidates in the clinic, three wholly-owned by us (NGM707, NGM120 and aldafermin), one being progressed by our collaborator, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck (MK-3655) and one optionable by Merck (NGM621). In addition, we have two wholly-owned product candidates expected to enter the clinic in the first half of 2022:
•Oncology. Our oncology product candidates NGM707, NGM831, NGM438 and NGM120 and their related compounds are wholly-owned by us.
◦NGM707. NGM707, the lead asset in our myeloid reprogramming and checkpoint inhibition portfolio, is a dual antagonist monoclonal antibody that is designed to improve patient immune responses to tumors by inhibiting both Immunoglobulin-like transcript 2, or ILT2 (also known as LILRB1), and Immunoglobulin-like transcript 4, or ILT4 (also known as LILRB2) receptors. We believe NGM707 has the potential to reprogram ILT4- and ILT2-expressing myeloid cells to shift them from a suppressive state that restricts anti-tumor immunity to a stimulatory state that may promote anti-tumor immunity. Blocking ILT2 may also reverse inhibition of ILT2-expressing lymphoid cells to further stimulate anti-tumor immune responses.
▪In June 2021, we initiated the open-label, Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating NGM707 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. We expect to enroll approximately 180 patients in this trial. The ongoing Phase 1a cohort of the trial is evaluating NGM707 as a monotherapy. The Phase 1b cohort will evaluate NGM707 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
▪Looking forward: We anticipate a readout of initial data from the Phase 1a cohort in the second half of 2022. The Phase 1 portion of the trial is expected to be followed by a Phase 2 dose-expansion in cohorts of specific tumor types.
◦NGM831. In August 2021, we disclosed NGM831, an antagonist antibody that is designed to block the interaction of the Immunoglobulin-like transcript 3, or ILT3 (also known as LILRB4) receptor, with fibronectin, as well as other cognate ligands. For tumors in which both ILT3 and fibronectin are upregulated, the ILT3-fibronectin signaling pathway may act as a stromal checkpoint to repress myeloid cell function and inhibit anti-tumor immunity. By inhibiting ILT3's interaction with fibronectin and its other ligands, we believe NGM831 has the potential to mobilize a patient's own immune system to fight tumors by shifting myeloid cells from a suppressive state to a stimulatory state and promoting antitumor activity.
▪The disclosure of NGM831 coincided with a publication in Cancer Immunology Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, describing our discovery of one of ILT3's functional ligands, fibronectin, a key component of the tumor stroma.
▪Looking forward: We expect to initiate first-in-human testing of NGM831 in patients with advanced solid tumors in the first quarter of 2022.
◦NGM438. NGM438 is an antagonist antibody that is designed to inhibit leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1, or LAIR1, and thereby promote anti-tumor immune responses. NGM438 has the potential to potently block the binding of all collagens to LAIR1, including tumor-derived collagens. Collagens produced by the tumor stroma are believed to bind LAIR1 to create an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment. The interaction of collagens from the tumor stroma with LAIR1 on immune cells represents a “stromal checkpoint” that restrains anti-tumor immune responses. Reinvigoration of these collagen-suppressed immune cells by blocking the binding of collagens to LAIR1 may address a key resistance mechanism that limits tumor responses to current immunotherapies.
▪Looking forward: We expect to initiate first-in-human testing of NGM438 in patients with advanced solid tumors in the second quarter of 2022.
◦NGM120. NGM120 is an antagonist antibody that binds to glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like, or GFRAL, and is designed to block the effects of elevated serum levels of growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15. We designed NGM120 as a potent, humanized monoclonal antibody inhibitor of GFRAL with the potential for once-monthly or less frequent dosing. Preclinical studies suggest that NGM120 may reduce tumor growth and improve survival in syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic tumor models.
▪We are conducting the Phase 1/2 PINNACLES clinical trial to assess NGM120’s effect on cancer and cancer-related cachexia in patients with select advanced solid tumors and metastatic pancreatic cancer. We are currently enrolling patients into a Phase 2 component of the ongoing PINNACLES clinical trial. This Phase 2 component of the PINNACLES trial is testing NGM120 in combination with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
▪In September 2021, at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Virtual Congress, we reported preliminary findings from two Phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts of the PINNACLES trial, including a Phase 1a cohort evaluating NGM120 as a monotherapy in patients with select advanced solid tumors and a Phase 1b cohort evaluating NGM120 in combination with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The preliminary results reported at ESMO showed that NGM120 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and provided encouraging initial signals of anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.
▪Looking forward: We plan to report additional data from the Phase 1a and Phase 1b cohorts of the PINNACLES trial in the second half of 2022.
•Retinal diseases.
◦NGM621. NGM621 is a humanized Immunoglobulin 1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody administered via intravitreal, or IVT, injection. NGM621 was engineered to potently bind to, and be a long-acting inhibitor of, complement C3 with the treatment goal of reducing disease progression in patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
▪Data from a Phase 1 trial we conducted showed that NGM621 was well tolerated, with no patients experiencing serious adverse events, or SAEs, or drug-related adverse events. Ocular adverse events observed were mild in severity and representative of those commonly associated with IVT injections.
▪In July 2021, we completed enrollment of the ongoing Phase 2 CATALINA clinical trial, enrolling 320 patients at 65 sites in the United States. The CATALINA trial was designed to be a Phase 3-supportive or -enabling clinical trial and is evaluating the efficacy and safety of NGM621 when given to patients with GA every four weeks or every eight weeks via IVT injections compared to sham control.
▪In February 2022, NGM621 received Fast Track designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
▪Looking forward: We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 CATALINA trial in the fourth quarter of 2022. We plan to use the CATALINA trial results and guidance from the FDA
to inform Phase 3 planning and design for NGM621. Merck has a one-time option to license NGM621 and its related compounds upon completion of the ongoing Phase 2 CATALINA clinical trial (either alone or bundled with all of the other ophthalmology compounds and their respective related compounds included within the scope of the current collaboration with Merck).
•Liver and metabolic diseases.
◦Aldafermin. Aldafermin is an engineered analog of human hormone fibroblast growth factor 19, or FGF19, that is administered through a once-daily subcutaneous injection. Aldafermin is wholly-owned by us. In May 2021, we announced that the ALPINE 2/3 Phase 2b trial of aldafermin in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and liver fibrosis stage 2 or 3, or or, did not meet its primary endpoint. As a result, we decided to suspend further development of aldafermin in patients with/F3 NASH, allowing for the reallocation of resources to advancing our other programs. Aldafermin remains in Phase 2b development in the ALPINE 4 trial for the treatment of patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis (liver fibrosis stage 4, or).
▪In January 2022, we completed enrollment of 160 patients in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong and Australia in our Phase 2b ALPINE 4 clinical trial of aldafermin. The ALPINE 4 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the treatment effect of aldafermin over 48 weeks in a population of patients with NASH with liver fibrosis and well-compensated cirrhosis. We recently updated the design of the ALPINE 4 trial, elevating the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, or ELF, test, a reproducible, quantitative non-invasive liver prognostic test that evaluates liver fibrosis and correlates to liver-related outcomes, to be the primary endpoint for the trial. The ELF test is a composite blood test measuring the presence of three biomarkers associated with liver matrix metabolism. Liver biopsy data will also be measured and reported as a secondary endpoint upon completion of the trial.
▪Looking forward: We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 ALPINE 4 trial in the first half of 2023.
◦MK-3655 (formerly NGM313). MK-3655 is an agonistic antibody discovered by us that selectively activates fibroblast growth factor receptor 1c-beta-klotho, or FGFR1c/KLB, which regulates insulin sensitivity, blood glucose and liver fat and is administered every four weeks through a subcutaneous injection. MK-3655, in Phase 2b development for the treatment of NASH, was licensed by Merck in November 2018.
▪Merck is continuing enrollment in the worldwide 52-week randomized, double-blind Phase 2b trial of MK-3655 in patients with NASH and or liver fibrosis that it initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We have additional undisclosed programs that are in various stages of development ranging from functional validation to preclinical development.
The success of each of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability, sales capability, collaboration partners, the sufficiency of our cash resources, regulatory matters, third-party payor matters and commercial viability. We do not have any products approved for sale and do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future, if ever.
Operational Updates
Partnering has been and is expected to continue to be a key component of our strategy. For example, our collaboration with Merck, described in " - Our Merck Collaboration" below, historically provided us with robust financial support that enabled us to broaden and accelerate our research efforts and to develop more product candidates for major indications than we likely could have advanced on our own. Given the breadth of opportunities produced by our prolific discovery engine, and the narrower scope of our Merck collaboration going forward, we may decide to pursue additional strategic partners to progress, in whole or in part, some of our wholly-owned product candidates and/or commercialize any resulting approved product.
We do not own, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. All of our manufacturing activities are outsourced to third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations or third-party contract manufacturing organizations, which we refer to collectively as CMOs, which are generally single-source suppliers of the drug product or drug substance they are manufacturing for us. We also utilize third-party contract research
organizations, or CROs, to carry out many of our clinical development activities. We expect to be reliant on CMOs and CROs for these activities for the foreseeable future. Significant portions of our research and development, or R&D, resources are focused, and will continue to be focused, on the manufacture and testing of clinical trial materials. If our CROs and CMOs fail to satisfy their contractual duties to us or meet expected deadlines or if our CMOs experience difficulties in scaling production, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated yields, product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, turnover of qualified staff or improper storage conditions, difficulties with quality control, product stability or quality assurance testing, or difficulties procuring raw materials or components as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our ongoing and planned trials and possible acceleration or expansion of those trials may be delayed, perhaps substantially, or abandoned, which could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, while we expect to commence first-in-human testing of NGM831 in the first quarter of 2022 and of NGM438 in the second quarter of 2022, our planned individual new drug application, or IND, submissions for NGM438 and NGM831 were delayed due to challenges at one of our CMOs with respect to the manufacture of those product candidates, primarily related to analytical method qualification and release testing. It is possible that we could experience further supply-related delays that would create supply challenges and possible timing delays for ongoing and planned clinical trials or delay the commencement of first-in-human testing of future product candidates. In addition, there is increased competition in the biotechnology industry for CMO manufacturing slots and other capabilities generally, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the availability of manufacturing capacity and therefore our ability to supply clinical trial materials for planned, ongoing, accelerated or expanded clinical trials. Our CMOs’ facilities and operations have also been adversely affected by labor, raw material and component shortages, high turnover of staff and difficulties in hiring trained and qualified replacement staff. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, labor, raw material and component shortages and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs, could lead to higher inflation than previously experienced or expected, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in costs. These supply chain effects, increased competition and higher costs of acquired goods and services may negatively impact our business operations and our financial results.
In addition, all of our product candidates other than aldafermin and MK-3655 are currently manufactured at a facility in Lithuania. At the end of 2021 and into 2022, tensions between Russia and the United States and its allies escalated when Russia amassed large numbers of military ground forces and support personnel on the Ukraine-Russia border and, in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. While the situation is evolving and fluid at the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the response from the United States and its allies has included both economic sanctions and NATO's deployment of additional military forces to Eastern Europe, including to Lithuania. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures taken or that may be taken by the United States, NATO and others create global security concerns, including the possibility of expanded regional or global conflict, and are likely to have short-term and likely longer-term negative impacts on regional and global economies, any or all of which could disrupt our supply chain and adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidates and our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.
We seek to allocate our capital efficiently and strategically and fund our portfolio based on each program’s scientific and other merits. Our discipline has been demonstrated by our decision not to proceed with development activities on multiple potentially viable product candidates for portfolio management reasons to concentrate our resources on what we consider our most promising product candidates. However, given the substantial decrease in research funding we will receive from Merck beginning in 2022 commensurate with the decreased collaboration scope described below, going forward we will need to devote a substantial amount of our own financial resources to our R&D programs, and we may need to delay or suspend development activities on product candidates that we consider promising unless and until we are able to raise sufficient additional capital and/or we will need to enter into additional collaborations in order to proceed with such development through to regulatory approval.
Our Merck Collaboration
In 2015, we entered into a research collaboration, product development and license agreement with Merck, which, together with amendments made prior to June 30, 2021, is referred to as the Original Collaboration Agreement, covering the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies across a range of therapeutic areas, including a broad, multi-year drug discovery and early development program financially supported by Merck, but scientifically directed by us with input from Merck. The original research phase of the collaboration was for five years and was extended for an additional two years by Merck through March 2022. As part of that extension, Merck agreed to continue to fund up to $75.0 million of our R&D efforts each year consistent with the initial five-year research term and, in lieu of a $20.0 million extension fee payable to us, Merck agreed to make
additional payments totaling up to $20.0 million in support of our R&D activities during 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
On June 30, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated research collaboration, product development and license agreement with Merck, or the Amended Collaboration Agreement, replacing the Original Collaboration Agreement and extending the research phase of the collaboration, but with a narrower scope than in the Original Collaboration Agreement. Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, the collaboration is focused primarily on the identification, R&D of collaboration compounds directed to targets of interest to Merck in the fields of ophthalmology and cardiovascular or metabolic, or CVM, disease, including heart failure. The ophthalmology compounds in the collaboration include NGM621 (and its related compounds) and compounds directed against two other undisclosed ophthalmology targets (and their related compounds). The collaboration scope also includes certain laboratory testing and other activities on compounds that are directed to one of up to two undisclosed targets outside of the fields of ophthalmology and CVM disease, or the Lab Programs. The research phase will now continue generally through March 31, 2024, with possible extensions for each of the various programs to allow us or Merck to complete ongoing development.
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, Merck committed to provide up to $86.0 million in R&D funding for the four calendar quarters ending March 31, 2022. Merck is providing significantly more limited annual R&D funding beginning in 2022. For the period starting on April 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, Merck will provide up to $20.0 million of R&D funding for the ophthalmology programs (other than NGM621), the CVM-related programs and the Lab Programs. If the parties mutually agree to extend the research phase for the CVM-related programs from March 31, 2024 to March 31, 2026, then Merck will provide up to a total of $20.0 million in R&D funding during the additional two years of the CVM program research phase. Merck will also fund certain R&D costs related to NGM621 in an amount expected to be up to approximately $20.0 million, until the earlier of Merck's decision to exercise, or not to exercise, its License Option with respect to NGM621 alone or bundled with the other continuing ophthalmology compounds (as described below and in "Business - Our Collaboration with Merck - Description of Amended Collaboration Agreement" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) or, March 31, 2024.
In addition, we have certain obligations to conduct R&D related to collaboration compounds that will not be reimbursed by Merck. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop a specific product candidate directed to an ophthalmology target to be ready by March 31, 2023 for starting investigational new drug application-, or IND-, enabling studies and we are responsible for the cost of such work after March 2022. We will have additional R&D funding obligations under the collaboration of up to $5.0 million or $15.0 million in the event that Merck, as described in greater detail below, exercises its License Option to NGM621 alone or bundled with the other continuing ophthalmology compounds, respectively, and pays us the applicable option exercise fee. We also may spend more than the amounts we will be reimbursed by Merck for activities related to collaboration compounds, including certain NGM621 costs necessary to avoid delays in Phase 3 readiness.
Under the Original Collaboration Agreement, upon the completion of each proof-of-concept clinical trial under the program, Merck had a one-time option to obtain a worldwide, exclusive license to the product candidate tested in the trial and compounds related to it, referred to as a License Option. Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, Merck retains a License Option to each collaboration compound and its related compounds upon completion of a human proof-of-concept trial for a particular collaboration compound, regardless of the results of such trial, or at earlier points as specified in the Amended Collaboration Agreement, including the option to license NGM621 and its related compounds upon completion of a human proof-of-concept trial (either alone or bundled with all of the other ophthalmology collaboration compounds and their respective related compounds included within the scope of the Amended Collaboration Agreement). For each program for which Merck exercises its License Option and pays the applicable option exercise fee, Merck is responsible for any further development and commercialization activities for the licensed compounds and we have the option, when a licensed compound has advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials, to receive milestones and royalty payments or, in certain cases, to co-fund development and participate in a global cost and profit share arrangement of up to 50%, with an additional option to co-detail any such licensed compounds in the United States. If Merck does not exercise a License Option within the specified time period, then we would be free to develop and commercialize the product candidate tested in the proof-of-concept trial and its related compounds independently or with third-party partners, subject to an obligation to make low single-digit royalty payments to Merck. Merck exercised its License Option for MK-3655 and its related FGFR1c/KLB agonists in November 2018 under the Original Collaboration Agreement.
As a result of entering into the Amended Collaboration Agreement, we have the right to independently research, develop and commercialize all of the clinical, preclinical and research assets that we researched or developed under the Original Collaboration Agreement that are now outside the narrower scope of the collaboration,
including NGM707, NGM831, NGM438 and NGM120, subject to an obligation to make low single-digit royalty payments to Merck. The parties’ rights and obligations remain the same with respect to MK-3655 and its related FGFR1c/KLB agonists. We also have full rights to all future programs we pursue that fall outside of the scope of the specific therapeutic areas and programs included in Amended Collaboration Agreement.
Similar to the Original Collaboration Agreement, during the applicable research phase (including any applicable tail period for each program as described in "Business - Our Collaboration with Merck - Description of Amended Collaboration Agreement" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for the ophthalmology programs, CVM-related programs and Lab Programs, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, any product with specified activity against any target that is being researched or developed under the applicable programs and, if Merck exercises its License Option for a program, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any product with specified activity against the target that is the subject of that program for so long as Merck’s license to it remains in effect. In addition, under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, we are prohibited from directly or indirectly researching, developing or commercializing any product for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, during the research phase for the CVM-related programs.
Because, under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, the level of R&D funding from Merck will be substantially lower on an annual and overall basis beginning in 2022 than the R&D funding previously provided by Merck, we will need to devote a substantial amount of our own financial resources to our R&D programs, particularly with respect to our wholly-owned programs, and, to a lesser extent, with respect to programs that are within the scope of the collaboration under the Amended Collaboration Agreement that we are required to fund. In addition, our funding requirements would increase for any programs that are within the scope of the current collaboration in the event Merck does not elect to license these programs and we decide to continue them, in the event Merck elects to terminate its license to any program it licenses and we decide to continue it or in the event we opt to co-develop any Merck-licensed programs. Accordingly, we will need to raise significant additional capital and/or we will need to enter into additional collaborations in order to proceed with development through regulatory approval and commercialization of our current and potential future product candidates. Neither may be possible and, as a result, if adequate funds are not available when we need them, we may need to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue development of some or all of such product candidates or scale back or discontinue discovery efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects, or we may be required to cease operations altogether.
For more information on the terms of the Amended Collaboration Agreement, see "Business - Our Collaboration with Merck - Description of Amended Collaboration Agreement" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5, “Research Collaboration and License Agreements,” of the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial Highlights
Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through:
•fees received from collaboration partners, primarily Merck, which since inception through December 31, 2021 includes reimbursement of R&D expenses of $497.7 million, and upfront cash licensing fees of $123.0 million, primarily from Merck, and a payment of $20.0 million from Merck to license MK-3655 and related compounds;
•proceeds from private placements of convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, including approximately $106.0 million of our Series E convertible preferred stock purchased by Merck;
•net proceeds from our IPO in 2019 of approximately $107.8 million, together with proceeds from the concurrent private placement of shares of common stock to Merck of $65.9 million;
•net proceeds of $22.1 million from sales of 817,100 shares of our common stock under an Open Market Sale AgreementSM, or the Sales Agreement, we entered into with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, in June 2020 (809,700 shares sold at an average price of $27.94 per share in December 2020 and 7,400 shares sold at an average price of $27.22 per share in September 2021); and
•net proceeds of $134.6 million from the sale of 5,324,074 shares of our common stock in January 2021 upon completion of an underwritten public offering of our common stock, or the follow-on offering, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares.
At December 31, 2021, we had $366.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities.
We have incurred net losses each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $419.0 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our R&D programs and general and administrative, or G&A, costs associated with our operations. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenses on other R&D activities, and the amount of R&D funding we receive from Merck or future collaboration partners, if any, particularly after March 2022. For further discussion of our financial position and future sources of funding, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
COVID-19 Business Update
We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and have taken and continue to take proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our patients, employees, clinical trial investigators and site staff, while maintaining business continuity. Following guidance from federal, state and local authorities, we operated with a primarily remote work model from March 2020 through October 2021, under which employees working on site were mostly individuals conducting essential in-person laboratory work and other business functions considered essential under COVID-19 regulations and guidance, while others worked remotely. In October 2021, we allowed additional employees to return to onsite work. With the increased rate of transmission experienced with the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant in early 2022, we pivoted to temporarily discouraging in-person meetings and presence on site unless necessary to perform one’s job responsibilities. There were relatively minor impacts on overall productivity as we operated under a remote work model and under our current hybrid work model. However, the labor market has tightened significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have experienced employee attrition at rates higher than we experienced historically, together with an increased rate of hiring new employees. We cannot predict whether these trends will continue or be exacerbated, the impact of COVID-19 on future productivity or whether or when we may be required to return to a more restrictive work model as the pandemic continues to evolve.
For patients enrolled in our clinical trials, we work closely with clinical trial investigators and site staff with the goal of continuing treatment in a manner designed to uphold trial integrity, while allowing some flexibility in the manner and timing of patient visits, and to observe government and institutional guidelines designed to safeguard the health and safety of patients, clinical trial investigators and site staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, from time to time, a slower pace of clinical trial site initiation and clinical trial enrollment than originally anticipated in certain of our clinical trials, and we experienced a higher subject dropout rate in our aldafermin ALPINE 2/3 trial than we had anticipated based on our previous trials in patients with NASH. We believe this may be due to factors such as the vulnerability of our studied patient populations, clinical trial site suspensions, reallocation of medical resources, site staff shortages and the challenges of working remotely due to shelter-in-place and similar government orders and guidelines, among other factors.
We have been proactively working to mitigate these and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by monitoring site initiations, patient enrollment and patient study adherence to provide support to patients and trial staff, often on a case-by-case and/or patient-by-patient basis. For example, we have developed and implemented additional clinical study policies and procedures designed to help protect trial participants from exposure to COVID-19 as a result of their trial participation, which include the use of telemedicine visits with trial participants, remote monitoring of clinical trial sites and other measures, as appropriate, designed to ensure that data from our clinical trials that may be temporarily disrupted as a result of safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic are collected pursuant to the study protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, with any material protocol deviation reviewed and approved by the clinical trial sites' institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees. Most of our clinical trial sites, both within and outside of the United States, continue to screen patients in our clinical trials, and new patients are being enrolled when appropriate. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet resulted in a significant impact to our disclosed clinical development timelines, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there may continue to be negative impacts on our ability to initiate new clinical trial sites, to enroll new patients and to retain existing patients participating in our clinical trials. These negative impacts may include increased clinical trial costs, longer timelines and delay in our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates, if at all.
We also could see an adverse impact on our ability to report clinical trial results, or interact with or receive a timely response from regulators, IRBs and ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in health authority employee resources or otherwise. Moreover, we rely on CROs and other third parties to assist us with clinical development activities, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, while we have not yet experienced significant disruption to drug or related component supply for our ongoing clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our contract manufacturers' facilities and operations have been adversely affected by labor, raw material and component shortages, high turnover of staff and difficulties in hiring trained and qualified replacement staff. These difficulties have resulted in some delays in early development timelines and we could experience more significant disruptions to our supply chain and operations as a result of the evolving effects of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. If our contract manufacturers are required to obtain an alternative source of certain raw materials and components, for example, additional testing, validation activities and regulatory approvals may be required, which can also have a negative impact on timelines. Any associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidates on our anticipated development timelines. For example, early in the pandemic, our aldafermin drug product manufacturer advised us that it could be required under orders of the U.S. government to allocate manufacturing capacity to the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. If any of our contract manufacturers or raw materials or components suppliers become subject to acts or orders of U.S. or foreign government entities requiring them to allocate or prioritize manufacturing capacity, raw materials and components to the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines or medical supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients, this could delay our clinical trials, perhaps substantially, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
While the potential economic impact caused by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, and our ability to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings may be adversely impacted by disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, and in the biotechnology industry specifically, which could negatively affect the financial resources available to us. In addition, economic recession or additional market corrections resulting from, among other things, the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. Finally, we also cannot predict how the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may influence the future decisions of Merck to license any programs available to it under the Amended Collaboration Agreement. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial Operations Overview
Related Party Revenue
Our revenue to date has been generated primarily from recognition of license fees and R&D services funded pursuant to our collaboration with Merck. Merck is also a significant stockholder and, as such, collaboration revenue from Merck is referred to as related party revenue.
Since the Company's inception through December 31, 2021, Merck paid us $572.9 million pursuant to the terms of our collaboration. Due to the nature of our collaboration with Merck and the timing of related revenue recognition, our revenue has fluctuated from period to period in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in future periods, particularly beginning in April 2022, given the substantial decrease in the level of funding we will receive from Merck under with the Amended Collaboration Agreement commensurate with the decreased collaboration scope. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenue may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance.
We use the cost-based input method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, or ASC 606, to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize at each reporting period. In applying the cost-based input measure of revenue recognition, we measure actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs to fulfill our performance obligation. We apply considerable judgment when we re-evaluate the estimate of expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation each reporting period and make adjustments for any significant changes. A significant change in the estimate of expected costs under the Amended Collaboration Agreement could have a material impact on revenue recognized (including the possible reversal of previously recognized revenue) at each reporting period.
In the past three years, our related party revenue was as follows (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
R&D efforts include drug discovery and other research activities and development activities relating to our product candidates, such as manufacturing drug substance, drug product and other clinical trial materials, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing support for these operations. Our R&D expenses consist of both internal and external costs. Our internal costs include employee, consultant, facility and other R&D operating expenses. Our external costs include fees paid to CROs and other service providers in connection with our clinical trials and preclinical studies, third-party license fees and CMO costs related to manufacturing drug substance, drug product and other clinical trial materials.
Our R&D efforts are extensive and costly. Our R&D expenses related to the development of our product candidates consist primarily of:
•fees paid to our CROs in connection with our clinical trials and other related clinical trial fees, when applicable;
•costs related to acquiring and manufacturing drug substance, drug product and clinical trial materials, and the costs of continued testing, such as process validation testing and stability testing, of drug substance and drug product;
•costs related to toxicology testing and other research- and preclinical-related studies;
•salaries and related overhead expenses, which include stock-based compensation and benefits, for personnel in R&D functions;
•fees paid to consultants for R&D activities;
•R&D operating expenses, including facility costs and depreciation expenses; and
•costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements.
As a result of the substantial decrease in the level of funding we will receive from Merck under with the Amended Collaboration Agreement commensurate with the decreased collaboration scope as described above, beginning in 2022, we will need to devote a substantial amount of our own financial resources to our development programs, particularly with respect to our wholly-owned programs and, to a lesser extent, with respect to programs that are within the scope of the Amended Collaboration Agreement that we are required to fund, as described above. In addition, our funding requirements would increase for any programs that are within the scope of the collaboration in the event Merck does not elect to license these programs and we decide to continue them, in the event Merck elects to terminate its license to any program it licenses and we decide to continue it or in the event we opt to co-develop any Merck-licensed programs. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate a significant portion of our financial resources, other than those received from Merck which are dedicated to activities under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, will be directed to activities required to advance initiate and advance clinical trials of our oncology programs, to prepare for the manufacture of NGM621 in anticipation of a potential Phase 3 trial and to complete the Phase 2b ALPINE 4 clinical trial of aldafermin.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medicines, including the uncertainty of:
•our ability to hire and retain key R&D personnel;
•manufacturing scale-up challenges, production shortages or other supply disruptions for clinical trial materials, including raw materials and components;
•the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, patients, clinical trial sites and our CROs, CMOs and other service providers;
•the timely and quality performance of our CROs, CMOs and other service providers;
•whether Merck will elect to license, or to terminate its license, to any of our programs within the scope of the collaboration and the timing of such election or termination;
•the amount of our financial resources that we will need to devote to our development programs and our obligations under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, and our ability to raise adequate additional capital or enter into collaborations to meet our funding requirements;
•the effect of products that may compete with our product candidates or other market developments;
•our ability to expand and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;
•the scope, rate of progress, results and expense of our ongoing, as well as any future, clinical trials and other R&D-related activities; and
•the impact and timing of any interactions with regulatory authorities, including timing and receipt of regulatory approvals.
A change in the outcome of any of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs, as well as the timing, associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or a comparable foreign health authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. For additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our R&D efforts, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,” “-Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties,” “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approvals” and "-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
General and Administrative Expenses
G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and benefits. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, facility costs not otherwise included in R&D expenses and fees for accounting and other consulting services.
We anticipate that our G&A expenses will increase in the future to support our continued and increasing R&D activities. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, as well as fees paid to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we anticipate continued increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and related Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements and costs related to insurance, investor relations and compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with negotiating and entering into agreements with collaboration partners and with building a commercial organization in connection with, and prior to, potential future regulatory approval of our product candidates.
Results of Operations
Our results of operations were as follows (in thousands):
Related Party Revenue from Merck
Revenue decreased $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a reduction in revenue of $4.6 million for an amount we had recorded under the prior two-year extension of the research phase that was no longer billable to Merck under the Amended Collaboration Agreement as of June 30, 2021 and a $3.9 million decrease related to the recognition of the remaining portion of an upfront payment in the first quarter of 2020.
Revenue decreased $16.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $14.9 million related to the recognition of a portion of the initial upfront payment received from Merck that was included within the transaction price and recognized over the initial five-year term of our Collaboration Agreement using the cost-based input model. The initial five-year term ended in the first quarter of 2020.
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, for the period starting on April 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, Merck will provide up to $20.0 million of R&D funding for the ophthalmology programs (other than NGM621), the CVM-related programs and the Lab Programs. If the parties mutually agree to extend the research phase for the CVM-related programs from March 31, 2024 to March 31, 2026, then Merck will provide up to a total of $20.0 million in R&D funding during the additional two years of the CVM program research phase. Merck will also fund certain R&D costs related to NGM621 in an amount expected to be up to approximately $20.0 million, until the earlier of Merck's decision to exercise, or not to exercise, its License Option with respect to NGM621 alone or bundled with the other continuing ophthalmology compounds, or, March 31, 2024. In this regard, we expect our related party revenue from Merck will decrease substantially in 2022 compared to 2021 and continue to remain at a significantly lower level during the remainder of the collaboration.
Due to the nature of our collaboration with Merck and the timing of related revenue recognition, our revenue has fluctuated from period to period in the past and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in future periods, particularly after March 2022.
Research and Development Expenses
Our R&D expenses by program were as follows (in thousands):
_________________
(1) Internal and unallocated R&D expenses consist primarily of research supplies and consulting fees, which we deploy across multiple R&D programs.
R&D expenses decreased $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in expenses for our manufacturing activities and our clinical trials of aldafermin, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related expenses, including an increase in share-based compensation expense of $5.8 million, and an increase in external expenses driven by our ongoing clinical trials of NGM621, NGM120 and NGM707 and our preclinical studies of NGM438 and NGM831.
R&D expenses increased $34.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a $31.0 million increase in external expenses driven by our manufacturing activities and ongoing clinical trials of aldafermin, NGM621, NGM120 and a product candidate for which development has since been suspended. The increase in R&D expenses in 2020 also included an increase of $5.6 million in personnel-related expenses and costs associated with preclinical IND-enabling studies for NGM707, NGM831 and NGM438. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in clinical trial materials and $1.4 million in unallocated R&D expenses related to multiple R&D programs.
We expect our R&D expenses will increase in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to our increased investment in our wholly-owned oncology programs. In 2022, we have substantial activities ongoing in all of our programs, and are targeting achievement of multiple milestones, including:
•NGM621: continuing treatment of patients in the fully enrolled Phase 2 CATALINA clinical trial, preparing to report topline data from that trial in the fourth quarter of 2022 and preparing for a potential Phase 3 trial;
•NGM707: continuing enrollment in the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial and preparing for a readout of initial data from the Phase 1a cohort in the second half of 2022;
•NGM120: continuing enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 PINNACLES clinical trial and preparing to report additional data from the Phase 1a and Phase 1b cohorts of the PINNACLES trial in the second half of 2022;
•NGM831: conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2022;
•NGM438: conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2022; and
•Aldafermin: continuing treatment of patients in the fully enrolled Phase 2b ALPINE 4 clinical trial and preparing to report topline data from that trial in the first half of 2023.
General and Administrative Expenses
G&A expenses increased $9.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount, an increase in share-based compensation expense of $4.7 million and a $2.5 million increase in fees paid to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. G&A expenses increased $3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount.
We anticipate that our G&A expenses in 2022 will increase compared to 2021 due to an increase in compensation-related expenses driven by higher headcount and other expenses related to the expansion and support of our business, in particular as needed to support our continued and increasing R&D activities, and to a lesser extent due to expenses associated with being a public company and with negotiating and entering into agreements with collaboration partners.
Interest Income, net
Interest income, net decreased $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in unrealized losses in marketable securities offset by an increase in interest income due to an increase in our average cash balance. Interest income, net decreased $4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to the decrease in market interest rates and a reduction in our cash balance.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Funding Requirements
We have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we are not and may never be profitable. We have incurred losses in each year since commencing operations, and we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses in 2022 and over the next several years. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $419.0 million, and we expect our accumulated deficit will increase significantly over time.
We have an active discovery research group and multiple pipeline programs in development. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund R&D of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates for the foreseeable future as our research, development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical trial and related activities increase.
Prior to 2022, we received substantial R&D funding from our collaboration with Merck. However, under the narrower scope of the Amended Collaboration Agreement, beginning in 2022, R&D funding from Merck will be substantially lower on an annual and overall basis, than the R&D funding previously provided by Merck and, beginning in April 2022, we cannot use R&D funding from Merck to support the development of any of our wholly-owned oncology programs, including NGM707, NGM831, NGM438 and NGM120. As a result, we need to fund not only our currently wholly-owned programs going forward, but also certain activities that remain within the scope of the ongoing collaboration with Merck that we are required to fund ourselves (and our failure to allocate funding to meet such requirements may be deemed a breach of the Amended Collaboration Agreement). In addition, we will need to fund any programs that are within the scope of the current collaboration with Merck in the event Merck does not elect to license these programs and we decide to continue to develop them, in the event Merck elects to terminate its license to any program it licenses and we decide to continue to develop it or in the event we opt to co-develop any program Merck elects to license, which could include NGM621.
Our cash requirements for fiscal year 2022 are expected to consist primarily of our R&D and G&A expenses. In 2021 and 2020, our R&D expenses were $161.7 million and $164.0 million, respectively. In 2022 and over the next several years, we expect our R&D expenses to increase substantially unless we partner one or more of our wholly-owned programs, particularly as we advance our oncology product candidates into and through clinical
development and support our later-stage clinical development of NGM621. In 2021 and 2020, our G&A expenses were $36.9 million and $27.2 million, respectively. Beginning in 2022 and over the next several years, we expect our G&A expenses to increase moderately as we continue to hire additional personnel to support our growing R&D activities and as we continue to incur the increased costs associated with being a public company.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Nonetheless, in order to advance our current and potential future product candidates through development and to regulatory approval and commercialization, we will need to raise significant additional capital or we will need to partner one or more of our wholly-owned programs and obtain funding or other resources through such arrangements. Neither may be possible and, as a result, we may be required to delay, scale back or discontinue development of such product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.
Sources of Liquidity
Cash and Investments
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $151.8 million and short-term marketable securities of $214.5 million. In January 2021, we sold 5,324,074 shares of our common stock upon completion of the follow-on offering for aggregate net proceeds of $134.6 million.
Merck Collaboration
The revenue we receive under the Amended Collaboration Agreement with Merck is currently our only source of revenue. For the period starting on April 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, Merck is committed to fund up to $20.0 million of R&D funding for the ophthalmology programs (other than NGM621), the CVM-related programs and the Lab Programs. Merck is also obligated to fund certain R&D costs related to NGM621 in an amount expected to be up to approximately $20.0 million, until the earlier of Merck's decision to exercise, or not to exercise, its license option with respect to NGM621 alone or bundled with the other continuing ophthalmology compounds or, March 31, 2024. See “Overview - Our Merck Collaboration” above.
Other Sources of Capital
In June 2020, we entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies. In accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million from time to time through Jefferies, acting as our sales agent. As of December 31, 2021, $127.2 million of our common stock remained available to be sold under the Sales Agreement, subject to conditions specified in the Sales Agreement.
We plan to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, including under the Sales Agreement, product collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or a combination of these potential financing sources. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts, on reasonable terms or when we need it, if at all.
Our ability to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings may be adversely impacted by worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, and in the biotechnology industry specifically, resulting from, among other things, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Furthermore, any securities that we may issue may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants or protective rights that would lead to restrictions on our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
We may seek other third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of any product candidates that are not within the scope of the collaboration with Merck. If we decide to enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, and are successful in doing so, we will likely have limited control over the
amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from any such arrangement will depend on the specific terms we reach with any collaborator, as well as each of our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in such arrangement towards developing, seeking regulatory approval for and commercializing our product candidates.
If we are unable to raise adequate additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings, collaborations or otherwise, on acceptable terms or at all, we may be delayed in or prevented from pursuing our planned and any future development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.
Cash Flow Activity
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities in 2021 was $73.2 million, which consisted of a net loss of $120.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $42.9 million and a change in operating assets and liabilities of $4.2 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $26.2 million, depreciation expense of $6.1 million, a decrease in related party contract assets due to the Amended Collaboration Agreement with Merck of $4.6 million, amortization of a premium on marketable securities of $3.5 million and noncash lease expense of $1.8 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by increases in contract liabilities of $17.8 million, related party receivable of $4.6 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.1 million and accrued liabilities of $2.9 million, partially offset by decreases in operating lease liabilities of $4.8 million, accounts payable of $4.4 million and related party contract assets of $1.5 million.
Cash used in operating activities in 2020 was $83.5 million, which consisted of a net loss of $102.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $22.3 million and net cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $3.3 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $15.7 million and depreciation expense of $6.6 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by increases in accrued expenses of $6.2 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.9 million, accounts payable of $0.9 million and a related party contract asset of $6.1 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in deferred rent of $2.8 million.
Cash used in operating activities in 2019 was $41.2 million, which consisted of a net loss of $42.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $19.6 million and net cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $17.9 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $12.9 million and depreciation expense of $7.6 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by increases in the related party receivable of $1.5 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.0 million, accounts payable of $3.6 million and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $8.9 million. These increases were offset by decreases in deferred rent of $2.7 million and contract liabilities of $24.2 million, which was primarily due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), referred to as ASC 606, and the timing of advance payments from Merck related to the reimbursement of costs associated with R&D activities.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities in 2021 was $71.7 million, which consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $293.5 million primarily from the net proceeds of the follow-on offering, partially offset by $223.5 million
in net proceeds on maturity of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities in 2020 was $51.0 million, which consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $177.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $1.9 million partially offset by net proceeds on maturity of marketable securities of $128.5 million. Cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $48.7 million, which consisted of net proceeds on maturity of marketable securities of $186.5 million partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $134.3 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.5 million.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was $149.7 million, which consisted of net proceeds from the follow-on offering of $134.6 million and proceeds from employee equity incentive and purchase plans of $14.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $35.5 million and primarily related to net proceeds from the Sales Agreement of $21.9 million and proceeds from employee equity incentive and purchase plans of $14.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was $180.8 million and primarily related to net proceeds from our IPO of $110.0 million, proceeds from a concurrent private placement with Merck of $65.9 million and proceeds from employee equity incentive and purchase plans of $4.8 million.
Contractual Obligations
We have contractual obligations related to our lease liabilities. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our lease commitments.
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes that are generally cancelable at any time by us, upon prior written notice, and may or may not include cancellation fees. Given that the amount and timing related to such payments are uncertain, they are not considered to be contractual obligations. Significant portions of our R&D resources are focused, and will continue to be focused, on the manufacture and testing of clinical trial materials. We expect our R&D expenses to increase substantially beginning in 2022 and over the next several years unless we partner one or more of our wholly-owned programs, particularly as we advance our oncology product candidates into and through clinical development and support our later-stage clinical development of NGM621. See "Funding Requirements" above for additional information regarding our expected R&D spend.
We are obligated to make future payments to third parties under in-license agreements, including sublicense fees, low single-digit royalties and payments that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones. As the amount and timing of sublicense fees and the achievement and timing of these milestones are not probable and estimable, such commitments have not been included on our consolidated balance sheets and are not considered to be contractual obligations. See "Business - Licensing Arrangements" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our current in-license agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most important policies in understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations because they are complex and relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgment.
Revenue Recognition
ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model outlined in ASC 606 to adhere to this core principle: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
All of our revenue to date has been generated from collaboration agreements, primarily the collaboration agreement with Merck. The terms of these agreements generally require us to provide (i) license options for our compounds, (ii) R&D services and (iii) non-mandatory services in connection with participation in research or steering committees. Payments received under these arrangements may include non-refundable upfront license fees, partial or complete reimbursement of R&D costs, contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of defined collaboration objectives and royalties on sales of commercialized products.
We assess whether the promises in our arrangements, including any options provided to the partner, are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. Judgment is required to determine whether the license to a compound is distinct from R&D services or participation in research and steering committees, as well as whether options create material rights in the contract. In situations when a contract includes distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct services.
The transaction price in each arrangement is generally comprised of a non-refundable upfront fee and unconstrained variable consideration related to the performance of R&D services. The unconstrained variable consideration amount included in the transaction price represents an amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We typically submit a budget for the R&D services to our partner in advance of performing the services. The transaction price is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when a license or service is not sold separately, the SSP is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We utilize judgment to assess the nature of our performance obligations to determine whether they are satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress toward completion. We re-evaluate estimated costs to satisfy a performance obligation each reporting period and make adjustments for any significant changes. In applying the cost-based input method, we measure actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs to fulfill our performance obligation. These budgeted costs consist of our employee full-time equivalent hours plus allowable external (third-party) costs incurred. Management applies considerable judgment in estimating expected costs as such costs are key inputs when applying the cost-based input method. We recognize revenue based on actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs as we complete a performance obligation applied to the transaction price. A significant change in the estimate of expected costs for the remainder of a contract term could have a material impact on revenue recognized (including the possible reversal of previously recognized revenue) at each reporting period, as well as a related impact on contract assets and liabilities.
Our collaboration agreements may include contingent payments related to specified development and regulatory milestones or contingent payments for royalties based on sales of a commercialized product. Milestones can be achieved for such activities in connection with progress in clinical trials, regulatory filings in various geographical markets and marketing approvals from health authorities. Sales-based royalties are generally related to the volume of annual sales of a commercialized product. At the inception of each agreement that includes such payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price by using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our or our partner’s control, such as those related to regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of each such milestone and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 606, sales-based royalties are not included in the transaction price. Instead, royalties are recognized at the later of when the performance obligation is satisfied or partially satisfied, or when the sale that gives rise to the royalty occurs.
Contract modifications, defined as changes in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that are approved by the parties to the contract, such as a contract amendment, exist when the parties to a contract approve a
modification that either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. Depending on facts and circumstances, we account for a contract modification as one of the following: (i) a separate contract; (ii) a termination of the existing contract and a creation of a new contract; or (iii) a combination of the preceding treatments. A contract modification is accounted for as a separate contract if the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised services that are distinct and if the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects our standalone selling prices of the additional promised services. When a contract modification is not considered a separate contract and the remaining services are distinct from the services transferred on or before the date of the contract modification, we account for the contract modification as a termination of the existing contract and a creation of a new contract. When a contract modification is not considered a separate contract and the remaining services are not distinct, we account for the contract modification as an add-on to the existing contract and as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing these consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses, the largest of which are R&D expenses. This process involves:
•identifying services that have been performed on our behalf by third-party vendors and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost;
•estimating and accruing expenses in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at the time; and
•periodically confirming the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and making adjustments, if necessary.
Examples of estimated R&D expenses that we accrue include:
•fees paid to CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;
•fees paid to CMOs in connection with the production of clinical trial materials and to procure raw materials and components for manufacture; and
•professional service fees for consulting and other services.
We base our expense accruals related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones. Our service providers generally invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
All of our clinical trials have been executed with support from CROs and other vendors. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by CROs based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial. For clinical trial expenses, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled, the activities to be performed for each patient, the number of active clinical sites and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the trial. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, correspondence with CROs and review of contractual terms. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of accrued R&D expenses after a reporting period. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which expanded the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions with nonemployees.
Stock-based compensation expense represents the grant-date fair value of stock options granted under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2008 Plan, and our 2018 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, or 2018 Plan, and rights to acquire stock granted under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures.
We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including stock price volatility, the expected term that stock options will remain outstanding, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.
The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the stock of similar entities within our industry over periods commensurate with our expected term assumption. The expected term of stock option grants represents the weighted-average period the options are expected to remain outstanding and is based on the “simplified” method where the expected term is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term for each option. We base the risk-free interest rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected option term. In reference to the expected dividend yield assumption, we have not historically paid, and do not expect for the foreseeable future to pay, a dividend.
