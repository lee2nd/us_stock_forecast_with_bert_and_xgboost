ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the section titled “Selected Financial Data” and our audited financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Results of operations for 2021 and 2020 reflect the impact of the Company's implementation of its long-term strategic plan beginning in late 2020 as it transitions to a SaaS-first business model. This transition prioritizes the use of resources for initiatives that grow recurring cloud revenue through the acquisition of new customers from an increasingly broad target market, vertical expansion within Qumu's customer base, and conversion of existing customers from the Company's on-premise solution to its SaaS solution. Such prioritization is reflected in higher costs incurred during 2021 and 2020 for sales and marketing initiatives intended to build sales pipeline by creating engaging content, building brand visibility, securing top rankings with industry influencers and analysts, investing in top management and sales talent globally, and onboarding new channel partners with resources, training and ongoing support for immediate penetration into their client bases.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company generated revenues of $24.0 million, $29.1 million and $25.4 million, respectively.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions. Management bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and warrant liability have the greatest potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements; therefore, management considers these to be critical accounting estimates. A critical accounting estimate is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, these are the estimates management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For information on the Company’s significant accounting policies, see Note 1-"Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company enters into sales contracts that can include various combinations of software licenses, appliances, maintenance and services, some of which are distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation, on a relative basis using its standalone selling price.
The Company determines the standalone selling price (SSP) for software-related elements, including professional services and software maintenance and support contracts, based on the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately. The Company estimates SSP by maximizing use of observable prices such as the prices charged to customers on a standalone basis, established prices lists, contractually stated prices, profit margins and other entity-specific factors, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling prices of its software licenses and cloud-hosted SaaS arrangements are highly variable. Thus, the Company estimates SSP for software licenses and cloud-hosted SaaS arrangements using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other goods and services promised in the contract.
Warrant Liability
The Company accounts for its warrants, which are derivative financial instruments, as a current liability based upon the characteristics and provisions of the instruments. The warrants were determined to be ineligible for equity classification because of provisions that allow the holder under certain circumstances, essentially the sale of the Company as defined in the warrant agreements, to receive cash payment or other consideration at the option of the holder in lieu of the Company’s common shares.
A warrant liability is recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at its fair value on the date of issuance and is revalued on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instrument is exercised or expires, with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as other income or expense. The Company estimates the fair value of this liability using option pricing models that are based on the individual characteristics of the warrants on the valuation date, which include the Company’s stock price and assumptions for expected volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate, as well as the present value of the minimum cash payment component of the instrument for the warrants, when applicable. Changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the resulting fair value of each warrant. The primary inputs affecting the value of the warrant liability are the Company’s stock price and volatility in the Company’s stock price, as well as assumptions about the probability and timing of certain events, such as a change in control or future equity offerings. Increases in the fair value of the underlying stock or increases in the volatility of the stock price generally result in a corresponding increase in the fair value of the warrant liability; conversely, decreases in the fair value of the underlying stock or decreases in the volatility of the stock price generally result in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability.
Reclassification of Recurring Term Software License Revenue
During 2021, the Company reclassified revenue recognized for recurring term software license agreements from service revenue to software licenses and appliances revenue, similar to perpetual software licenses. These recurring term software licenses have significant standalone functionality and, subsequent to delivery of the software, Qumu’s activities do not substantively change the functionality and do not significantly affect the use of the software delivered. Amounts and percentages following the reclassification for the prior years are as follows:
Results of Operations
The percentage relationships to revenues of certain income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and the percentage changes in these income and expense items between years, are contained in the following table:
Revenues
The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Software sales may take the form of a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS), recurring term software license or perpetual software license. Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses, recurring term software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes SaaS subscriptions, maintenance and support, and professional and other services.
The table below describes Qumu’s revenues by product category (dollars in thousands):
Revenues can vary year to year based on the type of contract the Company enters into with each customer. The $5.1 million, or 17%, decrease in total revenues from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by the Company’s accelerated shift to a SaaS-first revenue model initiated in late 2020, the expected end of certain on-premise customer relationships and a large on-premises customer order in 2020. This resulted in a decrease of $6.4 million in software and appliance revenue, which primarily consisted of on-premise software and related hardware in 2020 and primarily consisted of recurring term software revenue in 2021. The $1.3 million increase in service revenues from 2020 to 2021 resulted from an increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues due to on-premise to cloud conversions, incremental cloud customer expansion, new customers, and recurring revenue attributable to SaaS sales orders in recent quarters.
The $3.7 million, or 15%, increase in total revenues from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by revenue attributable to a large customer order received at the end of the first quarter 2020, resulting in increases in both software licenses and appliances revenues and service revenues, partially offset by the recognition of large term license sales in 2019 that were absent in the comparable 2020 period. Also contributing to the increase in service revenues was a $545,000, or 25%, increase in professional services revenues, which benefited from large software and appliances sales during 2020.
Future consolidated revenues will be dependent upon many factors, including the rate of adoption of the Company’s software solutions in its targeted markets and whether arrangements with customers are structured as a perpetual, term or SaaS licenses,
which impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Other factors that will influence future consolidated revenues include the timing of customer orders and renewals, the product and service mix of customer orders, the impact of changes in economic conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
A comparison of gross profit and gross margin by revenue category is as follows (dollars in thousands):
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, gross margins are inclusive of the impact of approximately $106,000, $286,000 and $455,000, respectively, in amortization expense associated with intangible assets. The Company had 22, 21 and 19 service personnel at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Total gross margin percentage increased 3.0% in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily driven by a larger mix of higher margin services revenue, and an increase of 14.8% in software license and appliances gross margin, attributed to a higher mix of high margin recurring term license software revenue.
Total gross margin percentage decreased 0.9% in 2020, as compared to 2019, as software license and appliances gross margin decreased 5.5%, impacted in 2020 by a lower mix of term license revenue, which generally carries higher margins, compared to 2019.
Future gross profit margins will fluctuate quarter to quarter and will be impacted by the Company’s continued expansion into new market opportunities as well as the rate of growth and mix of the Company’s product and service offerings and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Operating Expenses
The following is a summary of operating expenses (dollars in thousands):
Operating expenses represented 151%, 96%, and 93% of revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating expenses for 2021 increased from 2020 by $8.1 million, or 29%, primarily driven by increased costs for outside services and consulting associated with the continued implementation of the Company’s strategic plan in 2021 and higher compensation costs associated with an increased number of personnel, offset by the inclusion in the prior year of $1.6 million of transaction-related expenses related to the Company’s merger agreement and subsequent merger termination with Synacor, Inc. totaling $1.6 million in 2020. In the third quarter 2021, the Company initiated a cost-optimization program to align expenses with anticipated revenue, which included initiatives designed to reduce the Company’s cash burn rate, slow hiring and implement other cost-control measures. As part of this program, the Company incurred severance expense within operating expenses of $451,000 for 2021; the Company incurred severance expense of $647,000 and $152,000 for 2020 and 2019, respectively, relating to other cost reduction initiatives and personnel transitions and, in 2020, the departure of the Company’s chief executive officer.
Operating expenses for 2020 increased from 2019 by $4.4 million, primarily driven by approximately $1.6 million in one-time transaction expense associated with the Company’s now terminated merger with Synacor, Inc. and approximately $917,000 in one-time non-cash office lease charges resulting from adoption of the Company’s remote work policy in the fourth quarter 2020.
The Company had 86, 81 and 86 personnel in operating activities at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Research and development
Research and development expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 represented 35%, 28% and 29% of revenues, respectively. The Company had 28, 36 and 36 research and development personnel at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The $174,000 increase in total expenses in 2021, compared to 2020, was due to an increase in overhead and other expenses, primarily relating to cloud hosting expenses to support Qumu’s development initiatives and customers’ usage of Qumu’s cloud-based enterprise video solution, and an increase in outside services and consulting expenses resulting from higher third party development and support costs; these increases were partially offset by lower compensation and other employee-related expenses resulting from a decrease in research and development personnel. The $892,000 increase in total expenses in 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily due to increased costs related to the mix of research and development personnel, incentive compensation costs and projects to support customers’ increased usage of Qumu’s cloud-based enterprise video solution due to COVID-19.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Total sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 represented 77%, 31% and 34% of revenues, respectively. The Company had 43, 28 and 32 sales and marketing personnel at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The $9.4 million increase in total sales and marketing expense in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher compensation and employee-related expenses associated with the hiring of sales and marketing personnel as management aggressively recruited personnel to expand and augment Qumu’s existing resources with experienced SaaS sales and marketing professionals. Additionally, outside services and consulting expenses increased due to the continued execution of the Company’s strategic plan in 2021, which included costs Qumu incurred honing its updated sales enablement and messaging, launching new products and expanding its go-to-market motions, with the majority of such costs occurring in the first half of 2021. Cost-optimization measures initiated in the third quarter 2021 resulted in lower sales and marketing expense during the second half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2021. Management plans to further reduce sales and marketing expenses to
align resources with Qumu's strategic plan in 2022. The $346,000 increase in total sales and marketing expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased costs for outside services and consulting associated with the implementation of the Company’s strategic plan in 2020, higher compensation costs associated with changes in sales and marketing personnel, and increased commissions expense, partially offset by cost savings resulting from sales activities and customer marketing events that were conducted virtually rather than in person. Sales and marketing expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 included severance expense of $301,000, $145,000 and $152,000, respectively, relating to cost reduction initiatives and personnel transitions.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
n/m = not meaningful
Total general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 represented 36%, 35% and 27% of revenues, respectively. The Company had 15, 17 and 18 general and administrative personnel at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The $1.5 million decrease in total expenses in 2021 as compared to 2020 was driven primarily by inclusion in the prior year of $1.6 million of transaction-related expenses related to the Company’s merger agreement and subsequent merger termination with Synacor, Inc., $917,000 in non-cash charges resulting from the adoption of the Company’s remote work policy in the fourth quarter 2020, and $0.4 million of severance costs incurred with the departure of the Company’s chief executive officer in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by increases in outside services and consulting expenses and overhead and other expenses due to higher utilization of consultants and improvements to information systems in connection with the execution with Qumu’s long-term strategic plan during 2021. The $3.3 million increase in total expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven primarily by the transaction-related expenses, non-cash office lease surrender costs and executive severance costs noted above.
Amortization of Purchased Intangibles
Operating expenses include $649,000, $657,000 and $757,000 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in October 2011 and Kulu Valley in October 2014. Operating expenses in 2022 are expected to include approximately $0.6 million of amortization expense associated with purchased intangibles.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was as follows (dollars in thousands):
n/m = not meaningful
Interest expense, net
The Company recognized interest expense, net, of $100,000, $73,000 and $754,000 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily related to its note payable, term loans and finance leases, including the amortization of deferred financing costs. The decrease in interest expense in 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in term loan debt resulting from the Company’s $4.0 million remaining principal balance payment on November 12, 2019.
Change in fair values of derivative liability and warrant liability
In conjunction with debt financings completed in October 2016 and January 2018, the Company issued two transferable warrants for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,239,286 shares of the Company’s common stock, of which one representing 238,583 shares remained partially unexercised and outstanding at December 31, 2021. On May 1, 2020, the Company canceled a warrant in exchange for a note payable (see Note 5-"Fair Value Measurements" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) which contained an embedded derivative liability that is measured on a recurring basis at fair value. The Company recognized non-cash income of $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative liability. The derivative liability was derecognized on April 1, 2021 upon expiration of the contingent payment obligation without the contingency being triggered.
During 2021 the Company recorded non-cash income of $1.5 million and during 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded non-cash expense of $1.8 million and $141,000, respectively, resulting from the change in fair value of the warrant liability. See Note 4-"Commitments and Contingencies" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of inputs impacting changes in fair value. The non-cash expense of $1.8 million in 2020 primarily resulted from an increase in the Company’s stock price to $7.99 per share at December 31, 2020 from $2.61 per share at December 31, 2019. The non-cash income of $1.5 million in 2021 primarily resulted from a decrease in the Company’s stock price to $2.12 per share at December 31, 2021.
Gain on sale of BriefCam, Ltd.
During 2018, Canon Inc. acquired all of the outstanding shares of BriefCam, Ltd. ("BriefCam"), a privately-held Israeli company in which Qumu held convertible preferred shares. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, the Company recognized gains of $50,000 and $41,000, respectively, related to the release of cash from escrow in connection with the sale.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
On November 12, 2019, the Company paid the remaining $4.8 million on its outstanding term loan from ESW Holdings, Inc. under its term loan credit agreement dated January 12, 2018. The payment was comprised of principal of $4.0 million and accrued interest of $528,000 for the period July 19, 2018 to the payment date of November 12, 2019. The Company used a portion of the $8.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock on November 7, 2019 to fund the payment. The Company determined that the payment of principal constituted an extinguishment of debt and, as such, recognized a $348,000 loss related to the write down of $98,000 of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs and recognition of a $250,000 prepayment fee upon payment of the remaining term loan balance.
Other expense, net
Other expense, net, includes sublease income from the Company’s subleases of $105,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. No sublease income was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Other expense, net, also includes a net gain on foreign currency transactions of $2,000 in 2021 and net losses on foreign currency transactions of $406,000 and $260,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for a discussion of changes in cash levels.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes represents federal, state, and foreign income taxes or income tax benefit on income or loss. Net income tax benefit was $392,000, $306,000 and $194,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The net income tax benefit for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by the tax benefit for refundable research credits from the United Kingdom operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Company’s liquidity and capital resources (in thousands):
As of December 31, 2021, the Company's principal source of liquidity consisted of $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $11.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $5.0 million in outstanding principal amount of indebtedness to Wells Fargo under the Company’s revolving line of credit. Each reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to meet its future contractual obligations and other conditions and events that may impact its liquidity.
Going Concern Considerations
As of December 31, 2021, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and potential availability under our Wells Fargo line of credit that had a maturity of January 2023. Additionally, we have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities.
In February 2022, our board of directors adopted an operating plan designed to accelerate cash flow break even operations and continue to support the pivot from primarily a direct sales strategy to a targeted channel-led strategy. As part of the board approved operating plan, we implemented a cost optimization program that is in addition to the cash management actions we took in 2021.
Our capital needs are based upon management estimates as to future revenue and expense, which involves significant judgment. The success of the operating plan is dependent upon anticipated growth through Qumu's channel sales partners in the second half of 2022 and achieving and maintaining an expense structure that is aligned with our revenue and cash flows. The focus on driving sales through Qumu’s channel sales partners is a relatively new element of our sales strategy and management currently has limited sales pipeline visibility. Additionally, maintaining an aligned expense structure requires that we accurately forecast revenue and cash flow so that our management can take timely action to reduce expenses in proportion to and concurrently with any shortfalls in revenue and cash flow.
As part of our board-approved operating plan, on April 15, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “SVB Agreement”) with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a revolving line of credit having a maturity of April 2024. The maximum availability for borrowing under the SVB Agreement is the lesser of $7.5 million or the sum of a defined borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus a non-formula amount of $2.5 million. The non-formula amount will be eliminated from availability under the line of credit at the earlier of April 30, 2023 or the date on which our net cash, as defined, is less
than $5.0 million. No amounts are outstanding under the SVB Agreement as of April 15, 2022. The SVB Agreement requires us to maintain an adjusted quick ratio greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00. The adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of (a) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in SVB deposit accounts or securities accounts plus net billed accounts receivable and (b) the sum of current liabilities less the current portion of deferred revenue. Our monthly operations and resulting adjusted quick ratio are subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and negative operating results may cause non-compliance with the adjusted quick ratio.
Based on management's sensitivity analysis of liquidity requirements, should the execution of its plans generate the financial results consistent with the February 2022 board-approved operating plan, the Company expects it will be able to maintain current operations and meet anticipated capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months through any cash flows generated from current operations, cash reserves, and additional resources, including the availability of borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility pursuant to the SVB Agreement.
However, if Qumu’s revenue growth is significantly lower than anticipated and Qumu does not actively manage expenses and cash consumption in advance of these significant revenue shortfalls, Qumu will need additional capital to fund its business plan and under those circumstances, borrowing under our line of credit with SVB may be limited due to borrowing base availability or covenant non-compliance. Our cash resources and the limitations under the SVB Agreement on our available borrowing present the risk that we will not have sufficient cash available in the amount or at the time we need it to fund our ongoing operations and execute our business plan over the next twelve months.
Accordingly, our history of losses and our cash resources available to execute our business plan over the next twelve months raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans to address the doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern include positioning the targeted channel-led strategy for success through efforts to expand the number of high quality channel partners, educating channel partners on the Company’s platform, tools and differentiated features, and providing performance-based incentives to channel partners to accelerate customer deals, as well as continuous assessment of the sales pipeline to forecast SaaS revenue growth driven by new customer and expansion bookings sourced through the channel. Additionally, management will actively monitor eligible accounts for the purposes of the SVB Agreement borrowing base calculation and monitor doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, which have historically been minimal. To the extent that increasing traction in the channel-led strategy is not realized, management would continue to manage its cost optimization program to further align expenditures with the timing and amount of cash receipts from new sales and renewals of existing sales contracts. These cost optimization measures may include reductions in the Company's personnel, reduced utilization of contractors, and decreases in other discretionary spend.
The Company may also increase its cash resources by drawing on the SVB line of credit to the extent of any availability. To the extent we require additional capital, we may seek capital by refinancing our existing line of credit or from offering of our equity securities or both. If the Company experiences a significant shortfall in performance as compared to plan and also is unable to secure additional capital in a sufficient amount or on acceptable terms, management may be required to implement more significant cost reduction and other cash-focused measures to manage liquidity and the Company may have to significantly delay, scale back, or cease operations, in part or in full.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of its assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
As of December 31, 2021, the Company's principal source of liquidity consisted of $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $11.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $5.0 million in outstanding principal amount of indebtedness to Wells Fargo under the Company’s revolving line of credit, which was subsequently repaid in full on April 12, 2022.
The Company's primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during 2021 were proceeds from the issuance of common stock, cash generated from operations, and proceeds from the Company’s line of credit with Wells Fargo that was replaced on April 15, 2022 by a line of credit from Silicon Valley Bank. The Company’s cash generated from operations has been cash collections from sales of products and services to customers. The Company expects cash inflows from operations to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections.
The Company’s primary use of cash has been for personnel costs and outside service providers, other operating expenses, debt extinguishment, payment of royalties associated with third-party software licenses and purchases of equipment to fulfill customer orders. The Company expects its use of cash to be affected by fluctuations in revenues, personnel costs and outside service providers as the Company continues to support the growth of the business, which is expected to be impacted in the future by the Company’s cost-optimization program initiated in the third quarter 2021. The Company additionally expects to use cash to renew internal-use software subscriptions of approximately $682,000 in 2022 as well as to remit in the fourth quarter of 2022 approximately $160,000 of payroll tax withholdings deferred under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act").
The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s international subsidiaries that is available to fund domestic operations upon repatriation was $1.3 million as of December 31, 2021. The repatriation of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's international subsidiaries would not result in an adverse tax impact on cash given that the future tax consequences of repatriation are expected to be insignificant.
Working Capital
At December 31, 2021, the Company had aggregate working capital of $5.2 million, compared to negative working capital of $2.9 million at December 31, 2020. Working capital includes current deferred revenue of $10.9 million and $12.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in working capital as of December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, was primarily due to $23.1 million net proceeds from the public offering in the first quarter 2021, a $5.0 million draw on the Company’s line of credit in the fourth quarter 2021 and cash receipts from customers, offset by disbursements made to vendors.
Other
In the fourth quarter 2021, the Company drew $5.0 million on its Wells Fargo line of credit entered into on January 15, 2021. Financing obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily consisted of financed insurance premiums and finance leases related to the acquisition of computer and network equipment. Operating lease liabilities consists of liabilities related to the Company’s office leases. The note payable to ESW Holdings, Inc., which was non-interest bearing having a face amount of $1.83 million and maturing on April 1, 2021, was repaid upon the Company’s closing of the Wells Fargo revolving credit facility in January 2021. This initial draw on the Wells Fargo line of credit was repaid within the first quarter 2021. The Wells Fargo line of credit was paid in full on April 12, 2022 in anticipation of the line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank entered into on April 15, 2022.
Summary of Cash Flows. A summary of cash flows is as follows (in thousands):
Operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $17.4 million for 2021 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 million in 2020. The cash used in operations resulted primarily from costs the Company incurred in connection with the implementation of its long-term strategic plan beginning in late 2020 as it transitions to a SaaS-first business model. Impacting cash used in operations in 2021 was a net loss of $16.4 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $4.0 million. The operating cash flows for the 2020 were favorably impacted by the change in deferred revenue, offset by the net loss for 2020.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources
Wells Fargo Credit Facility
On January 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Wells Fargo line of credit”), providing for a revolving line of credit. Pursuant to the Wells Fargo line of credit, the Company granted a security interest in substantially all of its properties, right and assets (including certain equity interest of the Company’s subsidiaries). As of December 31, 2021, the Company maintained an outstanding principal balance on the revolving line of $5.0 million and was in compliance with its covenants. The Wells Fargo line of credit had a maturity date of January 15, 2023. The Wells Fargo line of credit was repaid in full and terminated on April 12, 2022.
Silicon Valley Bank Credit Facility
On April 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “SVB Agreement”) with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a $7.5 million revolving line of credit. The maximum availability for borrowing under the SVB Agreement is the lesser of $7.5 million or the sum of a defined borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus a non-formula amount of $2.5 million. The non-formula amount will be eliminated from availability under the line of credit at the earlier of April 30, 2023 or the date on which our net cash, as defined, is less than $5.0 million. The maturity of the SVB Agreement is April 15, 2024. No amounts are outstanding under the SVB Agreement as of April 15, 2022.
Any borrowings under the SVB Agreement bear interest based on an interest rate dependent on Net Cash of above or below $5.0 million. Net Cash is defined as (a) the Company's cash maintained with Silicon Valley Bank less (b) the outstanding line of credit balance. If Net Cash is greater than $5.0 million, then the interest rate is the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal ("WSJ") for the relevant period plus 1.50%. If cash liquidity is less than $5.0 million, then the interest rate is the WSJ prime rate plus 2.00%. The SVB Agreement contains certain reporting requirements, conditions, and covenants, including a covenant requiring the Company to maintain an adjusted quick ratio greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00. The adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of (a) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in SVB deposit accounts or securities accounts plus net billed accounts receivable and (b) the sum of current liabilities less the current portion of deferred revenue.
