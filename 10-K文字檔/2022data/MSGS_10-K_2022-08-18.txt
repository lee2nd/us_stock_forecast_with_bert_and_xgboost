MSGE Distribution
On April 17, 2020 (the “MSGE Distribution Date”), the Company distributed all of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment to its stockholders (the “MSGE Distribution”). MSG Entertainment owns, directly or indirectly, the entertainment business previously owned and operated by the Company through its MSG Entertainment business segment and the sports booking business previously owned and operated by the Company through its MSG Sports business segment. In the MSGE Distribution, (a) each holder of the Company’s Class A common stock, received one share of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company’s Class A common stock held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on April 13, 2020 (the “Record Date”), and (b) each holder of the Company’s Class B common stock, received one share of MSG Entertainment Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company’s Class B common stock held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on the Record Date. Subsequent to the MSGE Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of MSG Entertainment for purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of MSG Entertainment have been reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSGE Distribution Date.
After giving effect to the MSGE Distribution, the Company operates and reports financial information in one segment.

Business Overview
The Company owns and operates a portfolio of assets featuring some of the most recognized teams in all of sports, including the Knicks of the NBA and the Rangers of the NHL. Both the Knicks and the Rangers play their home games at The Garden. The Company’s other professional sports franchises include two development league teams - the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League and the Westchester Knicks of the NBA G League. Our professional sports franchises are collectively referred to herein as “our sports teams.” In addition, the Company owns Knicks Gaming, an esports franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League, as well as a controlling interest in Counter Logic Gaming (“CLG”), a North American esports organization. The Company also operates two professional sports team performance centers - the Madison Square Garden Training Center in Greenburgh, NY and the CLG Performance Center in Los Angeles, CA. CLG and Knicks Gaming are collectively referred to herein as “our esports teams,” and together with the sports teams, the “teams.”
Revenue Sources
We earn revenue from several primary sources: ticket sales and a portion of suite rental fees at The Garden, our share of distributions from NHL and NBA league-wide national and international television contracts and other league-wide revenue sources, venue signage and other sponsorships, food and beverage sales at The Garden and merchandising. We also earn substantial fees from MSG Networks for the local media rights to telecast the games of our sports teams. The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our sports teams and general economic and health and safety conditions. In particular, when our sports teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our sports teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenue derives from media rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our sports teams. In addition, due to the NBA and NHL playing seasons, revenues from our business are typically concentrated in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year. The concentration of our revenues and expenses, however, was different in fiscal year 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ticket Sales and Facility and Ticketing Fees
Ticket sales have historically constituted our largest single source of revenue. Tickets to our sports teams’ home games are sold through season tickets (full and partial plans), which are typically held by long-term season subscribers, through group sales, and through single-game tickets, which are purchased by fans either individually or in multi-game packages. We generally review and set the price of our tickets before the start of each team’s season. However, we dynamically price our individual tickets based on opponent, seat location, day of the week and other factors. We do not earn revenue from ticket sales for games played by our teams at their opponents’ arenas.
We also earn revenues in the form of certain fees added to ticket prices, which currently include a facility fee the Company charges on tickets it sells to our sports teams’ games, except for season tickets.
Media Rights
We earn revenue from the licensing of media rights for our sports teams’ home and away games and also through the receipt of our share of fees paid for league-wide media rights, which are awarded under contracts negotiated and administered by each league.
The Company and MSG Networks are parties to media rights agreements covering the local telecast rights for the Knicks and the Rangers. The financial success of the Company is significantly dependent on the rights fees we receive from MSG Networks in connection with the telecast of our Knicks and Rangers games.
National and international telecast arrangements differ by league. Fees paid by telecasters under these arrangements are pooled by each league and then generally shared equally among all teams.
Suites and Clubs
We earn revenue through the sale of suite and premium club licenses at The Garden, which are generally sold by MSG Entertainment to corporate customers pursuant to multi-year licenses. Under standard licenses, the licensees pay an annual license fee, which varies depending on the location and type of the suite or club. The license fee includes, for each seat in the suite or club, tickets for our home games and other events at The Garden that are presented by MSG Entertainment for which tickets are sold to the general public, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, suite holders separately pay for food and beverage service in their suites at The Garden. Food and non-alcoholic beverage service is included in the annual license fee paid by club members.
Because suite and club licenses cover both our games and events that MSG Entertainment presents at The Garden, suite and club rental revenue is shared between us and MSG Entertainment under the arena license agreements (the “Arena License Agreements”) we entered into in connection with the MSGE Distribution. Pursuant to the Arena Licenses Agreements, the Knicks and the Rangers are entitled to 35% and 32.5%, respectively, of the revenues received by MSG Entertainment in connection with suite and club licenses.
Sponsorships and Signage
We earn revenues through the sale of sponsorships and signage specific to the teams. Sales of team specific signage generally involve the sale of advertising space within The Garden during our sports teams’ home games and include the sale of signage on the ice and on the boards of the hockey rink during Rangers games, courtside during Knicks games, and/or on the various scoreboards and display panels at The Garden, as well as virtual signage during Knicks and Rangers broadcasts. We offer both television camera-visible and non-camera-visible signage space. We also earn a portion of revenues through MSG Entertainment’s sale of venue indoor signage space and sponsorship rights at The Garden that are not specific to our teams pursuant to the Arena License Agreements.
Sponsorship rights generally require the use of the name, logos and other trademarks of a sponsor in the advertising and in promotions for The Garden in general or our teams specifically during our sports events. Sponsorship arrangements may be exclusive within a particular sponsorship category or non-exclusive and generally permit a sponsor to use the name, logos and other trademarks of our teams and, in the case of sponsorship arrangements shared with MSG Entertainment, MSG Entertainment’s venues and brands in connection with their own advertising and in promotions in The Garden or in the community.
Food, Beverage and Merchandise Sales
We earn revenues from the sale of food and beverages during our sports teams’ games at The Garden. In addition to concession-style sales of food and beverages, which represent the majority of food and beverage revenues, The Garden also provides higher-end dining at premium clubs as well as catering for suites. Pursuant to the Arena License Agreements, the Knicks and the Rangers receive 50% of net profits from the sales of food and beverages during their games at The Garden.
We also earn revenues from the sale of our sports teams’ merchandise both through the in-venue and online sale of items bearing the logos or other marks of our teams and through our share of sports league distributions of royalties and other revenues from the sports leagues’ licensing of team and sports league trademarks, which are generally shared equally among the teams in the sports leagues. Pursuant to the Arena License Agreements, the Knicks and the Rangers pay MSG Entertainment a commission equal to 30% of revenues from the sales of their merchandise at The Garden.
Other
Amounts collected for ticket sales, suite licenses and clubs, sponsorships and venue signage in advance of an event are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenues when earned.
Expenses
The most significant expenses are player and other team personnel salaries and charges for transactions relating to players for career-ending and season-ending injuries, trades, and waivers and contract termination costs of players and other team personnel, including team executives. We also incur costs for travel, player insurance, league operating assessments (including a 6% NBA assessment on regular season ticket sales), NBA and NHL revenue sharing and, when applicable, NBA luxury tax.
In addition, in connection with the MSGE Distribution we entered into long term leases with MSG Entertainment that end June 30, 2055 and allow the Knicks and the Rangers to play their home games at The Garden (the “Arena License Agreements”). The Arena License Agreements provide for fixed payments to be made from inception through June 30, 2055 in 12 equal installments during each year of the contractual term. The contracted license fee for the first full contract year ending June 30, 2021 was approximately $22,500 for the Knicks and approximately $16,700 for the Rangers, and then for each subsequent year, the license fees are 103% of the license fees for the immediately preceding contract year.
At the time of the MSGE Distribution, the Garden was not available for use due to the government-mandated suspension of events in response to COVID-19, and was only available at reduced capacity beginning in December 2020 through May 2021. As a result, the Company was not required to pay license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements until games resumed at The Garden, and the Company paid substantially reduced fees while attendance was limited. Effective July 1, 2021, the Company began paying license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements in their full contractual amounts.
Player Salaries, Escrow System/Revenue Sharing and NBA Luxury Tax
The amount we pay an individual player is typically determined by negotiation between the player (typically represented by an agent) and us, and is generally influenced by the player’s past performance, the amounts paid to players with comparable past performance by other sports teams, the NBA luxury tax and restrictions in the CBAs, including the salary floors and caps. The leagues’ CBAs typically contain restrictions on when players may move between league clubs following expiration of their contracts and what rights their current and former clubs have.
NBA CBA. The NBA CBA expires after the 2023-24 season (although each of the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association (“NBPA”) has the right (which must be exercised by December 15, 2022) to terminate the CBA effective following the 2022-23 season). The NBA CBA contains a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team’s aggregate player salaries with a requirement that the team pay any deficiency to the players on its roster) and a “soft” salary cap (i.e., a cap on each team’s aggregate player salaries but with certain exceptions that enable teams to pay players more, sometimes substantially more, than the cap).
NBA Luxury Tax. Amounts in this paragraph are in thousands, except for luxury tax rates. The NBA CBA generally provides for a luxury tax that is applicable to all teams with aggregate player salaries exceeding a threshold that is set prior to each season based upon projected league-wide revenues (as defined under the NBA CBA). The luxury tax rates for teams with aggregate player salaries above such threshold start at $1.50 for each $1.00 of team salary above the threshold up to $5,000 and scale up to $3.25 for each $1.00 of team salary that is from $15,000 to $20,000 over the threshold, and an additional tax rate increment of $0.50 applies for each additional $5,000 (or part thereof) of team salary in excess of $20,000 over the threshold. In addition, for teams that are taxpayers in at least three of four previous seasons, the above tax rates are increased by $1.00 for each increment. Fifty percent of the aggregate luxury tax payments is a funding source for the revenue sharing plan (described below) and the remaining 50% of such payments is distributed in equal shares to non-taxpaying teams. For the 2021-22 and 2020-21 seasons, the Knicks were not a luxury tax payer and we recorded approximately $10,457 and $3,442, respectively, of luxury tax proceeds from tax-paying teams. Tax obligations for years beyond the 2021-22 season will be subject to contractual player payroll obligations and corresponding NBA luxury tax thresholds. The Company recognizes the estimated amount associated with luxury tax expense or the amount it expects to receive as a non-tax paying team, if applicable, on a straight-line basis over the NBA regular season as a component of direct operating expenses.
NBA Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NBA CBA also provides that players collectively receive a designated percentage of league-wide revenues (net of certain direct expenses) as compensation (approximately 49% to 51%), and the teams retain the remainder. The percentage of league-wide revenues paid as compensation and retained by the teams does not apply evenly across all teams and, accordingly, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Knicks’ revenues than other NBA teams.
For the 2020-21 season and the remainder of the CBA, a new “Ten-and-Spread” system was put in place. Under the Ten-and-Spread system, based upon league-wide revenues, aggregate player compensation will be reduced by up to 10% of each player’s salary. If, for a particular season, compensation reductions in excess of 10% are needed, the excess will be divided by three and recouped via reductions to players’ compensation over the same season, and the subsequent two seasons. The reduction of players’ salary for any one season is capped at 20% and carried over to the subsequent season as additional compensation reductions. Each team is entitled to receive an equal one-thirtieth share of the compensation reductions up to 10% and the excess above 10% is allocated in proportion to each team’s player payroll.
The NBA also has a revenue sharing plan that generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds to teams with below-average net revenues (as defined in the plan), subject to reduction or elimination based on individual team market size and profitability. The plan is funded by a combination of disproportionate contributions from teams with above-average net revenues, subject to certain profit-based limits (each as defined in the plan); 50% of aggregate league-wide luxury tax proceeds (see above); and collective league sources, if necessary. Additional amounts may also be distributed on a discretionary basis, funded by assessments on playoff ticket revenues and through collective league sources and are recorded as revenues from league distributions.
We record our revenue sharing expense net of escrow. Our net provisions for these items for the year ended June 30, 2022 was approximately $34,186. The actual amounts for the 2021-22 season may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NBA teams for the season and other factors.
NHL CBA. The current NHL CBA expires after the 2025-26 season (with the possibility of a one year extension in certain circumstances). The NHL CBA provides for a salary floor (i.e., a floor on each team’s aggregate player salaries) and a “hard” salary cap (i.e., teams may not exceed a stated maximum, which is adjusted each season based upon league-wide revenues).
NHL Escrow System/Revenue Sharing. The NHL CBA provides that each season the players receive as player compensation 50% of that season’s league-wide revenues. Because the aggregate amount to be paid to the players is based upon league-wide revenues and not on a team-by-team basis, the Company may pay its players a higher or lower percentage of the Rangers’ revenues than other NHL teams pay of their own revenues. In order to implement the escrow system, NHL teams withhold a portion of each player’s salary and contribute the withheld amounts to an escrow account. If the league’s aggregate player compensation for a season exceeds the designated percentage (50%) of that season’s league-wide revenues, the excess is retained by the league. Any such excess funds are distributed to all teams in equal shares. In addition, the NHL CBA limits the amount of deductions to be withheld from player salaries each year. If annual escrow deductions from player salaries are insufficient to limit league-wide player salaries to 50% of that season’s league-wide revenues, any shortfall will be carried forward to future seasons and remain due from the players to the league.
The NHL CBA also provides for a revenue sharing plan. The plan generally requires the distribution of a pool of funds approximating 6.055% of league-wide revenues to certain qualifying lower-revenue teams and is funded as follows: (a) 50% from contributions by the top ten revenue earning teams (based on preseason and regular season revenues, net of arena costs) in accordance with a formula; (b) then from payments by teams participating in the playoffs, with each team contributing 35% of its gate receipts for each home playoff game (although this provision was waived for the 2020-21 season); and (c) the remainder from centrally-generated NHL sources. We record our revenue sharing expense net of the amount we expect to receive from escrow recoveries. Our net provisions for these items for the year ended June 30, 2022 was approximately $48,209. The actual amounts for the 2021-22 season may vary significantly from the recorded provision based on actual operating results for the league and all NHL teams for the season and other factors.
Other Team Operating Expenses
Our teams also pay expenses associated with day-to-day operations, including for travel, equipment maintenance and player insurance. Direct variable day-of-event costs incurred at The Garden, such as the costs of front-of-house and back-of-house staff, including electricians, laborers, box office staff, ushers, security, and event production are charged to the Company.
In addition, our team operating expenses include operating costs of the Company’s training center in Greenburgh, NY. The operation of the Hartford Wolf Pack is reported as a net Rangers player development expense.
As members of the NBA and NHL, the Knicks and the Rangers, respectively, are also subject to league assessments. The governing bodies of each league determine the amount of each season’s league assessments that are required from each member team. The NBA imposes on each team a 6% assessment on regular season ticket revenue.
We also incur costs associated with VIP amenities provided to certain ticket holders.
Other Expenses
Other expenses primarily include Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses that consist of administrative costs, including compensation, professional fees, and costs related to the Company’s services agreement with MSGE Entertainment, as well as sales and marketing costs, including fees related to the Company’s sponsorship sales and service representation agreements with MSG Entertainment and non-event related advertising expenses.
Factors Affecting Operating Results
General
Our operating results are largely dependent on the continued popularity and/or on-court or on-ice competitiveness of our Knicks and Rangers teams, which have a direct effect on ticket sales for the teams’ home games and are each team’s largest single source of revenue. As with other sports teams, the competitive positions of our sports teams depend primarily on our ability to develop, obtain and retain talented players, for which we compete with other professional sports teams. A significant factor in our ability to attract and retain talented players is player compensation. The Company’s operating results reflect the impact of high costs for player salaries (including NBA luxury tax, if any) and salaries of non-player team personnel. In addition, we have incurred significant charges for costs associated with transactions relating to players on our sports teams for season-ending and career-ending injuries and for trades, waivers and contract terminations of players and other team personnel, including team executives. Waiver and termination costs reflect our efforts to improve the competitiveness of our sports teams. These transactions can result in significant charges as the Company recognizes the estimated ultimate costs of these events in the period in which they occur, although amounts due to these individuals are generally paid over their remaining contract terms. For example, the expense for these items was $737, and $44,242 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses add to the volatility of our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to improve the overall quality of our
sports teams and our efforts may result in continued significant expenses and charges. Such expenses and charges may result in future operating losses although it is not possible to predict their timing or amount. Our performance has been, and may in the future be, impacted by work stoppages. See “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
In addition to our future performance being dependent upon the continued popularity and/or on-court or on-ice competitiveness of our Knicks and Rangers teams, it is also dependent on general economic conditions, in particular those in the New York City metropolitan area, and the effect of these conditions on our customers. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations as it may lead to lower demand for suite licenses and tickets to the games of our sports teams, which would also negatively affect merchandise and concession sales, as well as decrease levels of sponsorship and venue signage revenues. In addition, remote and/or hybrid in-office work arrangements in the New York City metropolitan area resulting from COVID-19 could result in reduced attendance at Knicks and Rangers games.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
During fiscal years 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 disruptions materially impacted the Company’s revenues and the Company recognized materially less revenues, or in some cases, no revenues, across a number of areas. In fiscal year 2022, the Company’s operations and operating results were also impacted by temporary declines in attendance due to ongoing reduced tourism levels as well as an increase in COVID-19 cases during certain months of the fiscal year.
Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021
In March 2020, the NBA and NHL suspended their 2019-20 seasons due to COVID-19. As a result of the suspension of the 2019-20 NBA and NHL seasons and subsequent resumption of play in July and August 2020, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company recognized certain revenues that otherwise would have been recognized during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020.
In addition, the start of the 2020-21 NBA and NHL regular seasons were delayed. The Knicks and the Rangers did not start their seasons until December 16, 2020 and January 14, 2021, respectively, initially with no fans and then with fan attendance limited to 10% capacity starting on February 23 and February 26, respectively, due to government-mandated assembly restrictions.
Effective May 19, 2021, event venues such as The Garden were permitted to host guests at full capacity, subject to certain restrictions, including, for example, restrictions for unvaccinated guests. As a result, the Knicks played three home playoff games with ticket sales of approximately 15,000-16,500 per game during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. During the 2020-2021 season, the Knicks and the Rangers each played fewer games than their traditional 82-game regular season schedules, with the NBA playing a 72-game regular season schedule and the NHL playing a 56-game regular season schedule.
These disruptions materially impacted the Company’s revenues across a number of areas, including, ticket sales; the Company’s share of suite licenses; sponsorships; signage and in-venue advertising at The Garden; local media rights fees; and food, beverage and merchandise sales.
In connection with the MSGE Distribution, we entered into the Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment. At the time of the MSGE Distribution, the Garden was not available for use due to the government-mandated suspension of events in response to COVID-19, and was only available at reduced capacity beginning in December 2020 through May 2021. As a result, the Company was not required to pay license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements until games resumed at The Garden, and the Company paid substantially reduced fees while attendance was limited. Effective July 1, 2021, the Company began paying license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements in their full contractual amounts.
During fiscal year 2021, as a result of COVID-19, the Company implemented cost-reduction measures that included workforce reductions and limits on discretionary spending. In addition, as a result of the disruptions caused by COVID-19, certain operating expenses were reduced, including (i) payments to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements described above, (ii) NBA league assessments and day-of-game expenses for Knicks and Rangers games, and (iii) league revenue sharing, net of escrow and team personnel expense. These expense reductions did not fully offset revenue losses.
Fiscal Year 2022
Starting August 17, 2021, indoor entertainment venues such as The Garden were permitted to host guests at full capacity, subject to certain restrictions, including vaccination and/or mask requirements for guests. In March 2022, New York City lifted all COVID-19 vaccination requirements pertaining to guests and professional athletes at indoor entertainment venues such as The Garden. There are no capacity restrictions or vaccination requirements applicable to fan attendance at games at The Garden as of the date of this filing.
The Knicks and the Rangers each completed their full 82-game regular season schedules for the 2021-22 season in April 2022 and the Rangers competed in the playoffs in May and June 2022, playing ten home playoff games in total. Fan attendance during fiscal year 2022 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of certain variants and ongoing reduced tourism levels.
It is unclear to what extent COVID-19 concerns, including with respect to new variants, could result in renewed governmental and league restrictions on attendance or otherwise impact attendance of games at The Garden.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended June 30, 2022 versus the Year Ended June 30, 2021
The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.
NM - Percentage is not meaningful
(a) Operating results in the prior year were materially impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Please see “- Factors Affecting Operating Results - Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business” for more information.
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased $405,633, or 98%, to $821,354 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:
The increase in pre/regular season ticket-related revenues was a result of increased attendance due to the elimination of government-mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year. In the prior year, the Knicks and the Rangers played games at The Garden with no fans in attendance until February 23 and 26, 2021, respectively, and after that, played games with attendance restricted to 10% capacity.
The increase in suite license fee revenues was a result of the elimination of government-mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year, as discussed above. In the prior year, for Knicks and Rangers games played with a limited number of fans in attendance, access to suites was sold by way of individual tickets and, as a result, minimal suite license fee revenues were recognized.
The increase in playoff related revenues was primarily due to the Rangers playing ten home playoff games as the team advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in the current year as compared to the Knicks playing three home playoff games in the prior year.
The increase in sponsorship and signage revenues was a result of the shortened NBA and NHL 2020-21 regular season schedules in the prior year, as well as the elimination of government mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year, as discussed above.
The increase in pre/regular season food, beverage and merchandise sales was a result of increased attendance due to the elimination of government-mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year, as discussed above.
The increase in local media rights fees was primarily due to the impact of the shortened NBA and NHL 2020-21 regular season schedules in the prior year, as well as contractual rate increases. The increase was slightly offset by the recognition of local media rights fees in the prior year associated with the Rangers’ participation in the Stanley Cup Qualifiers.
The decrease in revenues from league distributions was primarily due to the recognition of (i) the remainder of national media rights fees related to the 2019-20 NBA and NHL seasons during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 that otherwise would have been recognized during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 and (ii) a $21,043 expansion fee from the NHL in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by increased NBA and NHL national media rights fees and other league distributions in the current year.
Direct operating expenses
Direct operating expenses generally include:
•compensation expense for our sports teams’ players and certain other team personnel;
•arena license fees recognized as operating lease costs associated with the Knicks and the Rangers playing home games at The Garden;
•cost of team personnel transactions for waivers/contract termination costs, trades, and season-ending player injuries (net of anticipated insurance recoveries) of players and other team personnel;
•NBA and NHL revenue sharing (net of escrow), league assessments and NBA luxury tax receipts; and
•the cost of merchandise sales.
Direct operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased $218,674, or 78%, to $500,564 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:
Net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax were as follows:
The increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow) and NBA luxury tax was primarily due to higher provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow) of $102,589 as a result of higher escrow recoveries and lower revenue sharing expense in the prior year, which reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher recoveries of NBA luxury tax in the current year.
The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2020-21 season and, therefore, received an equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams. The Knicks’ roster as of June 30, 2022 did not result in the team being a luxury tax payer for the 2021-22 season and the Company will receive an equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that are distributed to non-tax paying teams.
The actual amounts for the 2021-22 seasons may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors.
The increase in team personnel compensation was primarily due to the impact of the shortened 2020-21 NBA and NHL regular seasons in the prior year and higher player compensation in the current year, partially offset by the recognition of player compensation expense during the prior year that otherwise would have been recognized during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the NBA completing the 2019-20 season in October 2020.
The increase in other team operating expenses not discussed elsewhere in the table was a result of the elimination of government-mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year, as discussed above. Other team operating expenses primarily consists of league assessments and expenses associated with day-to-day operations, including variable day-of-event costs incurred at The Garden, team travel and player insurance.
The increase in operating lease costs associated with the Knicks and the Rangers playing home games at The Garden was primarily a result of the elimination of government-mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year, as discussed above.
The increase in playoff related expenses was primarily due to the Rangers playing ten home playoff games as the team advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in the current year as compared to the Knicks playing three home playoff games in the prior year.
The increase in pre/regular season expense associated with merchandise sales was a result of increased attendance due to the elimination of government-mandated assembly restrictions at The Garden that were in place during the prior year, as discussed above.
Net provisions for certain team personnel transactions were as follows:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of (i) administrative costs, including compensation, professional fees, costs under the Company’s services agreement with MSG Entertainment, (ii) fees related to the Company’s sponsorship sales and service representation agreements, and (iii) sales and marketing costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased $22,968, or 11%, to $229,668 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher (i) marketing costs, (ii) playoff related expenses, (iii) fees related to the Company’s sponsorship sales and service representation agreements with MSG Entertainment, (iv) costs related to the Company’s services agreement with MSG Entertainment and (v) other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower employee compensation and related benefits, including the absence of severance related to team executives incurred in the prior year.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the year ended June 30, 2022 decreased $532, or 10%, to $5,042 as compared to the prior year.
Operating income (loss)
For the year ended June 30, 2022, operating income of $86,080 improved $164,523 as compared to the prior year. The improvement to operating income was primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher direct operating costs and, to a lesser extent, higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
Interest expense, net
Net interest expense increased $893 to $11,422 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by (i) increased interest expense under the Knicks revolving credit facility as a result of higher interest rates, (ii) interest expense related to the advances received in March 2021 under the 2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement, and (iii) acceleration of certain previously incurred financing costs when the Company terminated the 2020 Knicks Holdings Revolving Credit Facility in its entirety during December 2021, partially offset by decreased interest expense under the Rangers revolving credit facility as a result of principal repayments made during the current year.
Income taxes
Income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2022 of $25,052 differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to pretax income primarily due to state and local tax expense of $8,763 and nondeductible officers’ compensation of $5,156, partially offset by a change in the estimated tax rate used to determine deferred taxes of $3,191 and return to provision adjustments of $2,476. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the statutory federal rate to the effective tax rate.
Income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $73,421 differs from the income tax benefit derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to pretax loss primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance of $52,108 and state and local tax benefit of $7,331, partially offset by nondeductible officers’ compensation of $4,081.
Adjusted operating income (loss)
The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is operating income (loss) excluding (i) deferred rent expense under the Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment, (ii) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, (iii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iv) restructuring charges or credits, (v) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, (vi) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions, and (vii) gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (which was established in November 2021), which is referred to as adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure.
Management believes that given the length of the Arena License Agreements and resulting magnitude of the difference in deferred rent expense and the cash rent payments, the exclusion of deferred rent expense provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company's operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the Company’s business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. In addition, management believes that the exclusion of gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which are included for the first time this period, provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company’s operating performance given that, in accordance with GAAP, gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan are recognized in Operating (income) loss whereas gains and losses related to the remeasurement of the assets under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which are equal to and therefore fully offset the gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities, are recognized in Miscellaneous income (expense), net, which is not reflected in Operating income (loss).
The Company believes adjusted operating income (loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating income (loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company’s performance. The Company uses revenues and adjusted operating income (loss) measures as the most important indicators of its business performance and evaluates management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.
Adjusted operating income (loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted operating income (loss).
The following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss):
For the year ended June 30, 2022, adjusted operating income of $142,211 improved $154,741 as compared to the prior year. The improvement to adjusted operating income was primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher direct operating costs and, to a lesser extent, higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our operations and operating results were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and government and league actions taken in response during fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Our operations and operating results were also impacted by temporary declines in attendance in fiscal year 2022, due to ongoing reduced tourism levels as well as an increase in cases during certain months of the fiscal year due to COVID-19 variants. For more information about the impacts and risks to the Company as a result of COVID-19, see “- Factors Affecting Operating Results - Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Sports Business Risks - Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and May in the Future be, Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Government and League Actions Taken in Response”. In addition, see also Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities as well as cash flow from our operations. On December 14, 2021, the Company amended and extended the 2020 Knicks Credit Agreement and the 2020 Rangers Credit Agreement. In addition, in March 2021, pursuant to the 2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement (the “2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement”), the NHL advanced the Company $30,000, which the league made available to each team. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the 2021 Knicks Credit Agreement, 2021 Rangers Credit Agreement, and 2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement.
Our principal uses of cash include the operation of our businesses, working capital-related items, the repayment of outstanding debt, and potential repurchases of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $91,000 in Cash and cash equivalents. In addition, as of June 30, 2022, the Company’s deferred revenue obligations were approximately $141,176, net of billed, but not yet collected deferred revenue. The current portion of this balance is primarily comprised of obligations in connection with tickets and suites. In addition, the Company’s deferred revenue obligations included $30,000 from the NBA, which the league provided to each team.
We regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, management’s view of a favorable allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, restrictions imposed by the NBA and NHL and challenging U.S. and global economic and market conditions could adversely impact its ability to do so at that time.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately $91,000 in Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, along with $305,000 of additional available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities, to fund our operations and satisfy any obligations, including with respect to the return or application of deferred revenue, for the foreseeable future.
Financing Agreements and Stock Repurchases
See Note 13 and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of the Company’s debt obligations and various financing agreements, and the Company’s stock repurchases, respectively.
Cash Flow Discussion
The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flow activities for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021:
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $178,056 as compared to net cash used in operating activities in the prior year of $35,326. This was primarily due to the increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items and, to a lesser extent, changes in working capital assets and liabilities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by $2,466 to $2,932 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher other investing activities and capital expenditures in the current year.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $156,142 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in the prior year of $17,155. This was due to (i) principal repayments on the 2021 Rangers Credit Agreement in the current year period, (ii) proceeds from the 2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement in the prior year as compared to none in the current year, and (iii) additional borrowings in the prior year under the amended and extended 2021 Knicks Credit Agreement and 2021 Rangers Credit Agreement (prior to the amendment and restatement thereof) as compared to no borrowings in the current year.
Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
Future cash payments required under contracts entered into by the Company in the normal course of business as of June 30, 2022 are summarized in the following table:
_________________
(a)Contractual obligations not reflected on the balance sheet consist principally of the Company’s obligations under employment agreements that the Company has with certain of its professional sports teams’ personnel where services are to be performed in future periods and that are generally guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination.
(b)Includes contractually obligated minimum license fees under the Arena License Agreement, which fees are characterized as lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year under GAAP. These commitments are presented exclusive of the imputed interest used to reflect the payment’s present value. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the contractual obligations related to future lease payments, which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as lease liabilities as of June 30, 2022.
(c)Consists of amounts drawn under the 2021 Knicks Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
(d)Contractual obligations reflected on the balance sheet consist principally of the Company’s obligations under employment agreements that the Company has with certain of its professional sports teams’ personnel where services have been fully performed and that are being paid on a deferred basis.
(e)Pension obligations have been excluded from the table above as the timing of the future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s pension obligations.
Seasonality of Our Business
The Company’s dependence on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means that it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company’s fiscal year. On March 11 and 12, 2020, respectively, the NBA and NHL suspended their 2019-20 seasons due to COVID-19. In July and August 2020, the NBA and NHL, respectively, resumed their seasons and the NHL and NBA subsequently completed their seasons in September and October 2020, respectively. As a result, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company recognized certain revenues that otherwise would have typically been recognized during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. In addition, due to the delayed start of the 2020-21 NBA and NHL seasons in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively, the Company recognized certain revenues during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021, that otherwise would have typically been recognized during the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2021.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Management believes its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
The Company has contracts with customers, including multi-year sponsorship agreements, that contain multiple performance obligations. Payment terms for such arrangements can vary by contract, but payments are generally due in installments throughout the contractual term. The performance obligations included in each sponsorship agreement vary and may include various advertising benefits such as, but not limited to, signage, digital advertising, and event or property specific advertising, as well as non-advertising benefits such as suite licenses and event tickets. To the extent the Company’s multi-year arrangements provide for performance obligations that are consistent over the multi-year contractual term, such performance obligations generally meet the definition of a series as provided for under the accounting guidance. If performance obligations meet the definition of a series, the contractual fees for all years during the contract term are aggregated and the related revenue is recognized proportionately as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.
The timing of revenue recognition for each performance obligation is dependent upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the Company’s satisfaction of its respective performance obligation. The Company allocates the transaction price for such arrangements to each performance obligation within the arrangement based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the performance obligation. The Company’s process for determining its estimated standalone selling prices involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors including company specific and market specific factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Key factors considered by the Company in developing an estimated standalone selling price for its performance obligations include, but are not limited to, prices charged for similar performance obligations, the Company’s ongoing pricing strategy and policies, and consideration of pricing of similar performance obligations sold in other arrangements with multiple performance obligations.
The Company may incur costs such as commissions to obtain its multi-year sponsorship agreements. The Company assesses such costs for capitalization on a contract by contract basis. To the extent costs are capitalized, the Company estimates the useful life of the related contract asset which may be the underlying contract term or the estimated customer life depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the contract. The contract asset is amortized over the estimated useful life.
Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets
The Company’s long-lived and indefinite-lived assets accounted for approximately 29% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2022 and consisted of the following:
In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, the Company must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve significant uncertainties and judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its long-lived and/or indefinite-lived assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is the same as or one level below the operating segment level. The Company has one operating and reportable segment, and for the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company had one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have
occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the amount of an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value determined in step one, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss was recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for the Company’s reporting unit for the fiscal year 2022 impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as:
•macroeconomic conditions;
•industry and market considerations;
•market capitalization;
•cost factors;
•overall financial performance of the reporting unit;
•other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and
•relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets.
The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, and there was no impairment of goodwill. Based on this impairment test, the Company’s reporting unit had sufficient safety margins, defined as the excess of the amount by which the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The most recent quantitative assessments were used in making this determination. The Company believes that if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.
Identifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022:
The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assessments considered the events
and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. Examples of such events and circumstances include:
•cost factors;
•financial performance;
•legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors;
•other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers;
•industry and market considerations; and
•macroeconomic conditions.
The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, and there were no impairments identified. Based on this impairment test, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of each identifiable indefinite-lived intangible asset’s estimated fair value over its respective carrying value. The Company believes that if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.
Lease Accounting
The Company’s leases primarily consist of the lease of the Company’s corporate offices under the Sublease Agreement with MSG Entertainment (the “Sublease Agreement”) for our principal executive offices at Two Pennsylvania Plaza in New York and the lease of CLG Performance Center. In, addition, the Company accounts for the rights of use of The Garden pursuant to the Arena License Agreements as leases under the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases. The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If a lease is determined to exist, the lease term is assessed based on the date when the underlying asset is made available for the Company’s use by the lessor. The Company’s assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancelable term of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options which the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise, as well as periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation reflected in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.
For leases with a term exceeding 12 months, a lease liability is recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement reflecting the present value of the fixed minimum payment obligations over the lease term. A corresponding right of use (“ROU”) asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recorded, adjusted for any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease and reduced by any lease incentives received.
The Company includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities, as the Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separate from operating leases ROU assets and are included within Property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of the Company’s fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, as rates implicit in the underlying leasing arrangements are typically not readily determinable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis and incorporates the term and economic environment surrounding the associated lease.
On April 17, 2020, in connection with the MSGE Distribution, we entered into a sublease agreement with MSG Entertainment (the “Sublease Agreement”) for our principal executive offices at Two Pennsylvania Plaza in New York. The Sublease Agreement right of use assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet at lease commencement based on the present value of minimum base rent and other fixed payments over the reasonably certain lease term.
In November 2021, MSG Entertainment entered into a new lease for principal executive offices at Two Pennsylvania Plaza in New York (the “New MSGE Lease Agreement”). In accordance with the terms of the Sublease Agreement and the New MSGE Lease Agreement, the lease term of the Sublease Agreement was extended until October 31, 2024. The Company has accounted for this extension as a lease remeasurement and remeasured the right-of-use asset and operating lease liability utilizing the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as of the date of remeasurement.
In accordance with the terms of the Sublease Agreement, the Company has committed to enter into a new sublease agreement with MSG Entertainment for a lease term equivalent to the New MSGE Lease Agreement term, which ends January 31, 2046. In addition, in connection with the New MSGE Lease Agreement, the Company has entered into a commitment whereby if the New MSGE Lease Agreement were terminated under certain circumstances, the Company would be required to enter into a new lease for executive offices in Two Pennsylvania Plaza directly with the landlord, with a consistent lease term through January 31, 2046. As the Company has not yet entered into a new sublease for or taken possession of the new executive office space at Two
Pennsylvania Plaza, no additional right-of-use assets or operating lease liabilities have been recorded as of June 30, 2022 related to the commitments discussed above.
In addition, in connection with the MSGE Distribution we entered into long term leases with MSG Entertainment that end June 30, 2055 and allow the Knicks and the Rangers to play their home games at The Garden. The Arena License Agreements provide for fixed payments to be made from inception through June 30, 2055 in 12 equal installments during each year of the contractual term. The contracted license fee for the first full contract year ending June 30, 2021 was approximately $22,500 for the Knicks and approximately $16,700 for the Rangers, and then for each subsequent year, the license fees are 103% of the license fees for the immediately preceding contract year.
At the time of the MSGE Distribution, the Garden was not available for use due to the government-mandated suspension of events in response to COVID-19, and was only available at reduced capacity beginning in December 2020 through May 2021. As a result, the Company was not required to pay license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements until games resumed at The Garden, and the Company paid substantially reduced fees while attendance was limited. Effective July 1, 2021, the Company began paying license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements in their full contractual amounts.
The Knicks and the Rangers are entitled to use The Garden on home game days, which are usually nonconsecutive, for a pre-defined period of time from before and after the game. In evaluating the Company’s lease cost, the Company considered the timing of payments throughout the lease terms and the nonconsecutive periods of use, provided for within each license. While payments are made throughout the contract year in twelve equal installments under each arrangement, the periods of use only span each of the individual team event days. As such, the Company concluded that the related straight-line operating lease costs should be recorded by each team equally over each team’s individual event days.
As part of Arena License Agreements, we recognized license fees which are characterized as operating lease liabilities and a right of use assets. We measured the lease liabilities at the present value of the future lease payments as of April 17, 2020 and remeasured the lease liabilities during the period that The Garden was not available for use as discussed above. We use our incremental borrowing rates based on the remaining lease term to determine the present value of future lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms.
Our incremental borrowing rate is calculated as the weighted average risk-free rate plus a spread to reflect our current unsecured credit rating. We subsequently measure the lease liability at the present value of the future lease payments as of the reporting date with a corresponding adjustment to the right-to-use asset. Absent a lease modification we will continue to utilize the April 17, 2020 incremental borrowing rate.
Estimation of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment by management and reflects an assessment of credit standing to derive an implied secured credit rating and corresponding yield curve. Changes in management’s estimates of discount rate assumptions could result in a significant overstatement or understatement of right of use assets or lease liabilities, resulting in an adverse impact to MSG Sports’ financial position. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our leases.
