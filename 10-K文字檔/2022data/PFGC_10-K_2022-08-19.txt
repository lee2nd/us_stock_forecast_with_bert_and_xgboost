Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K.
Our Company
We market and distribute over 250,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from approximately 142 distribution facilities to over 300,000 customer locations in the “food-away-from-home” industry. We offer our customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally branded products, and products bearing our customers’ brands. Our product assortment ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed its operating segments to reflect the manner in which the business is managed. Based on the Company’s organization structure and how the Company’s management reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company now has three reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Our Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or “Performance Brands.” Foodservice sells to independent and multi-unit “Chain” restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and retail establishments. Our Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Our Convenience channel distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice products and other items to convenience stores across the United States and Canada. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2022, a 53-week year for fiscal 2021 and a 52-week year for fiscal 2020. References to “fiscal 2022” are to the 52-week period ended July 2, 2022, references to “fiscal 2021” are to the 53-week period ended July 3, 2021, and references to “fiscal 2020” are to the 52-week period ended June 27, 2020.
Key Factors Affecting Our Business
Our business, our industry and the U.S. economy are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, the recent rise in the rate of inflation and fuel prices, interest rates, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. We continue to actively monitor the impacts of the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape on all aspects of our business. During fiscal 2022, economic and operating conditions for our business improved significantly due to the declining adverse effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company and our industry may continue to face challenges as the recovery continues, such as availability of product supply, increased product and logistics costs, access to labor supply, lower disposable incomes due to inflationary pressures and macroeconomic conditions, and the emergence of COVID-19 variants. The extent to which these challenges will affect our future financial position, liquidity, and results of operations remains uncertain.
We believe that our long-term performance is principally affected by the following key factors:
•Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. Until recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry has increased steadily for several decades. The share increases in periods of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The foodservice distribution industry is
also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods.
•Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers’ satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry.
•Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for both of our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers.
Net Sales
Net sales is equal to gross sales, plus excise taxes, minus sales returns; minus sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.
Gross Profit
Gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management measures operating performance based on our EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Our definition of EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of our performance. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our segments and for business planning purposes. We present EBITDA in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede GAAP measures.
In addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our ABL Facility and indentures (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our ABL Facility and indentures governing the Notes due 2025, Notes due 2027, and Notes due 2029 relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our ABL Facility and indentures, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in our ABL Facility and indentures). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties,
including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes due 2025, Notes due 2027, and Notes due 2029, in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management’s performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:
•exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;
•do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;
•do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and
•do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt.
In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our ABL Facility and indentures. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:
•does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges; and
•does not include acquisition, restructuring, and other costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations.
We have included below reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented.
Results of Operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA
The following table sets forth a summary of our results of operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, except per share data):
We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income. The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented:
(1)Includes adjustments for non-cash charges arising from stock-based compensation and gain/loss on disposal of assets. Stock-based compensation cost was $44.0 million, $25.4 million and $17.9 million for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. In addition, this includes increases in the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) reserve of $31.9 million for Foodservice and $91.0 million for Convenience for fiscal 2022 compared to increases of $11.8 million for Foodservice and $24.6 million for Convenience for fiscal 2021 and an increase of $0.8 million for Foodservice and $3.1 million for Convenience for fiscal 2020.
(2)Includes professional fees and other costs related to completed and abandoned acquisitions, costs of integrating certain of our facilities, and facility closing costs.
(3)Consists primarily of amounts related to fuel collar derivatives, certain financing transactions, lease amendments, legal settlements, franchise tax expense, insurance proceeds, and other adjustments permitted by our ABL Facility.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Fiscal year ended July 2, 2022 compared to fiscal year ended July 3, 2021
Net Sales
Net sales growth is primarily a function of acquisitions, case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $20.5 billion, or 67.4%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.
The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Core-Mark on September 1, 2021, which contributed $14.5 billion of net sales in fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales was also driven by growth in cases sold, an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2021. Overall product cost inflation was approximately 11.9% for fiscal 2022. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2021 were approximately $664.6 million. Case volume increased 28.8% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Organic case volume increased 7.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, organic case volume increased 10.3% in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $1.7 billion, or 49.1%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the acquisition of Core-Mark, partially offset by a $122.9 million increase in the LIFO reserve and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. The acquisition of Core-Mark contributed gross profit of $846.5 million since the acquisition date. Also, gross profit increased due to case growth in Foodservice and an increase in the gross profit per case driven by growth in the independent channel. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. The gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $76.1 million.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $1.6 billion, or 48.3%, for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of Core-Mark, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Core-Mark contributed an additional $761.8 million operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, since the acquisition date.
Operating expenses also increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as an increase in personnel expenses. In fiscal 2022, the Company experienced a $81.2 million increase in temporary contract labor costs, including travel expenses associated with contract workers, compared to the prior year period, as a result of the labor market's impact on the Company's ability to hire and retain qualified labor. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company's use of temporary contract labor normalized to a level consistent with historical usage. Operating expenses also experienced an increase in fuel expense of $90.9 million due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2022 compared to prior year. Additionally, the Company had increases in workers' compensation and automobile insurance expense of $20.6 million, an increase in professional fees of $23.2 million due to recent acquisitions, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $18.6 million. The Company estimates operating expenses for the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $70.4 million.
Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $338.9 million in fiscal 2021 to $462.8 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of 36.6%. Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of the Core-Mark acquisition and another recent acquisition, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Total depreciation and amortization related to the acquisition of Core-Mark was $109.7 million. Total depreciation and amortization related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $6.6 million.
Net Income
Net income was $112.5 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $40.7 million for fiscal 2021. This increase in net income was attributable to the $126.7 million increase in operating profit and an increase in other income, partially offset by increases in interest expense and income tax expense. The increase in other income primarily relates to realized and unrealized gains on fuel hedging instruments. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in average borrowings outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.
The Company reported income tax expense of $54.6 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $14.0 million for fiscal 2021. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 was 32.7% compared to 25.6% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 differed from the prior year due to the increase of non-deductible expenses as a percentage of book income. including $4.2 million of tax related to non-deductible transaction costs incurred for acquisitions, and the decrease in deductible stock-based compensation as a percentage of book income. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was impacted by a benefit from a federal net operating loss carryback to tax years with a statutory rate higher than the current statutory tax rate.
Fiscal year ended July 3, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 27, 2020
Net Sales
Net sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $5,312.6 million, or 21.2%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Reinhart Foodservice, L.L.C. (“Reinhart”) on December 31, 2019, along with the 53rd week in fiscal year 2021. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2021 were approximately $664.6 million. The acquisition of Reinhart contributed $6,049.3 million of net sales in fiscal 2021, compared to $2,525.0 million in fiscal 2020.
Case volume increased 15.4% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, case volume increased 13.0% compared to the prior year.

Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $656.0 million, or 22.9%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the acquisition of Reinhart and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. The acquisition of Reinhart contributed an increase in gross profit of $501.4 million for fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year. Also, gross profit increased due to an increase in the gross profit per case driven by case growth in Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. The Company estimates the increase in gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $76.1 million.
Additionally, for fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a total of $36.9 million of inventory write-offs primarily as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, compared to $54.5 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease was primarily a result of the recent improvements in economic conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 11.6% for fiscal 2021 compared to 11.4% for fiscal 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $356.3 million, or 12.0%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of Reinhart and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Reinhart contributed an additional $315.6 million of operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The Company estimates operating expenses for the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $70.4 million.
Excluding the impact of Reinhart and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, operating expenses decreased as a result of a decrease in contingent consideration accretion expense of $109.7 million, professional fees of $28.4 million, and insurance expense of $6.2 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a benefit of $24.9 million related to reserves related to expected credit losses for customer receivables, as compared to bad debt expense of $78.0 million in the prior year.

Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $276.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $338.9 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 22.7%. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Reinhart. Total depreciation and amortization related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $6.6 million.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income was $40.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to a net loss of $114.1 million for fiscal 2020. This increase in net income was attributable to the $299.7 million increase in operating profit, partially offset by increases in interest expense and income tax expense. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in average borrowings outstanding along with a higher average interest rate during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
The Company reported income tax expense of $14.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $108.1 million for fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 was 25.6% compared to 48.6% in fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to state taxes, stock compensation, and discrete items as a percentage of book income, which is significantly higher than the book income for fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the $46.3 million benefit from a federal net operating loss carryback to tax years with a statutory tax rate higher than the current statutory tax rate.
Segment Results
As previously disclosed, in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed its operating segments to reflect the manner in which the business is managed. Based on the Company’s organization structure and how the Company’s management reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company's three reportable segments are: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on various operating and financial metrics, including their respective sales growth and EBITDA.
Corporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operating segments that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size, including the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense.
The presentation and amounts for the fiscal years ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 have been restated to reflect the segment changes described above.
The following tables set forth net sales and EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):

Net Sales
Net sales for Vistar decreased $626.4 million, or 19.8%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Due to the restrictions implemented by governments to slow the spread of COVID-19, there were significant declines in case volume in the theater, office coffee service, office supply, hospitality, and travel channels for fiscal 2021, however, these declines gradually improved, as certain states eased restrictions allowing many of our customers in these channels to resume operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The decline in net sales was partially offset by approximately $57.2 million in net sales for the 53rd week in fiscal 2021.
EBITDA
EBITDA for Vistar decreased $38.3 million, or 31.9%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. The gross profit decrease of $64.2 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, was driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the channels we serve, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $9.4 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Additionally, for fiscal 2021, Vistar recorded $4.3 million of inventory write-offs primarily as result of the impact of COVID-19 on the channels we serve, which was a decrease of $9.3 million compared to the prior year.

Additionally, in fiscal 2021, Vistar recorded a benefit of $2.0 million related to reserves for expected credit losses for customer receivables as compared to bad debt expense of $14.4 million for the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense of $15.9 million for fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility (currently our ABL Facility), operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal quarters. We borrow under our credit facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity.
As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt.
Our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond relate to our long-term debt and associated interest payments, operating and finance leases, and purchase obligations. For information regarding the Company’s expected cash requirements related to long-term debt and operating and finance leases, see Note 8. Debt and Note 12. Leases, respectively, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had total purchase obligations of $163.9 million, which includes agreements for purchases related to capital projects and services in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, as well as a minimum amount due for various Company meetings and conferences. Purchase obligations also include amounts committed to various capital projects in process or scheduled to be completed in the coming fiscal years. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had commitments of $101.8 million for capital projects related to warehouse expansion and improvements and warehouse equipment. The Company anticipates using cash flows from operations or borrowings under the ABL Facility to fulfill these commitments. Amounts due under these agreements were not included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of July 2, 2022.
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond, to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes, and to fund capital expenditures.
At July 2, 2022, our cash balance totaled $18.7 million, including restricted cash of $7.1 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling $22.2 million, including restricted cash of $11.1 million, at July 3, 2021.

The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was largely driven by higher operating income and the prior year payment of $117.3 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Eby-Brown, partially offset by net income tax refunds of $117.4 million in fiscal 2021 and investments in working capital in fiscal 2022. Toward the end of fiscal 2022, the Company made advanced purchases of $220.3 million of tobacco related inventory to take advantage of preferred pricing and as a result of one of the Company's cigarette suppliers shutting down for a system conversion.

The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was largely driven by larger investments in net working capital and the payment of $117.3 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Eby-Brown, partially offset by net income tax refunds of $117.4 million received during fiscal 2021.
Investing Activities

The $110.0 million Additional Junior Term Loan was paid of early and in full in fiscal 2021.
On September 17, 2021, PFGC and Performance Food Group, Inc. entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “ABL Facility”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amended the Prior Credit Agreement. The ABL Facility, among other things, (i) increased the aggregate principal amount available under the revolving loan facility from $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion, (ii) extended the stated maturity date from December 30, 2024 to September 17, 2026, and (iii) included an alternative reference rate, which provides mechanisms for the use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a replacement rate upon a LIBOR cessation event.

Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders.
Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc.’s option, at (a) the Base Rate (defined as the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such date plus 0.5%, (ii) the Prime Rate on such day, or (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus a spread, or (b) LIBOR plus a spread. The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee rate of 0.25% per annum.
The following table summarizes outstanding borrowings, availability, and the average interest rate under the credit facility in place as of the applicable date:
The ABL Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if excess availability falls below the greater of (i) $320.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the revolving credit facility amount for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the loan parties’ and their subsidiaries abilities to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments or specified payments, and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under the ABL Facility may be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders may be exercised, including rights with respect to the collateral securing the obligations under such agreement.

Such minimum estimated restricted payment capacity is calculated based on the most restrictive of our debt agreements and may fluctuate from period to period, which fluctuations may be material. Our restricted payment capacity under other debt instruments to which the Company is subject may be materially higher than the foregoing estimate.
As of July 2, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Notes due 2025, the Notes due 2027, and the Notes due 2029.
Total Assets by Segment
Total assets by segment discussed below exclude intercompany receivables between segments and amounts as of July 3, 2021 have been restated to reflect the changes to our reportable segments that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Total assets for Foodservice increased $663.6 million from $5,791.7 million as of July 3, 2021 to $6,455.3 million as of July 2, 2022. During this period, this segment increased its inventory, property, plant, and equipment, accounts receivable, and goodwill primarily due to a recent acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets.
Total assets for Vistar increased $84.0 million from $1,049.7 million as of July 3, 2021 to $1,133.7 million as of July 2, 2022. During this period, Vistar increased its inventory and accounts receivable.
Total assets for Convenience increased $3,729.7 million from $681.9 million as of July 3, 2021 to $4,411.6 million as of July 2, 2022. During this period, this segment increased its inventory, goodwill, accounts receivable, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and operating lease right-of-use assets as a result of the Core-Mark acquisition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to portraying our financial position and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those that pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, insurance programs, income taxes, vendor rebates and promotional incentives, and goodwill and other intangible assets.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business, are recorded at the invoiced amount, and primarily do not bear interest. Receivables are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We regularly analyze our significant customer accounts, and when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as a bankruptcy filing or a deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible. We also record reserves for bad debt for other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, macroeconomic considerations, and historical experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
Inventory Valuation
Our inventories consist primarily of food and non-food products. The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and last-in, first-out ("LIFO") using the link chain technique of the dollar value method.
FIFO was used for approximately 57% of total inventories at July 2, 2022. We adjust our inventory balances for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories. These adjustments are based upon inventory category, inventory age, specifically identified items, and overall economic conditions.
Insurance Programs
We maintain high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers’ compensation. The amounts in excess of the deductibles are insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. We also maintain self-funded group medical insurance. We accrue our estimated liability for these deductibles, including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims, based on known claims and past claims history. The estimated short-term portion of these accruals is included in Accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets, while the estimated long-term portion of the accruals is included in Other long-term liabilities. The provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claims occurrence, as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid. These insurance programs are managed by a third party, and the deductibles for general and vehicle liability and workers compensation are primarily collateralized by letters of credit and restricted cash.
Income Taxes
We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740-10, Income Taxes-Overall, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Future tax benefits, including net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. Income tax calculations are based on the tax laws enacted as of the date of the financial statements.
Vendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives
We participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, either unilaterally or in combination with purchasing cooperatives and other procurement partners, that consist primarily of volume and growth rebates, annual and multi-year incentives, and promotional programs. Consideration received under these incentives is generally recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. However, in certain limited circumstances the consideration is recorded as a reduction of costs incurred by us. Consideration received may be in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions. Changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received are treated as changes in estimates and are recognized in the period of change.
Consideration received for volume and growth rebates, annual incentives, and multi-year incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the Company toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual and multi-year incentives when earned, generally over the agreement period. We use current and historical purchasing data, forecasted purchasing volumes, and other factors in estimating whether the underlying objectives or milestones will be achieved. Consideration received to promote and sell the supplier’s products is typically a reimbursement of marketing costs incurred by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of our operating expenses. If the amount of consideration received from the suppliers exceeds our marketing costs, any excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold.
Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to those tangible net assets acquired in a business combination. Other identifiable intangible assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, technology, non-compete agreements, and favorable lease assets. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which generally range from two to eleven years. Annually, or when certain triggering events occur, the Company assesses the useful lives of its intangibles with definite lives. Certain assumptions, estimates, and judgments are used in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the reporting units. Accordingly, we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of
future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), economic barriers to entry, a brand’s relative market position, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate. Indicators of goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, significant declines in the markets and industries that buy our products, changes in the estimated future cash flows of its reporting units, changes in capital markets, and changes in its market capitalization.
We apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Testing Goodwill for Impairment,” which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as “step zero”) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill is necessary. In performing step zero for our goodwill impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present after performing step zero, we would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of goodwill.
During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we performed the step zero analysis for our goodwill impairment test. As a result of our step zero analysis, no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. There were no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.
