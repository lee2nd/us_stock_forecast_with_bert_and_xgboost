ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and other information presented elsewhere in this annual report.
OVERVIEW
We have decided to include in our sales efforts other products aside the concealed weapons detection system. Currently, customers can purchase extended warranties, which provide for replacement or repair of the unit beyond the period provided by the unconditional warranty. Warranties can be purchased for various periods but generally they are for a one-year period that begins after any other warranties expire.
In the short term, management plans to self-fund through friends and family investment of time and money. Then the next phase of our business plan will be to raise additional funds through common stock offerings to provide working capital to finance several acquisitions. In the past, when possible, we have conserved our cash by paying employees, consultants, and independent contractors with our common stock. On June 1, 2010, by majority shareholder consent, we adopted our 2010 Service Provider Stock Compensation Plan. Reserved for equity issuances under the Service Provider Stock Compensation Plan are 50,000,000 shares of our common stock. On July 21, 2010, we registered the common stock issuable under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2010 Service Provider Stock Compensation Plan. A total of 100,000,000 shares are reserved for issuances under the two plans.
Merger or Acquisitions other Significant events in 2020
On July 30, 2020, Charles Davis, the Company’s longtime accountant, received a letter from the IRS indicating under $ 10,000 owed in payroll taxes for several pay periods between 2012-2015. Although Mr. Davis died on November 24, 2021, the Company will continue to make efforts to resolve this issue and enter into a payment plan if necessary, once the amount owed is agreed upon. View Systems, Inc. has not had significant revenue and has a significant loss carry forward, therefore tax returns for recent years have not been filed. The Company plans on filing necessary tax returns in the future. View Systems has received a box of accounting records from the late Mr. Davis’ office that is being reviewed.

The Company had planned to spin out the security business into a wholly owned subsidiary, View Systems International, Inc. (VSII), offering a dividend of VSII shares to shareholders of record on February 19, 2021. Due to delays caused by the unexpected suspension, the Company is reassessing the dividend distribution, and exploring alternatives to capitalize their Colombia cannabis interest.
On June 2, 2021, the Company received a resignation letter from their independent auditor, Boyle CPA, LLC. To the Company’s knowledge, relative to their two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period before such dismissal, there were no substantial disagreements with Boyle CPA on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, remain unresolved.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
We have incurred losses from operations for the past three fiscal years and had a net operating loss of ($405,027) at fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Our revenues from product sales have ceased and are not sufficient to cover all of our operating expenses. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt that we can continue as a going concern. We are continuing to push acquiring other income streams.
Management intends to finance our 2020 operations primarily with loans and any cash short falls will be addressed through equity or debt financing, if available. Management expects revenues will continue to be non-existent in the short term but will increase in the long term as additional products are brought on-line moving forward. We will need to continue to raise additional capital, both internally and externally, to cover cash shortfalls and to compete in our markets. At our current revenue levels management believes we will require an additional $600,000 in equity financing during the next 12 months to satisfy our cash requirements of approximately $50,000 per month for operations and to facilitate our new business plans both in these bio-resource markets and the development of an advanced Detection Portal.
These operating costs include cost of sales, general and administrative expenses, salaries and benefits and professional fees related to contracting engineers. We have insufficient financing commitments in place to meet our expected cash requirements for 2020 and we cannot assure the company we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. If we cannot obtain financing to fund our operations in 2020, then we will be required to reduce our expenses and scale back our operations.
Going Concern
The market price of our common stock has fallen below the fixed price of our registered stock offering, as in prior years we may again have insufficient financing commitments in place to meet our expected cash requirements for 2020. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. If we cannot obtain financing to fund our operations in 2022 and beyond., then we may be required to further reduce our expenses and scale back our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. Footnote 2 to our financial statements provides additional explanation of Management’s views on our status as a going concern. The audited financial statements contained in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Our independent registered accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their reports on the accompanying financial statements for December 31, 2020 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We have one main products, namely the concealed weapons detection system. In all cases revenue is considered earned when the product is shipped to the customer, installed (if necessary) and accepted by the customer as a completed sale. Each product has an unconditional 30 day warranty, during which time the product can be returned for a complete refund. Customers can purchase extended warranties, which provide for replacement or repair of the unit beyond the period provided by the unconditional warranty. Warranties can be purchased for various periods but generally they are for one year period that begins after any other warranties expire. The revenue from warranties is recognized on a straight line bases over the period covered by the warranty. Prior to the issuance of financial statements management reviews any returns subsequent to the end of the accounting period which are from sales recognized during the accounting period, and makes appropriate adjustments as necessary. Product prices are fixed or determinable and products are only shipped when collectability is reasonably assured.
Stock Based Compensation
We account for share-based compensation at fair value. Stock based compensation cost for stock options granted to employees, board members and service providers is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
