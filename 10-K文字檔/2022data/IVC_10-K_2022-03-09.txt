Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
Management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Invacare is a multi-national company with integrated capabilities to design, manufacture and distribute durable medical devices. The company makes products that help people move, breathe, rest and perform essential hygiene, and with those products the company supports people with congenital, acquired and degenerative conditions. The company's products and solutions are important parts of care for people with a range of challenges, from those who are active and involved in work or school each day and may need additional mobility or respiratory support, to those who are cared for in residential care settings, at home and in rehabilitation centers. The company operates in facilities in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, which are the result of dozens of acquisitions made over the company's forty-two-year history. Some of these acquisitions have been combined into integrated operating units, while others have remained relatively independent.
COVID-19 Impact
The company continues to actively monitor the impact of the pandemic, which negatively impacted the company’s business in 2021 with regard to supply chain disruptions as it impacted both input costs and availability of components, resulting in reduced net sales on a global basis year-over-year and compressed gross margins. While the company took actions to mitigate the negative impact of higher input costs, the benefit of those actions continue to lag the impact from the supply chain disruptions, influenced by timing of pricing actions becoming effective. The company realized growth in its mobility and seating product category in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of improved access to healthcare and loosening of public health restrictions during the year. However, demand has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.
The company continues to experience high demand globally for its respiratory products which are being deployed in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The company continues to work to increase its capacity to produce these critical products and resolve global supply chain challenges that are compounded by the effects of the pandemic. However, the company has and continues to experience availability issues with electronic components which may limit the ability to increase output and meet this demand. In addition, the company has
continued to experience cost increases from pandemic-related supply chain disruptions.
The company experienced Omicron-related impacts during the first quarter of 2022 across its employee, production and supplier base, with the extent of the disruptions varying by country. The company experienced absenteeism early in the quarter as a result of Omicron which caused temporary inefficiencies in operations, and which have since subsided.
The extent to which the company’s operations will be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and difficult to accurately predict, including, among other things, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, such as reimposed public health restrictions or restrictions on access to healthcare facilities. In addition, supply chain disruptions continue to negatively impact the global economy and may affect the business including availability and cost of components and freight, which may have a negative impact on the company and results of operations, if mitigation actions are not effective.
Strategy
The company historically had a strategy to be a leading provider of durable medical equipment to health care providers in global markets by providing the broadest portfolio available. This strategy has not kept pace with certain reimbursement changes, competitive dynamics and company-specific challenges. Since 2015, the company has made a major shift in its strategy. The company has since been aligning its resources to produce products and solutions that assist customers and end-users with their most clinically complex needs. By focusing the company's efforts to provide the best possible assistance and outcomes to the people and caregivers who use its products, the company aims to improve its financial condition for sustainable profit and growth. As a result, the company is undertaking a substantial multi-year business optimization plan.
Business Optimization Efforts
The company continues to execute a multi-year strategy to return the company to profitability by focusing its resources on products and solutions that provide greater healthcare value in clinically complex rehabilitation and post-acute care.
Cost pressures on the business impacted by supply chain disruptions and inflationary economic conditions are anticipated to continue in 2022. While the company has implemented actions to mitigate these cost increases, additional actions may be needed to drive profitability and
cash. These actions may include further restructuring actions including organization optimization, supply chain rationalization, and product line rationalization for those product categories which do not deliver adequate profitability given the higher cost inputs being incurred. These actions are anticipated to result in restructuring costs, to the extent implemented, during 2022.
The company's business optimization actions balance product portfolio changes across all regions and cost improvements in supply chain and administrative functions. Key elements of the global business optimization plans are:
•Continue to drive all business segments and product lines based on their potential to achieve a leading market position and to support profitability goals;
•Simplify the organization to leverage a reduced cost structure while allocating resources to the business units or product categories which deliver improved financial returns;
•Product rationalization and discontinuation with consideration of cost increases incurred by the company and those anticipated to continue. Adjust the product portfolio to consistently grow profitability amid cost increases by adding new products, reducing costs and continuing to improve customer experiences; and,
•Take actions globally to reduce working capital and improve free cash flow.
As it navigates the uncertain business environment resulting from the pandemic, the company continues to allocate more resources to the business units experiencing increased demand and expects to continue taking actions to mitigate the potential negative financial and operational impacts on other parts of the business that have declined. In the medium-term, the company still expects to execute on its business optimization strategy, such as the global IT modernization initiative which is intended to optimize the operating structure.
In 2021, the company made significant progress to improve future financial performance and strengthened its overall business profile by taking actions such as:
•Introduced a new modern ERP, including e-commerce capabilities, in North America for non-configured products which is anticipated to improve the customer experience and deliver long-term cost savings;
•Launched innovative new products designed to drive incremental sales growth and expand margins;
•Implemented mitigation actions to offset higher material, freight and labor costs; and,
•Increased balance sheet flexibility with the issuance of new convertible notes which allowed the company to retire nearly all of its 2022 convertible notes and extend the overall debt maturity profile to 2026.
The company made substantial progress in 2021 with more work to be done in 2022. The company intends to continue to make significant investments in its business improvement initiatives with a focus on improving profitability and free cash flow generation. As a result, the company may take actions which may reduce sales in certain areas, refocus resources away from less profitable activities, and look at its global infrastructure for opportunities to further optimize the business. As part of the company’s efforts to streamline its operations and focus its resources on core product lines that provide the greatest value and financial returns, the company continuously evaluates opportunities and activities, including potential divestitures, which it considers from time to time, particularly if they involve businesses or assets outside of the company’s primary areas of focus.
Outlook
The company participates in durable healthcare markets and serves a persistent need for its products. By continuing to drive for improved operating efficiency, the company expects to grow revenue and profit, and improve its cash flow performance into the future.
Cost pressures on the business due to supply chain disruptions and inflationary economic conditions are anticipated to continue into 2022. The company continues to see higher input costs related to freight and materials, increasing the challenges to schedule deliveries of key components, including electronic components for respiratory and mobility and seating products. While the company has implemented actions to mitigate these cost increases, additional restructuring actions may be implemented to drive profit and improve cash flows. These restructuring actions may include organization simplification and supply chain rationalization. These actions are expected to include organization and supply chain changes and a narrowing of the product portfolio for those items which no longer meet customer or business needs. These actions are anticipated to take effect in 2022, with key initiatives being finalized during the second quarter. In addition, as part of its restructuring plans, the company anticipates incurring additional costs related to its restructuring actions.
Revenues for 2022 are not anticipated to increase, largely as a result of product rationalization and discontinuations which may not be completely mitigated by the pricing actions implemented by the business. In addition, sales volumes may be adversely impacted by customers reactions to the company's mitigation actions.
The company anticipates profit and free cash flow to improve for the full year compared to the prior year and sequentially for the last three quarters of the year as these expected profit improvement actions take effect.
The company recognizes that these near-term external factors, as well as cost associated with restructuring actions, may require balance sheet action, including additional financing to support working capital requirements. The company will continue to take actions to optimize its business as required to operate in the present landscape.
Consistent with historical patterns, the company anticipates 1Q22 revenues to be sequentially lower. The company experienced Omicron-related impacts during 1Q22 across its employee, production and supplier bases, causing temporary inefficiencies in operations, which have since subsided. In addition, the company anticipates 1Q22 will continue to be challenged by inflation, supply chain disruptions and component availability. As a result, gross margins are expected to be temporarily impacted. While the company has taken steps to mitigate higher input costs from freight and materials, the benefit of these actions is expected to lag the impact of cost changes. SG&A expense is expected to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half based on the timing of restructuring actions. The company also anticipates unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds due to changes in foreign currency rates compared to 2021.
Taken together, the company anticipates negative profitability for 1Q22, a decline compared to the prior year, ahead of sequential improvements for the balance of the year. As pricing and restructuring actions become effective, the company anticipates profit and cash flow to improve sequentially for the last three quarters of the year.
The company has historically had negative free cash flow during the first half of the year due to a confluence of company and industry seasonal patterns. This pattern is expected to continue due to the timing of annual payments such as customer rebates, higher working capital usage from seasonal inventory increases, and decreases in accounts payable. The absence of these payments in other parts of the year along with seasonally stronger sales in the second half of the year, and the benefits of the anticipated restructuring and cost mitigation actions are expected to drive more favorable free cash flow performance in the second half of the year. The company will continue to
manage working capital and the balance sheet to support normal operating needs and to fund restructuring actions. The company anticipates spending approximately $20 million on capital expenditures in 2022.
Favorable Long-term Demand
Ultimately, demand for the company's products and services is based on the need to provide care for people with certain conditions. The company's medical devices provide solutions for end-users and caregivers. Therefore, the demand for the company's medical equipment is largely driven by population growth and the incidence of certain conditions where treatment may be supplemented by the company's devices. The company also provides solutions to help equipment providers and residential care operators deliver cost-effective and high-quality care. The company believes that its commercial team, customer relationships, products and solutions, supply chain infrastructure, and strong research and development pipeline will create favorable business potential.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NET SALES
2021 Versus 2020
The table above provides net sales change as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation and divestitures (constant currency net sales). “Constant currency net sales" is a non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial measure, which is defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and divestitures. The current year's functional currency net sales are translated using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. These amounts are then compared to the prior year's sales to calculate the constant currency net sales change. For the divestiture impact, the company adjusted the net sales of the Dynamic Controls business which was divested as of March 7, 2020. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the core operating performance of the company.
Consolidated reported net sales for 2021 increased 2.6% for the year, to $872,457,000 from $850,689,000 in 2020. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by 3.7 percentage points with the divestiture decreasing net sales by 0.3 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 0.8% compared to 2020 driven by declines in lifestyle products offset by growth in respiratory and mobility and seating products. Both mobility and seating and lifestyle product categories continue to be impacted by restrictions which limited customer and end-user access to certain product selections. All products were also impacted by component shortages influenced by the supply chain challenges.
Europe - European reported net sales increased 6.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 to $499,118,000 from $468,041,000 as foreign currency translation increased net sales by 5.8 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 0.8% compared to 2020 driven by lifestyle products and mobility and seating products partially offset by respiratory products. Lifestyle product growth was helped by the company's decision to invest in inventory given the longer-supply chain related to these products.
Mobility and seating products benefiting from improved access to healthcare and easing of public health restrictions across Europe starting in the second half of 2021. Respiratory products were limited by component shortages from global supply challenges. The countries which the company has a significant portion of the operations are France, Germany, UK and the Nordic countries. Changes in exchange rates have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.
North America - North America reported net sales decreased 2.1% in 2021 versus the prior year to $340,980,000 from $348,307,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 0.5 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased, driven by a 10.7% reduction in lifestyle products, which more than offset respiratory improvement of 11.7%. Mobility and seating products were flat. Lifestyle product sales continued to be impacted by supply chain challenges as well as the enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation launched in 4Q21. We successfully launched our new ERP for all of our lifestyle products, however, this temporarily impacted the timing of order fulfillment as we manually reviewed all transactions and shipments processed in the new system for accuracy. While demand for mobility and seating products continued to be impacted by pandemic-related restrictions limiting access to healthcare professionals and institutions, reported net sales were flat compared to 2020 with sequential and year over year growth in the second half of 2021.
All Other - Reported net sales, which relate entirely to the Asia Pacific region, decreased 5.8% in 2021 from the prior year to $32,359,000 from $34,341,000. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by 7.4 percentage points and the impact of the Dynamic Controls divestiture in 2020 decreased net sales by 8.2 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 5.0% compared to 2020 primarily due to lack of timely arrival of inventory in
major markets. Changes in exchange rates have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in the Asia Pacific region.
The sales mix shift in 2021 from 2020 reflects some return to access to healthcare professionals but the pandemic continued to limit the access to healthcare professionals and institutions needed for certain product selections, specifically mobility and seating and non-bed lifestyle products as well as higher demand for pandemic related respiratory and bed and mattress products. In
addition, all product categories were impacted by component shortages from global supply chain challenges.
2020 Versus 2019
Consolidated net sales for 2020 decreased 8.3% for the year, to $850,689,000 from $927,964,000 in 2019. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by 0.4 percentage points with the divestiture decreasing net sales by 1.5 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 7.2% compared to 2019 as mobility and seating declined by $60,432,000, or 15.6% and lifestyle products declined by $28,520,000 or 6.6%. Both of these product categories were negatively impacted by the pandemic as a result of restrictions which limited access to certain product selections. These were partially offset by increases for respiratory products of $26,168,000 or 36.1%.
Europe - European net sales decreased 12.2% in 2020 compared to 2019 to $468,041,000 from $533,048,000 as foreign currency translation increased net sales by 0.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 12.8% compared to 2019 driven by a 18.3% decrease in sales of mobility and seating products and 8.8% decrease in sales of lifestyle products. Net sales were significantly impacted by the pandemic and by public health restrictions in certain countries limiting access to healthcare professionals and institutions needed for certain product selections.
North America - North America net sales were flat in 2020 versus the prior year to $348,307,000 from $348,201,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 0.1 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased, driven by higher sales of respiratory products of $20,688,000 or 40.1%, which offset declines in mobility and seating and lifestyle products. Demand for mobility and seating and non-bed lifestyle products were impacted by the pandemic, with public restrictions limiting access to healthcare professionals and institutions to provide certain products.
All Other - Net sales, which relate entirely to the Asia Pacific region, decreased 26.5% in 2020 from the prior year to $34,341,000 from $46,715,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 2.6 percentage points and the Dynamic Controls divestiture in 2020 decreased net sales by 29.2 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 5.3% compared to 2019 primarily from net sales increases in lifestyle products of 21.7%, primarily bed and bed related products.
GROSS PROFIT
2021 Versus 2020
Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 140 basis points to 27.4% in 2021 as compared to 28.8% in 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined significantly for North America while Europe and All Other margins declined slightly. Gross profit was significantly impacted by higher input costs of material, freight and labor from supply chain challenges impacting all regions. This was partially offset by favorable product mix.
Europe - Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points in 2021 compared to the prior year and gross profit dollars increased by $9,315,000. The increase in gross profit dollars was principally due to higher sales but margins were burdened significantly by increased freight and material costs stemming from global supply chain challenges. In addition, given the supply disruptions, operations costs were also unfavorable.
North America - Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 170 basis points in 2021 compared to the prior year while gross margin dollars decreased by $14,152,000. The decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily due to higher material and freight costs impacted by supply chain challenges, and reduced sales.
All Other - Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, decreased 30 basis points in 2021 compared to the prior year and gross profit dollars decreased $1,309,000. All other primarily relates to the company's Asia Pacific businesses. The decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily driven by reduced sales in the distribution business given untimely arrival of inventory in the region, and from the divestiture of the Dynamic Controls business as of March 7, 2020.
Research and Development
The company continued to invest strategically in research and development activities in 2021. The company dedicated funds to applied research activities to ensure that new and enhanced design concepts are available to its businesses. Research and development expenditures, which are included in costs of products sold, decreased to $8,656,000 in 2021 from $12,275,000 in 2020. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.0% and 1.4% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decline in expense in 2021 was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of Dynamic Controls.
2020 Versus 2019
Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 60 basis points to 28.8% in 2020 as compared to 28.2% in 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved significantly for North America and All Other, while Europe margins declined significantly impacted by the pandemic. Gross profit dollars decreased due to lower net sales in 2020, primarily in Europe.
Europe - Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points in 2020 compared to the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased by $22,951,000. The decrease in margin dollars was principally due to lower sales as result of the pandemic and unfavorable manufacturing variances on lower volume.
North America - Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 260 basis points in 2020 compared to the prior year while gross margin dollars increased by $11,133,000. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to favorable material costs, improved product mix and lower freight costs offset by unfavorable operational variances.
All Other - Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, increased 610 basis points in 2020 compared to the prior year and gross profit dollars decreased $4,997,000. All other primarily relates to the company's Asia Pacific businesses. The decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily driven by reduced sales from the divestiture of the Dynamic Controls business as of Mach 7, 2020.
Research and Development
The company continued to invest strategically in research and development activities in 2020. The company dedicated funds to applied research activities to ensure that new and enhanced design concepts are available to its businesses. Research and development expenditures, which are included in costs of products sold, decreased to $12,275,000 in 2020 from $15,836,000 in 2019. The decline in expense in 2020 was primarily related to the divestiture of Dynamic Controls. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.4% and 1.7% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
2021 Versus 2020
The table above provides selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense change as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant currency SG&A). “Constant currency SG&A" is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as SG&A expenses excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and divestitures. The current year's functional currency SG&A expenses are translated using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. These amounts are then compared to the prior year's SG&A expenses to calculate the constant currency SG&A expense change. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the core operating performance of the company.
The divestiture impact is related to the SG&A expenses related to the Dynamic Controls business divested on March 7, 2020.
Consolidated SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in 2021 and 27.8% in 2020. The overall dollar decrease was $4,115,000, or 1.7%, with foreign currency translation increasing expense by $7,583,000. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestiture of Dynamic Controls, SG&A expenses decreased $10,872,000, or 4.6%, primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
Europe - European SG&A expenses decreased by 1.6%, or $1,772,000, in 2021 compared to 2020. Foreign currency translation increased expense by approximately $6,127,000 or 5.6%. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased by $7,899,000, or 7.2%, primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
North America - SG&A expenses for North America decreased 3.0%, or $2,775,000, in 2021 compared to 2020 with foreign currency translation increasing expense by $691,000 or 0.6%. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $3,466,000, or 3.8%, driven primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
All Other - SG&A expenses increased $432,000 in 2021 compared to 2020. Foreign currency translation increased expense by $765,000. All Other includes SG&A related to the Asia Pacific businesses and non-allocated corporate costs.
SG&A expenses related to non-allocated corporate costs for 2021 decreased 13.9%, or $3,747,000, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs, including stock compensation. Stock compensation was lower in 2021 due to lowered projected vesting assumptions on multi-year cycle performance awards.
Related to the Asia Pacific businesses, 2021 SG&A increased 52.9%, or $4,179,000, compared to 2020 with foreign currency translation increasing SG&A expenses $765,000. The divestiture of Dynamic Controls decreased expense by $826,000 or 10.5%. Constant currency SG&A expenses increased $4,240,000, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange transactions.
2020 Versus 2019
Consolidated SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.8% in 2020 and 28.0% in 2019. The overall dollar decrease was $23,704,000, or 9.1%, with foreign currency translation increasing expense by $1,756,000. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestiture of Dynamic Controls in 2020, SG&A expenses decreased $21,976,000, or 8.6%, primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
Europe - European SG&A expenses decreased by 7.9%, or $9,459,000, in 2020 compared to 2019. Foreign currency translation increased expense by approximately $1,775,000 or 1.5%. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased by $11,234,000, or 9.4%, primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
North America - SG&A expenses for North America decreased 6.1%, or $5,909,000, in 2020 compared to 2019 with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $132,000 or 0.2%. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $5,777,000, or 5.9%, driven primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
All Other - SG&A expenses decreased $8,336,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. Foreign currency translation increased expense by $113,000. All Other includes SG&A related to the Asia Pacific businesses and non-allocated corporate costs.
SG&A expenses related to non-allocated corporate costs for 2020 decreased 7.4%, or $2,137,000, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs, primarily stock compensation. Stock compensation was lower in 2020 due to lowered projected vesting assumptions on multi-year cycle performance awards impacted by the pandemic and was partially offset by modification of performance awards in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Related to the Asia Pacific businesses, 2020 SG&A decreased 44.0%, or $6,199,000, compared to 2019 with foreign currency translation increasing SG&A expenses $113,000, or 7.4%. The divestiture of Dynamic Controls decreased expense by $3,484,000 or 24.7%. Constant currency SG&A expenses decreased $2,828,000, or 26.7%, primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs.
OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
2021 Versus 2020
Consolidated operating loss increased by $35,561,000 to $24,234,000 in 2021 as compared to operating income of $11,327,000 in 2020 primarily due to non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $28,564,000 in North America in 2021 (the result of changes in operating structure of the business following the recent IT implementation) and gain on sale of Dynamic Controls of $9,790,000 in 2020, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs of $4,824,000. Consolidated operating loss excluding goodwill impairment charge, gain on sale of business and restructuring costs declined by $2,031,000. This decline was primarily driven by higher input costs for material, freight and labor, influenced by the global supply chain challenges.
Europe - Operating income increased by $11,087,000 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily related to higher gross profit on higher sales and a smaller benefit from reduced SG&A expenses partially offset by higher freight costs.
North America - Operating income (loss) decreased by $11,377,000 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven primarily by decreased gross profit impacted by higher input costs and lower sales partially offset by reduced SG&A expenses.
All Other - Operating loss increased by $1,741,000 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by higher SG&A expenses in the Asia Pacific business and lower sales.
Charge Related to Restructuring Activities
The company's restructuring charges were originally necessitated primarily by continued declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement by the U.S. government, as well as similar healthcare reimbursement pressures abroad, which negatively affect the company's customers (e.g. home health care providers) and continued pricing
pressures faced by the company due to the outsourcing by competitors to lower cost locations. Restructuring decisions were also the result of reduced profitability in each of the segments. In addition, as a result of the company's business improvement strategy, additional restructuring actions continued in 2021. The company expects reduced salary and benefit costs principally impacting Selling, General and Administrative expenses and Cost of Products Sold.
Charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $2,534,000 which were related to Europe ($1,560,000), North America ($964,000) and All Other ($10,000). The European charges incurred related to severance ($886,000) and lease termination costs ($674,000). In North America and All other, all charges incurred were related to severance. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,305,000 and the cash payments were funded with company's cash on hand. The majority of the 2021 accrued balances are expected to be paid out within twelve months.
Charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $7,358,000 which were related to Europe ($5,934,000), North America ($1,306,000) and All Other ($118,000). The European charges incurred related to severance ($5,588,000) and lease termination costs ($346,000) primarily related to the German facility consolidation. In North America and All Other, all charges incurred were related to severance. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $8,132,000 and the cash payments were funded with company's cash on hand.
To date, the company's liquidity has been sufficient to absorb these charges; however, the company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. Refer also to "Charges Related to Restructuring Activities" in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
2020 Versus 2019
Consolidated operating income increased by $21,737,000 to $11,327,000 in 2020 from an operating loss of $10,410,000 in 2019 primarily due to a $23,704,000 decrease in SG&A expenses, principally attributable to lower employment costs, gain on sale of Dynamic Controls of $9,790,000 and decrease in restructuring costs of $4,471,000, which more than offset lower gross profit on lower sales, primarily impacted by the pandemic.
Europe - Operating income decreased by $13,492,000 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily related to lower gross profit on lower sales and unfavorable manufacturing variances, partially offset by reduced SG&A expenses, primarily driven by reduced employee-related costs. This segment was significantly impacted by the pandemic.
North America - Operating income increased by $17,041,000 in 2020 compared to 2019 driven primarily by lower SG&A expenses, due to decreased employee-related costs, as well as improved gross margin driven by product mix and cost reductions.
All Other - Operating loss improved in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by decreased SG&A expense driven by reduced employee-related costs, primarily stock compensation expense, and improved profitability in the Asia Pacific business.

Impairment of Intangible Asset
In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the company assesses intangible assets for impairment. As a result of the company's 2020 and 2019 intangible asset impairment assessments, the company recognized no impairment on intangible assets for 2020 as compared to $587,000 ($435,000 after-tax) impairment in 2019 related to a trademark with an indefinite life in the Industrial Products Group reporting unit, which is part of the North America segment. The fair value of trademarks were calculated using a relief from royalty payment methodology which requires applying an estimated market royalty rate to forecasted net sales and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value.
OTHER ITEMS
2021 Versus 2020
Impairment of goodwill
During the third quarter of 2021, the company's reporting units of North America / HME and Institutional Products Group were merged into one reporting unit of North America, consistent with the operating segment. Developments in the third quarter of 2021 and the completion of the reporting units merger were tied most closely to the actions of the company to implement components of a new ERP system which both changes the level of discrete financial information readily available and the go-forward manner in which the company assesses performance and allocates resources to the North America operating segment.
The reporting unit change within the North America operating segment in the third quarter of 2021 was a triggering event and required the company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on the interim goodwill impairment test, the company concluded the carrying value of the North America reporting unit was above its fair value. That conclusion resulted in the recording of impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of 2021 of $28,564,000.
As a result of the goodwill impairment, the company recorded a reversal of deferred taxes related to the tax deductible goodwill previously deducted by the company, resulting in the company recognizing a tax benefit of $661,000.
Loss (gain) on debt extinguishment including debt finance changes and fees
During the first quarter of 2021, the company repurchased and retired, at par plus accrued interest, $78,850,000 of its 2022 Notes. The result of the transaction was a loss on debt extinguishment including debt and finance fees of $709,000. During the third quarter of 2021, the company applied for forgiveness of its Cares Act loan along with its accrued interest. The company received
notification of approval of its debt forgiveness including accrued interest, in full, and the company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $10,131,000. These transactions resulted in a combined gain on debt extinguishment including debt and finance fees of $9,422,000.
During the second quarter of 2020, the company entered into separate, privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 5.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 ("2021 Notes") and certain holders of its 2022 Notes to exchange $35,375,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes and $38,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, for aggregate consideration of $73,875,000 in aggregate principal amount of new Series II 2024 Notes of the company and $5,593,000 in cash. During the third quarter of 2020, the company repurchased and retired $24,466,000 its 2021 Notes. These transactions resulted in a combined gain on debt extinguishment including debt and finance fees of $7,360,000.
Interest
Interest expense declined as a result the adoption of ASU 2020-06 which eliminated interest expense from convertible debt discount amortization effective January 1, 2021 offset by accretion from the Series II 2024 Notes which commenced in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to "Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of ASU 2020-06 adoption.
Income Taxes
The company had an effective tax rate charge of 16.5% and 15.7% on losses before taxes in 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to an expected benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% on the pre-tax losses for each period, respectively. The company's effective tax rate in 2021 and 2020 was unfavorable compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate expected benefit, principally due to the negative impact of the company's inability to record tax benefits related to the significant losses in countries which had tax valuation allowances. The gain on the divestiture of Dynamic Controls in 2020 was not taxable locally. In addition, the company had accrued withholding taxes on earnings of its Chinese subsidiary based on the expectation of not permanently reinvesting those earnings. The sale of this entity, without such distribution resulted in the reversal
of this accrual in an amount of $988,000 in 2020. The 2021 and 2020 effective tax rate was increased by certain taxes outside the United States, excluding countries with tax valuation allowances, that were at an effective rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate.
2020 Versus 2019
Net Gain on Convertible Debt Derivatives
The company recognized a net gain of $0 in 2020 compared to a net gain of $1,197,000 in 2019 related to the fair value of convertible debt derivatives. As a result of the company's receipt of shareholder approval authorizing the company to elect to settle future conversions of its convertible notes in common shares, the second quarter of 2019 was the last quarter for which the company could recognize gain (or loss) on the fair value of its note hedge assets and convertible debt conversion liabilities. Refer to "Long-Term Debt" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.
Loss on debt extinguishment including debt finance changes and fees
During the second quarter of 2020, the company entered into separate, privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2021 Notes and certain holders of its 2022 Notes to exchange $35,375,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes and $38,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, for aggregate consideration of $73,875,000 in aggregate principal amount of new Series II 2024 Notes of the company and $5,593,000 in cash. During the third quarter of 2020, the company repurchased and retired $24,466,000 its 2021 Notes. These transactions resulted in a combined loss on debt extinguishment including debt and finance fees of $7,360,000.
In the third quarter of 2019, the company repurchased $16,000,000 in principal amount of the 2021 Notes and in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into
separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2021 Notes to exchange $72,909,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, for aggregate consideration of $72,909,000 in aggregate principal amount of new Series I 2024 Notes of the company and approximately $6,928,000 in cash. These transactions resulted in a combined loss on debt extinguishment including debt and finance fees of $6,165,000.
Interest
Interest expense did not materially change in 2020 compared to 2019.
Income Taxes
The company had an effective tax rate charge of 15.7% and 21.1% on losses before taxes in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to an expected benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% on the pre-tax losses for each period, respectively. The company's effective tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was unfavorable compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate expected benefit, principally due to the negative impact of the company's inability to record tax benefits related to the significant losses in countries which had tax valuation allowances. The gain on the divestiture of Dynamic Controls was not taxable locally. In addition, the company had accrued withholding taxes on earnings of its Chinese subsidiary based on the expectation of not permanently reinvesting those earnings. The sale of this entity, without such distribution resulted in the reversal of this accrual in an amount of $988,000 in 2020. The 2020 and 2019 effective tax rates were increased by certain taxes outside the United States, excluding countries with tax valuation allowances, that were at an effective rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position through its cash balances and unused bank lines of credit (refer to Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report) as described below.
Key balances on the company's balance sheet and related metrics:
(1) Current assets less current liabilities.
(2) Long-term debt and Total debt include finance leases but exclude debt issuance costs recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability and debt discounts classified as debt or equity and operating leases.
(3) 2021 reflects the adoption of ASU 2020-06 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options" on January 1, 2021 which reduced total shareholders' equity by $25,128,000 and purchase of capped calls, related to the 2026 Notes issued in the first quarter of 2021, also reduced total stockholders' equity by $18,787,000.
(4) Reflects the combined availability of the company's North American and European asset-based revolving credit facilities before borrowings. The change in borrowing availability is due to changes in the calculated borrowing base. At December 31, 2021, the company had drawn $22,150,000 on the North American credit facility and $13,352,000 on the European credit facility. Outstanding borrowings and availability are calculated on a month lag related to the European credit facility.
The company's cash and cash equivalents were $83,745,000 and $105,298,000 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash balances at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is attributable to cash used for continued investment in the company's business improvement strategy and debt related payments.
Refer to "Long-Term Debt" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements included in this report for a summary of the material terms of the company's long-term indebtedness.
Debt repayments, acquisitions, divestitures, the timing of vendor payments, the timing of customer rebate payments, the granting of extended payment terms to significant national accounts and other activity can have a significant impact on the company's cash flow and borrowings outstanding such that the cash reported at the end of a given period may be materially different than cash levels during a given period. While the company has cash balances in various jurisdictions around the world, there are no material restrictions regarding the use of such cash for dividends within the company, loans or other purposes.
The company's total debt outstanding, inclusive of the debt discount related to the debentures included in equity as well as the debt discount and fees associated with the
company's convertible senior notes due 2022 ("2022 Notes") 2024 ("Series I 2024 Notes" and "Series II 2024 Notes") and 2026 ("2026 Notes") and finance leases, increased by $42,658,000 to $382,586,000 at December 31, 2021 from $339,928,000 as of December 31, 2020. The increase is driven the adoption of ASU 2020-06, issuance of $125,000,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes and additional credit facilities borrowings, offset by repayment of $1,250,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes, repurchase of $78,850,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes and forgiveness of $10,000,000 for the company's previously outstanding CARES Act loan.
The debt discount and fees associated with the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, Series I 2024 Notes, Series II 2024 Notes and 2026 notes reduced the company's reported debt balance by $7,712,000 and $28,333,000 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021 the company had drawn $22,150,000 on the North American credit facility and $13,352,000 on the European credit facility. At December 31, 2020, the company had drawn $20,000,000 on the North American credit facility and $11,502,000 on the European credit facility.
In addition, the company may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing existing debt restrict the company's
ability to incur additional debt (including secured debt), such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications and such restrictions and qualifications may be waived or amended, and debt (including secured debt) incurred in compliance with such restrictions and qualifications (as they may be waived or amended) may be substantial.
The company may from time to time seek to repay or purchase, exchange or otherwise retire its convertible notes or other debt obligations, in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, pursuant to the term of debt or otherwise. The company may also incur additional debt (including secured debt) to fund such transactions, refinance or restructure existing debt and/or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations or equity or equity-like securities. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, trading prices of debt from time to time, the company's liquidity requirements and cash position, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. The company cannot provide any assurance as to if or when it will consummate any such transactions or the terms of any such transactions.
The company has an asset-based lending Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a revolving line of credit, letter of credit and swing line facility for the company's U.S. and Canadian borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $60,000,000 (the "U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility") and a similar facility for European borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30,000,000 (the "European Credit Facility") each of which is subject to variable rates and availability based on a borrowing base formula.
As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2021 under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $38,979,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $26,644,000, taking into account the $3,000,000 minimum availability reserve, then-outstanding applicable letters of credit and other reserves of $2,585,000, and the $6,750,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the European borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2021 under the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $21,576,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $15,201,000, considering the $3,000,000 minimum availability reserve and the $3,375,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As of December 31, 2021, the combined aggregate borrowing availability under the U.S.
and Canadian Credit Facility and the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was $41,845,000.
As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the company incurred fees which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through January 16, 2024 of which $788,000 are yet to be amortized as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including dominion triggers requiring the company to maintain borrowing capacity of not less than $6,750,000 on any given business day or for five consecutive days related to the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, and $3,750,000 on any given business day or $3,375,000 for five consecutive days related to European borrowers, in order to avoid triggering full control by an agent for the lenders of the company's cash receipts for application to the company's obligations under the agreement.
If the company is unable to comply with the provisions in the Credit Agreement or agreements governing other current or future debt, it could result in a default, which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the Credit Agreement or other debt obligations could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness.
Based on the company's current expectations, the company believes that its cash balances and available borrowing capacity under its Credit Agreement and other borrowings or incurrences of debt should be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital requirements, and commitments for at least the next twelve months. Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decrease as the result of pressures on the business due to, for example, prolonged, or worsening of, negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued supply chain challenges, inflationary economic conditions, currency fluctuations or regulatory issues or the company's failure to execute its business plans or if the company's business improvement actions take longer than expected to materialize or development of one or more of the other risks discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the company may require additional financing, or may be unable to comply with its obligations under the credit facilities or its other obligations, and its lenders or creditors could demand repayment of any amounts outstanding. If additional financing is required, there can be no assurance
that it will be available on terms satisfactory to the company, if at all. The company also may evaluate and implement changes to its strategic goals and business plans, which may involve restructuring of its operations. If undertaken, any such restructuring may be substantial and involve significant effort and expense, and the company can make no assurances that such efforts, if undertaken, would be successful and result in improvements to the company business performance and financial condition. Refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a further discussion of risks applicable to the company's liquidity, capital resources and financial condition.
In the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes in a private offering which were to bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year payable semi-annually. At December 31, 2020, outstanding principal on 2021 Notes was $1,250,000 which was paid in 2021 at maturity on February 16, 2021. Prior to August 15, 2020, the 2021 Notes were convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
In the second quarter of 2017, the company issued $120,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes in a private offering which bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually and will mature in June 2022, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to December 1, 2021, the 2022 Notes were convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The net proceeds from the offering of the 2022 Notes were approximately $115,289,000, after deducting fees and offering expenses of $4,711,000. These debt issuance costs were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through June 2022 (net of loss on extinguishment of debt from 2020 transactions as discussed herein) of which $8,000 have yet to be amortized as of December 31, 2021. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering were used to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to the company from the warrant transactions), which was a net cost of $10,680,000. At December 31, 2021, $2,650,000 in principal amount of 2022 Notes remained outstanding.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2021 Notes to exchange $72,909,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, for aggregate consideration of $72,909,000 in aggregate principal amount of new Series I 2024 Notes of the company and approximately $6,928,000 in cash. The Series I 2024 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per year payable
semi-annually and will mature in November 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to May 2024, the Series I 2024 Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to maturity, the Series I 2024 Notes will be redeemable by the company upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods. The fees paid totaled $1,394,000. These debt issuance costs were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through November 2024 of which $769,000 have yet to be amortized as of December 31, 2021.
In the second quarter of 2020, the company entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes to exchange $35,375,000 in aggregate principal amount of the company's 2021 Notes and $38,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of the company's 2022 Notes, for $73,875,000 in aggregate principal amount of new Series II 2024 Notes and approximately $5,593,000 in cash. The new Series II 2024 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5% per year payable semi-annually and will mature in November 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to May 2024, the Series II 2024 Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to maturity, the Series II 2024 Notes will be redeemable by the company upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods. The principal amount of the Series II 2024 Notes also will accrete at a rate of approximately 4.7% compounding on a semi-annual basis. The accreted portion of the principal is payable in cash upon maturity but does not bear interest and is not convertible into the company's common shares. The amount accreted as of December 31, 2021 was $5,347,000. The issuance costs were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through November 2024 of which $971,000 have yet to be amortized as of December 31, 2021. The fees paid in 2020 totaled $1,505,000. A loss on debt extinguishment of $6,599,000 was recorded as part of the exchange transaction, which included the write-off of fees related to portions of the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes exchanged.
In the third quarter of 2020, the company repurchased $24,466,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2021 Notes, resulting in a $761,000 loss on debt extinguishment.
In the first quarter of 2021, the company issued $125,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in a private offering.
The notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25% per year payable semi-annually and mature in March 2026, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to September 15, 2025, the 2026 Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The 2026 Notes may be settled in cash, the company’s common shares or a combination of cash and the company’s common shares, at the company’s election.
The company may not redeem the 2026 Notes prior to March 20, 2024. The company may, at its election, redeem for cash all or part of the 2026 Notes, on or after March 20, 2024, only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to certain limited exceptions).
Debt issuance costs of $7,305,000 were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through March 2026. Debt issuance costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, of which, $5,964,000 remained to be amortized at December 31, 2021.
In connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, the company entered into capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain option counterparties. The company used $18,787,000 of the net proceeds of the private offering of the 2026 Notes to pay the cost of the Capped Call Transactions with the offset recorded to additional paid-in-capital.
The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2026 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the company’s common shares, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, which is initially $10.57, corresponding to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the market price per company common share, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, which is initially $16.58 (subject to adjustments), there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions expire March 15, 2026, subject to earlier exercise. There were 125,000
capped call options related to the 2026 Notes outstanding on December 31, 2021.
The company has used, and intends to continue to use, the remaining net proceeds from the Series I 2024 Notes, Series II 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding portions of the company's ongoing turnaround and addressing potential risks and contingencies. The net proceeds have allowed the company to invest in new products, people, marketing initiatives and working capital to transform the business and pursue growth.
On May 15, 2020 the company entered into an unsecured loan agreement in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 pursuant to sections 1102 and 1106 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, "CARES," Act which was evidenced by a promissory note, dated May 13, 2020, and would bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.00%. This loan may be forgivable, partially or in full, if certain conditions are met, principally based on having been disbursed for permissible purposes and based on average levels of employment over a designated period of time. At the time of the loan, no assurance could be given that the company would be granted forgiveness of the loan in whole or in part.
In the third quarter of 2021, the company applied for forgiveness of the CARES Act debt along with its accrued interest. The company received notification of approval of its debt forgiveness inclusive of accrued interest, in full, and as a result, the company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $10,131,000.
The company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. (“DLL”), a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to the company's U.S. customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under its credit facilities could increase.
Should interest rates increase, the company expects that it would be able to absorb modest rate increases without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources. For 2021 and 2020, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings, excluding finance leases, was 4.5% and 4.6%, respectively.
Refer to "Long-Term Debt" and "Leases and Commitments" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the company's convertible notes and credit facilities and lease liabilities, respectively.
The company's contractual obligations primarily consist of debt, leases, product liability, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and a purchase obligation. Refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding these obligations. Regarding the purchase obligation, in October 2019, the company entered into an agreement to outsource substantially all of the company's information technology business service activities, including, among other things, support, rationalization and upgrading of the company's legacy information technology systems and implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system and eCommerce platform.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
There were no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The company estimates that capital investments for 2022 will be approximately $20,000,000 compared to actual capital expenditures of $17,698,000 in 2021. The continued investment at this level relates primarily to the new ERP system. The company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures (refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources"). The Credit Agreement limits the company's annual capital expenditures to $35,000,000.
DIVIDEND POLICY
On May 21, 2020, the Board of Directors decided to suspend the quarterly dividend on the company's Common Shares in light of the impacts of COVID-19 on the business. The Board of Directors suspended the company's regular quarterly dividend on the Class B Common Shares starting in the third quarter of 2018. Less than 4,000 Class B Common Shares remain outstanding and suspending the regular Class B dividend allows the company to save on the administrative costs and compliance expenses associated with that dividend. Holders of Class B Common Shares are entitled to convert their shares into Common Shares at any time on a share-for-share basis and would be eligible for any Common Share dividends declared following any such conversion.
CASH FLOWS
Cash flows used by operating activities of $14,309,000 in 2021 compared to cash provided of $21,917,000 in the previous year. The 2021 operating cash flows were burdened by investments in inventory and payments related to accrued expenses for VAT and other taxes deferred from 2020 and funding severance costs. These were partially offset by higher accounts payable levels, impacted by the higher inventory levels.
Cash flows used by investing activities were $17,802,000 in 2021, compared to $9,547,000 in 2020. The increase in cash flows used for investing was primarily driven by a benefit of $14,563,000 for proceeds from the sale of Dynamic Controls in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2021 were $12,873,000 compared to cash flow provided of $6,259,000 in 2020.
Cash flows provided in 2021 included the issuance of $125,000,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, payment of $5,369,000 in financing costs, purchase of capped calls related to the 2026 Notes for $18,787,000, repurchase of $78,850,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes and repayment of $1,250,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes. Borrowing on credit facilities are under the company's Credit Agreement which provides an asset-based-lending senior secured credit facilities.
Cash flows provided in 2020 was driven primarily by borrowing of $31,502,000 on the North America and Europe credit facility under the company's Credit Agreement as well as an unsecured CARES Act loan of $10,000,000. This was offset by cash paid of $24,466,000 to retire the majority of the company's outstanding 2021 Notes in the third quarter of 2020 and $7,098,000 of cash paid in connection with the exchange 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes for Series II 2024 Notes executed during the second quarter of 2020 for debt fees and payments to note holders.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure as follows:
Free cash flow usage was $31,974,000 in 2021 compared to inflow of $9,000 in 2020. The change in free cash flow was driven by the same items impacting operating activities noted previously. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure composed of net cash used by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating
the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments (including acquisitions, etc.).
In the third quarter of 2021, the company initiated accounts receivable factoring programs within the Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden and Denmark which benefited free cash flow by $7,082,000.
The company historically generates negative free cash flow during the first half of the year. This pattern is expected to continue due to the timing of annual one-time payments such as customer rebates earned during the prior year and higher working capital usage from inventory increases. In addition, for 2022, the company will continue to fund repayment of deferred VAT and other taxes from 2020, from government programs introduced as a result of the pandemic. The absence of these payments and seasonally stronger sales in the second half of the year typically result in more favorable free cash flow in the second half of the year.
The company's approximate cash conversion days at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are as follows:
Days in receivables are equal to current quarter net current receivables divided by trailing four quarters of net sales multiplied by 365 days. Days in inventory and accounts payable are equal to current quarter net inventory and accounts payable, respectively, divided by trailing four quarters of cost of sales multiplied by 365 days. Total cash conversion days are equal to days in receivables plus days in inventory less days in accounts payable.
The company invested in incremental inventory to mitigate challenges with supply chain disruptions. This also influences the accounts payable balances. The company provides a summary of days of cash conversion for the components of working capital, so investors may
see the rate at which cash is disbursed, collected and how quickly inventory is converted and sold.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Consolidated Financial Statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing the financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The company recognizes revenues when control of the product or service is transferred to unaffiliated customers. Revenues from Contracts with Customers, ASC 606, provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues. The company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with GAAP under ASC 606.
All of the company's product-related contracts, and a portion related to services, have a single performance obligation, which is the promise to transfer an individual good or service, with revenue recognized at a point in time. Certain service-related contracts contain multiple performance obligations that require the company to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. For such contracts, the company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price at inception of the contract. The company determined the standalone selling price based on the expected cost-plus margin methodology. Revenue related to the service contracts with multiple performance obligations is recognized over time. To the extent performance obligations are satisfied over time, the company defers revenue recognition until the performance obligations are satisfied.
The determination of when and how much revenue to recognize can require the use of significant judgment.
Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the company's products and services to the customer.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring the product or providing services. The amount of consideration received and recognized as revenue by the company can vary as a result of variable consideration terms included in the contracts such as customer rebates, cash discounts and return policies. Customer rebates and cash discounts are estimated based on the most likely amount principle and these estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Customers have the right to return product within the company's normal terms policy, and as such, the company estimates the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience. The company adjusts its estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration the company expects to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. The company generally does not expect that there will be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration (refer to Receivables in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements include elsewhere in this report).
Depending on the terms of the contract, the company may defer recognizing revenue until the end of a given period as the result of title transfer terms that are based upon delivery and or acceptance which align with transfer of control of the company's products to its customers.
Sales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is probable based upon a credit analysis, which may include obtaining a credit application, a signed security agreement, personal guarantee and/or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer. Credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and/or other relevant financial information. Existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts.
The company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections, delivery and returns. The company's payment terms are for relatively short periods and thus do not contain any element of financing. Additionally, no contract costs are incurred that would require capitalization and amortization.
Sales, value added, and other taxes the company collects concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold.
The majority of the company's warranties are considered assurance-type warranties and continue to be recognized as expense when the products are sold (refer to Current Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements include elsewhere in this report). These warranties cover against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. In addition, the company has sold extended warranties that, while immaterial, require the company to defer the revenue associated with those warranties until earned. The company has established procedures to appropriately defer such revenue. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accruals and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company's warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such as a product recall, which could require additional warranty reserve provisions. Refer to Accrued Expenses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management's evaluation of the financial condition of the customer. In addition, as a result of the third-party financing arrangement, management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company's limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed and general reserve for macroeconomic considerations.
The company continues to closely monitor the credit-worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes Medicare contract prices under its NCB program which includes 100% of the Medicare population. The company believes that the NCB program contract pricing could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which have a portion of their revenues tied to Medicare reimbursement. In addition, there is a risk that these precedent-setting price reductions could influence other
non-CMS payors' reimbursement rates for the same product categories. As a result, this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable.
The company has an agreement with DLL, a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to Invacare's U.S. customers. The DLL agreement provides for direct leasing between DLL and the Invacare customer. The company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts. The company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts.
Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets
Property, equipment, intangibles and certain other long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue. Under Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. The company's measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is October 1 and the analysis is completed in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, goodwill and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Most of the company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to the company's Europe reporting unit which was profitable in 2021.
To assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below. The company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments. To estimate the fair values of the reporting units, the company utilizes a discounted cash flow (DCF) method in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth, operating income, inventory turns, days' sales outstanding, etc. to forecast future cash flows. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for 20-year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the 20-year treasury rate for the risk-free rate, a market risk premium, the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment. The assumptions used are based on a market participant's point of view and yielded a WACC of 11.19% in 2021 for the company's impairment analyses for the reporting units with goodwill compared to 11.27% in 2020 and 11.88% in 2019. The financial forecast assumptions and WACC used have a significant impact
upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company's annual impairment testing as lower projections of operating income or a higher WACC decrease the fair value estimates.
The company also utilizes an Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their EV to EBITDA multiples adjusted by an estimated premium. While more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method, the EV to EBITDA method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results.
During the third quarter of 2021, the company's reporting units of North America / HME and Institutional Products Group merged into one reporting unit of North America, consistent with the operating segment. Developments in 2021 and the conclusion of the reporting units merger were tied mostly to actions of the company to implement components of a new ERP system which changes both the level of discrete financial information readily available and the go-forward manner in which the company assesses performance and allocates resources to the North America operating segment.
The reporting unit change within the North America operating segment in the third quarter of 2021 was a triggering event and required the company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on the interim goodwill impairment test, the company concluded that the carrying value of the North America reporting unit was above its fair value. That conclusion resulted in the recording of impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of 2021 of $28,564,000.
The company completed its interim test in the third quarter of 2021 consistent with the process of its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit could be below a reporting unit's fair value.
While there was no impairment in 2021 related to goodwill for the Europe, a future potential impairment is possible for Europe should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis or if business changes impact the company's assessment of reporting units. Furthermore, the company's valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the financial projections or market inputs used to determine the WACC change significantly. For instance, higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the WACC and thus increase the chance of impairment. In consideration of this potential, the company assessed the results if the WACC used were 100 basis points higher for the 2021 impairment
analyses and determined that there still would not be any impairment for the Europe reporting unit.
The company also considers the potential for impairment of other intangible assets and other long-lived assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment. In 2021 and 2020, the company performed an assessment for potential impairments and recognized no intangible asset impairment charge or other long-lived asset impairment charge. In 2019, the company performed an assessment for potential impairments and recognized an intangible asset impairment charge within the North America operating segment of $587,000 ($435,000 after-tax) related to a trademark with an indefinite life. The fair value of the trademark was calculated using a relief from royalty payment methodology which requires applying an estimated market royalty rate to forecasted net sales and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value.
The company's intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives. Defined-lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists and developed technology. The company's indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks.
The company evaluates the carrying value of definite-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Definite-lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group. Actual impairment amounts for definite-lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The company assesses indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Any impairment amounts for indefinite-lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset.
Product Liability
The company is essentially self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the
company's per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.
Product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices.
Warranty
Generally, the company's products are covered by assurance-type warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. In addition, the company has sold extended warranties that, while immaterial, require the company to defer the revenue associated with those warranties until earned. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company's warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such as a product recall, which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision. Refer to Accrued Expenses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.
Accounting for Stock Compensation
The company accounts for stock compensation under the provisions of Compensation-Stock Compensation, ASC 718. The company has not made any modifications to the terms of any previously granted awards (other than the modification in the fourth quarter of 2020 (refer to Equity
Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and no changes have been made regarding the valuation methodologies or assumptions used to determine the fair value of awards granted and the company continues to use a Black-Scholes valuation model to value options granted. As of December 31, 2021, there was $8,612,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock compensation arrangements, which is related to non-vested awards, and includes $6,866,000 related to restricted stock awards and $1,746,000 related to performance awards.
Most of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted without cost to the recipients are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Performance awards granted are expensed based on estimated achievement of the performance objectives over the relevant performance award periods.
Income Taxes
As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions. The process requires estimating the company's current tax liability, including assessing uncertainties related to tax return filing positions, as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies. The temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities. The company also must estimate whether it will more likely than not realize its deferred tax assets and whether a valuation allowance should be established. The company's deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance in the U.S., Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand. In the event that actual results differ from its estimates, the company's provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. The company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies.
Accounting for Convertible Debt and Related Derivatives
In 2016 and 2017, the company issued $150,000,000 and $120,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 and 2022 Notes, respectively. In 2019, the company repurchased $16,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes for cash and entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2021 Notes to exchange $72,909,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes for new 5.00% Convertible Senior Exchange Notes Series I due 2024 of the company and $6,928,000 in cash.
In 2020, the company repurchased $24,466,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes for cash and
entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2021 Notes to exchange $35,375,000 in aggregate principal amount of the company's 2021 Notes and certain holders of its 2022 Notes to its 2022 Notes to exchange $38,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of the company's 2022 Notes for new 5.00% Convertible Senior Exchange Notes Series II due 2024 of the company and $5,593,000 in cash. In connection with the original offering of the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain counterparties. These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Notes.
The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. The initial strike price of the warrants is $22.4175 and $21.4375 per share on the 2021 and 2022 Notes, respectively, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions.
As a result of the repurchase of 2021 Notes in third quarter of 2019 and the exchange of 2021 Notes for new notes in the fourth quarter of 2019, a partial unwind of the note hedge options and warrants entered into with the issuance of the 2021 Notes also occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019. Note hedge options outstanding were reduced from the original number of 300,000 to 138,182 and warrants were reduced from the initial number of 9,007,380 to 3,860,624. The partial unwind of the note hedge options and warrants resulted in no net impact to cash or paid in capital.
As a result of the repurchase of 2021 Notes in the third quarter of 2020 and the exchange of 2021 Notes for new notes in the second quarter of 2020, a partial unwind of the note hedge options and warrants entered into with the issuance of the 2021 Notes also occurred. Note hedge options outstanding were reduced from the original number of 300,000 to 62,341 and warrants were reduced from the initial number of 9,007,380 to 3,141,943. The partial unwind of the note hedge options and warrants resulted in no net impact to cash or paid in capital.
The convertible debt conversion liabilities and the convertible note hedges were accounted for as derivatives and accounted for at fair value quarterly until no longer accounted for separately as a result of obtaining shareholder approval in May 2019 to settle the Notes with common shares. The warrants are included as equity. The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liabilities and the convertible note hedges were estimated using a lattice model incorporating the terms and conditions of the notes and considering, for example, changes in the prices of the company's common shares, company stock price volatility, risk-free rates and changes in market rates. The valuations were, among other things, subject to changes in both the company's credit worthiness and the counter-parties to the instruments as well as change in general market conditions.
The company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in the removal of convertible debt discounts of $25,218,000, adjustment of $34,798,000 to additional paid-in-capital and $9,670,000 adjustment to retained earnings. Convertible debt discounts prior to adoption of ASU 2020-06 were amortized over the convertible debt term through interest expense. Subsequent to adoption, convertible debt discounts are not applicable when accounting for debt as a single unit of account. Interest expense for 2020 and 2019 related to debt discount amortization (which was not recognized in 2021 due to adoption) were $9,673,000 or $0.28 per basic and diluted share and $12,325,000 or $0.37 per basic and diluted share, respectively. There was no impact of adoption on performance metrics used for short-term or long-term incentive compensation. Accretion specific to the Series II 2024 Notes was unaffected by adoption. Due to the valuation allowance, there was no net impact to income taxes for the adoption. Subsequent to adoption weighted average shares when calculating diluted earnings per share requires the application of the if-converted method for all convertible instruments.
