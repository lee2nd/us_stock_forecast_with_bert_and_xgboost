Business Environment
Index
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The pandemic has significantly impacted our business over the past two fiscal years. The initial effects of the pandemic included mass closings of parts of the national and global economy, supply chain disruptions and stay-at-home orders, all of which impacted every aspect of our business in Fiscal 2021. Throughout this challenging time, we were able to navigate a rapidly changing retail landscape by leveraging omni-channel and distribution capabilities, having access to and availability of in-demand products, taking decisive action to protect liquidity, demonstrating the ability to reopen stores quickly when circumstances allowed and servicing our customers efficiently and safely through new shopping and payment initiatives. Government stimulus and unemployment programs boosted discretionary spending and consumer demand for the products we carry, resulting in significant sales growth and improved profitability.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continued into Fiscal 2022, communities and consumers remained focused on health and safety protocols and supply chain challenges persisted, but additional government stimulus and extended unemployment benefits continued to fuel discretionary spending and consumer demand. Toward the end of Fiscal 2022, ongoing supply chain disruptions impacted our overall inventory position and had a negative impact on fourth quarter revenue and profitability. In addition, the lack of government stimulus in comparison to the prior year coupled with inflation appears to have driven slightly more conservative consumer purchasing behavior. Despite these headwinds late in Fiscal 2022, the combination of health and safety initiatives we implemented early in the pandemic, changes in the distribution and availability of high demand footwear and apparel and investments we made to improve the consumer experience allowed us to capitalize on the strong demand cycle. These factors were the main contributors to the robust revenue and profitability growth we experienced in Fiscal 2022.
Executive Summary
Following is a highlight of our financial results over the last three fiscal years:
During Fiscal 2022, we opened 36 stores and closed seven stores, bringing the store base to 1,096 in 35 states as of January 29, 2022. Included in new stores and closed stores is one Sports Additions store rebranded and opened as a Hibbett store. During Fiscal 2021, we opened 28 stores and closed 42 stores. Included in new stores were 12 Hibbett stores rebranded and opened as City Gear stores. Included in closed stores in Fiscal 2021 were 10 Hibbett stores closed for rebranding to City Gear stores. Inventory on a per store basis increased 6.6% compared to Fiscal 2021 as we strove to normalize our inventory levels, despite continuing supply chain constraints.
Hibbett ended Fiscal 2022 with $17.1 million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet. Hibbett had no debt outstanding at January 29, 2022, and we had full availability of our $100.0 million 2021 Credit Facility.
In March 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million under our prior credit facilities as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Note with Regions Bank (the "Amended Credit Facility") that provided for an aggregate amount of credit available to us of $75.0 million. The Amended Credit Facility superseded the Regions Bank credit agreement dated October 2018 and terminated our Bank of America credit agreement dated October 2018. In July 2021, we entered into an unsecured 2021 Credit Facility between the Company and its subsidiaries and Regions Bank. The 2021 Credit Facility, which superseded the Amended Credit Facility, provides an unsecured line of credit of up to $100.0 million and is effective through July 2026 with an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.0% to 1.8%, depending on specified leverage levels. For discussion of our 2021 Credit Facility and other borrowings, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Index
For Fiscal 2022, total company-wide square footage increased 2.9%. To supplement new store openings, we continued to expand high performing stores, increasing the square footage by an average of 29.9% in 10 existing stores in Fiscal 2022.
In Fiscal 2022, comparable store sales increased 17.4%.
Comparable store sales - Stores deemed as comparable stores include our Hibbett, City Gear and Sports Additions stores open throughout the reporting period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, and e-commerce sales. We consider comparable store sales to be a key indicator of our current performance; measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Management believes that positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of operating costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to deleveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales and the level of cash flow. Comparable store sales for City Gear stores are presented in comparable store sales beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 and are in full year comparable store sales for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021.
For Fiscal 2022, 1,034 stores were included in comparable sales. If a store remodel, relocation, or expansion results in the store being closed for a significant period, its sales are removed from the comparable store sales base until it has been open a full 12 months. In addition, rebranded stores are treated as a new store and are not presented in comparable store sales until they have been open a full 12 months under the new brand.
About Non-GAAP Measures
This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020. We are not presenting any non-GAAP financial measures with respect to Fiscal 2022. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of our current financial results to historical operations and the financial results of peer companies, as they exclude the effects of items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operating results, such as expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2021, the acquisition and integration of City Gear in both Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, and our strategic realignment plan in Fiscal 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic include impairment charges of goodwill, tradename and other assets and net lower of cost or net realizable value (LCM) inventory reserve charges and were specific to Fiscal 2021. Costs related to acquisition and integration of City Gear include amortization of inventory step-up value, professional service fees and changes in the valuation of the contingent earnout. Costs related to the strategic realignment plan included lease and equipment impairment costs, third party liquidation fees, store exit costs and residual net lease costs.
While we use these non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our ability to assess certain aspects of our financial performance, our management does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial statements. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial statements, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated.
Note: Columns may not sum due to rounding.
Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021
Net sales. Net sales increased $271.5 million, or 19.1%, to $1.69 billion for Fiscal 2022 from $1.42 billion for Fiscal 2021. Furthermore:
•Comparable store net sales for Fiscal 2022 increased 17.4% compared to Fiscal 2021 primarily driven by continued strength in footwear, with notable growth in the women's and kids' categories, and sneaker-connected apparel and accessories. For Fiscal 2022, 1,034 stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison.
•Stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for $71.1 million of net sales.
•Brick and mortar comparable sales were up 21.4% while e-commerce sales decreased 1.6% compared to Fiscal 2021.
•We increased our overall store count by a net of 29 stores in Fiscal 2022.
Gross margin. Cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise, the related inbound and outbound freight expense, occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for our wholesale and logistics facility. Gross margin was $646.4 million, or 38.2% of net sales, in Fiscal 2022, compared with $504.5 million, or 35.5% of net sales, in Fiscal 2021. This is the result of historically high margin performance in the first half of Fiscal 2022, which was driven by higher sell-through, a low promotional environment and a greater mix of in-store sales, which carry a higher margin than e-commerce sales. Gross margin of $646.4 million, or 38.2% of net sales compares to non-GAAP gross margin of $507.5 million, or 35.8% of net sales in Fiscal 2021, adjusted for inventory reserve adjustments.
Store operating, selling and administrative (SG&A) expenses. SG&A expenses, including goodwill impairment in Fiscal 2021, were $382.4 million, or 22.6% of net sales, for Fiscal 2022, compared with $376.5 million, or 26.5% of net sales, for Fiscal 2021.
Excluding certain City Gear acquisition and integration expenses and pandemic related impairment and valuation costs that occurred in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2022 SG&A expenses of $382.4 million, or 22.6% of net sales, reflected an improvement, compared to $336.5 million, or 23.7% of net sales, for Fiscal 2021.
A large portion of the SG&A rate decrease resulted from leverage from year-over-year revenue growth.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was flat as a percentage of net sales for Fiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021. The increase in dollars year-over-year was primarily due to increased store development, infrastructure and technology projects placed in service in Fiscal 2022.
Index
Provision for income taxes. The combined federal, state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 23.5% for Fiscal 2022 and 24.2% for Fiscal 2021. The lower rate in Fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of additional equity compensation deductions in Fiscal 2022, resulting from the Company's increased common stock price.
Reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures. The following table provides a reconciliation of our consolidated statement of operations for the 52-weeks ended January 30, 2021, as reported on a GAAP basis, to a consolidated statement of operations for the same period prepared on a non-GAAP basis. For more information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see “Executive Summary - About Non-GAAP Measures” above.
GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
1) Excluded acquisition amounts during the 52-weeks ended January 30, 2021, related to the acquisition of City Gear, LLC, consist primarily of change in the valuation of contingent earnout and accounting and professional fees.
2) Excluded amounts during the 52-weeks ended January 30, 2021, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, consist primarily of net non-cash lower of cost and net realizable value charges in cost of goods sold and impairment costs (goodwill, tradename and other assets) in SG&A.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Net sales. Net sales increased $235.4 million, or 19.9%, to $1.42 billion for Fiscal 2021 from $1.18 billion for Fiscal 2020. Furthermore:
•Comparable store net sales for Fiscal 2021 increased 22.2% compared to Fiscal 2020 primarily driven by strength in men's, women's and kids' footwear coupled with increased volume in sneaker-connected apparel and accessories. These strengths were partially offset by softer sales in team sports. For Fiscal 2021, 1,015 stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison.
•Stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for $244.9 million of net sales.
•E-commerce sales increased 92.1% compared to Fiscal 2020.
•Increases were noted in both average ticket and items per transaction.
•We decreased our overall store count by a net of 14 stores in Fiscal 2021 primarily as the result of accelerated closure of underperforming stores in the fourth quarter.
Gross margin. Cost of goods sold included the cost of merchandise, occupancy costs for stores, occupancy and operating costs for our wholesale and logistics facility, and ship-to-home freight. Gross margin was $504.5 million, or 35.5% of net sales, in Fiscal 2021, compared with $383.5 million, or 32.4% of net sales, in Fiscal 2020. Excluding inventory reserve adjustments in Fiscal 2021 and City Gear acquisition and strategic realignment costs incurred in Fiscal 2020, non-GAAP gross margin was $507.5
million, or 35.8% of net sales in Fiscal 2021, compared to $383.3 million, or 32.4% in Fiscal 2020.
Index
Overall, GAAP gross margin improved by approximately 310 basis points as a percentage of net sales in comparison to Fiscal 2020 driven by higher sell through and leverage of store occupancy expenses. These impacts were slightly offset by a higher mix
of e-commerce sales, which carry a lower margin due to incremental shipping costs, and an increase in the LCM inventory
reserve. Logistics expenses were higher year over year in dollars, but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales. The
uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on inventory valuations contributed to a large increase in the LCM
inventory reserve in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Although aged inventory and the related reserve declined after the first quarter, there was still a net $3.0 million LCM expense impact in Fiscal 2021. This amount was excluded from the non-GAAP gross margin figure. Store occupancy costs decreased approximately 160 basis points as a percentage of net sales year over year due to leverage generated from increased sales revenue.
SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses, including goodwill impairment, were $376.5 million, or 26.5% of net sales, for Fiscal 2021, compared with $318.0 million, or 26.9% of net sales, for Fiscal 2020.
Excluding non-GAAP adjustments, SG&A expenses were $336.5 million, or 23.7% of net sales for Fiscal 2021, compared to
$298.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, for Fiscal 2020.
A large portion of the SG&A increase resulted from impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included non-cash
intangible asset impairments to goodwill in the amount of $19.7 million and the City Gear tradename of $8.9 million. Other
impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic included asset group impairments of approximately $4.1 million and other related
costs of $2.8 million.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales for Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020. The decrease was mainly due to leverage from higher net sales.
Provision for income taxes. The combined federal, state, and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 24.2% for Fiscal 2021 and 24.7% for Fiscal 2020. The lower rate in Fiscal 2021 was the result of executive compensation
deduction limitations in Fiscal 2020 and additional equity compensation deductions in Fiscal 2021 resulting from the
Company's increased stock price.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures. The following table provides a reconciliation of our consolidated statement of operations for the 52-weeks ended February 1, 2020, as reported on a GAAP basis, to a consolidated statement of operations for the same period prepared on a non-GAAP basis. For more information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see “Executive Summary - About Non-GAAP Measures” above.
GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
1) Excluded acquisition amounts during the 52-weeks ended February 1, 2020, related to the acquisition of City Gear, LLC, consist primarily of the amortization of inventory step-up in cost of goods sold and change in the valuation of contingent earnout, legal, accounting, and professional fees.
Index
2) Excluded amounts during the 52-weeks ended February 1, 2020, related to our strategic realignment plan, consist primarily of gain on operating leases net of accelerated amortization on right-of-use assets in cost of goods sold and professional fees, impairment costs, and loss on fixed assets in SG&A.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Analysis of Cash Flows
Our capital requirements relate primarily to funding capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, the maintenance of facilities and systems necessary to support company growth and working capital requirements. Our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Historically, we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under credit facilities. We use excess cash to offset bank fees.
We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from operations, funds available under the 2021 Credit Facility, operating and finance leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures. We are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity.
Our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):
Operating Activities.
Cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business. Typically, we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons, such as winter holidays, the spring sales period and late summer back-to-school shopping. Inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction, combined with proportionately higher net income, typically produces a positive cash flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.5 million for the 52-weeks ended January 29, 2022 compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $197.7 million and $92.3 million for the 52-weeks ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 was impacted by the following:
•Net income provided cash of $174.3 million, $74.3 million and $27.3 million during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.
•Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $35.8 million, $29.6 million and $29.3 million during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, and stock-based compensation expense of $5.5 million, $3.8 million and $2.7 million during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. Depreciation expense has increased in each fiscal year due to investments in new store development, infrastructure and information technology initiatives and due to accelerated depreciation taken in Fiscal 2020 resulting from increased store closures. Fluctuations in stock-based compensation generally result from the number of the equity eligible employees, achievement of performance-based equity awards at greater or lesser than their target level, fluctuations in the price of our common stock and levels of forfeitures in any given period.
•Other non-cash adjustments to net income for Fiscal 2022 included a $13.8 million decrease in the contingent earnout valuation related to City Gear when the earnout was paid. Other non-cash adjustments to net income for Fiscal 2021 included $37.1 million of asset impairment charges with the largest impact resulting from a significant temporary decrease in the market valuation of the Company at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a $1.3 million change in the valuation of the contingent earnout related to City Gear.
Index
•Ending inventory per store increased 6.6% and decreased 28.9% at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2022 inventory increased as we strove to normalize our inventory levels despite continuing supply chain constraints. Fiscal 2021 inventory decreased due to the significant lift in sales volume, supply chain constraints and proactive inventory management. The change in net inventory used cash of $19.2 million during Fiscal 2022, provided cash of $86.0 million during Fiscal 2021 and used cash of $8.7 million during Fiscal 2020.
•The change in accounts payable used cash of $25.6 million in Fiscal 2022, used cash of $26.3 million in Fiscal 2021 and provided cash of $24.3 million in Fiscal 2020. Changes are due mainly to the timing of payments in relation to inventory receipts, capital expenditures and SG&A spending.
Investing Activities.
Cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 totaled $70.2 million, $33.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively. Gross capital expenditures used $71.2 million, $34.8 million and $17.3 million during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures in all periods primarily consisted of new stores, relocations, remodels, expansions of existing stores and infrastructure projects.
We opened 36 new stores and expanded and/or relocated 16 additional existing stores during Fiscal 2022. We opened 28 new stores and expanded and/or relocated 15 additional existing stores during Fiscal 2021. We opened 24 new stores and expanded and/or relocated nine additional existing stores during Fiscal 2020.
Our anticipated capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending January 28, 2023, is approximately $60.0 million to $70.0 million, with the expenditures related to:
•Store development, including the opening of new stores and the remodeling, relocation or expansion of selected existing stores;
•Additional technology and infrastructure investments; and
•Other departmental needs for ongoing maintenance and support.
Financing Activities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $281.6 million in Fiscal 2022. Net cash used in financing activities was $21.5 million in Fiscal 2021 and net cash used in financing activities was $71.0 million in Fiscal 2020. Historically, the fluctuation in net financing activities between years is primarily the result of borrowing activity and repurchases of our common stock. In Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, net borrowings on our credit facilities were zero. In Fiscal 2020, we paid off $35.0 million in borrowings that carried over from Fiscal 2019. We expended $271.1 million, $17.6 million and $35.5 million on repurchases of our common stock during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, which included cash used to settle net share equity awards of $3.3 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.
Additionally, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 and the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, we paid $15.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, to the former members and warrant holders of City Gear for achievement of financial goals in the first- and second-year post acquisition. Of these amounts, $1.2 million and $4.8 million were reflected as financing activities in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively, and represent the fair value of the short-term portions of the contingent earnout booked through the purchase price allocation.
On August 25, 2021, the Board instituted a quarterly cash dividend program with the first cash dividend payment made on September 9, 2021, at $0.25 per share of common stock outstanding as of the record date. During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, we paid cash dividends of $10.9 million under two declarations; both at $0.25 per share of common stock outstanding as of the record date.
Financing activities also consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. As stock options are exercised and shares are purchased through our employee stock purchase plan, we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction; however, the amounts and timing cannot be predicted.
At January 29, 2022, we had one unsecured credit facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, with Regions Bank, which allows for borrowings up to $100.0 million and has an expiration date of July 9, 2026. The 2021 Credit Facility includes an annual commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears, in an amount between 15 and 20 basis points of the unused portion of the line of credit as determined on a daily basis, dependent on the amount of debt outstanding. In addition, the Company is subject to certain financial covenants which include:
• Advance limitation of 55% of the net book value of the Company's inventory;
Index
• A Consolidated Lease-Adjusted Leverage Ratio comparing lease-adjusted funded debt (funded debt plus all lease
liabilities) to EBITDAR (as defined in the 2021 Credit Facility) with a maximum of 3.5x; and
• A Consolidated Fixed Coverage Charge Ratio comparing EBITDAR to fixed charges and certain current liabilities
(as defined in the 2021 Credit Facility) with a minimum of 1.2x.
As of January 29, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants.
As of January 29, 2022, a total of $100.0 million was available to us from the 2021 Credit Facility.
Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts such as software license commitments and service contracts were $28.1 million and $14.8 million at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively. These purchase obligations are primarily due within five years and are recorded as liabilities when goods are received or services rendered.
We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancellable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments.
Other Economic Factors
Our ability to provide quality imported merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to political and economic factors and influences that we cannot control. National or international events, including changes in government trade, geopolitical conflicts or other policies, could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations. Consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures.
Our Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8, Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both (i) most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (ii) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of such policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies reflected in the consolidated financial statements are detailed below.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when control of the merchandise is transferred to our customer. Sales are recorded net of expected returns at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Net sales exclude sales taxes because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting these taxes.
The net deferred revenue liability for gift cards, customer orders and layaways at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, was $9.6 million and $8.8 million, respectively, recognized in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets. In Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, gift card breakage income was recognized in net sales in proportion to the redemption pattern of rights exercised by the customer and was immaterial for all years.
During the fiscal years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, $1.4 million, $1.2 million and $1.7 million of gift card deferred revenue from prior periods was realized, respectively.
Loyalty Program: We offer the Hibbett Rewards program whereby upon registration and in accordance with the terms of the program, customers earn points on certain purchases. Points convert into rewards at defined thresholds. The short-term future performance obligation liability is estimated at each reporting period based on historical conversion and redemption patterns. The liability is included in other accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets and was $3.7 million and $3.4 million at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively.
Return Sales: The liability for return sales is estimated at each reporting period based on historical return patterns and is recognized at the transaction price. The liability is included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The return asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of goods sold for our right to recover the merchandise returned by the customer is immaterial.
Index
Inventories. Inventories are valued using the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value method. Items are removed from inventory using the weighted average cost method.
Lower of Cost and Net Realizable Value: We regularly review inventories to determine if the carrying value exceeds net realizable value, and we record an accrual to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value as necessary. We account for obsolescence as part of our lower of cost and net realizable value accrual based on historical trends and specific identification. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, the accrual was $5.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively. A determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment.
Shrink Reserves: We accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical results of our physical inventory counts. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger. Physical inventory counts are performed on a cyclical basis. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, the accrual was $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Inventory Purchase Concentration: Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon close relationships with our vendors. Our largest vendor, Nike, represented 61.0%, 65.0% and 67.7% of our purchases for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. Our second largest vendor, adidas, represented 6.9%, 6.6% and 7.2% of our purchases for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill and the City Gear tradename are indefinite-lived intangible assets which are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock. If an asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed and the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value is recorded as an impairment charge to current income.
Due to the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we determined that indicators of impairment were present during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. As a result, we performed interim impairment testing on goodwill and the City Gear tradename as of April 15, 2020, using updated assumptions around prospective financial information, growth rates, discount rates applied to future cash flows and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry.
In valuing goodwill, we use a combination of the Discounted Cash Flow methodology and the Guideline Public Company methodology, which require assumptions be made related to future cash flows, discount rate and comparable public companies. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we determined that goodwill of our City Gear reporting unit was fully impaired and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $19.7 million. No impairment related to goodwill was recognized during Fiscal 2020.
A reconciliation of goodwill from February 1, 2020 to January 30, 2021 consists of the following:
In valuing the tradename intangible, we use the Relief from Royalty method which requires assumptions related to future revenues, royalty rate and discount rate. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we determined that the City Gear tradename was partially impaired and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $8.9 million in store operating, selling and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. No impairment related to the tradename was recognized during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2020.
A reconciliation of tradename from February 1, 2020 to January 29, 2022 consists of the following:

Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including lease assets, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based on historical operations and predictions of future profitability. Significant assumptions are required to estimate cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of assets in operations, including margin on net sales, occupancy costs, payroll and related costs, and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the related asset or asset group to its estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model, quoted market value, or other valuation technique, as appropriate. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For depreciable long-lived assets, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset. Impairment loss calculations require significant judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values.
