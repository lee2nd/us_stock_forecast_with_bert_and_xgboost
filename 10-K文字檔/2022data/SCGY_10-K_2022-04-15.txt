Business Overview
We conduct our businesses primarily through our 98.75% owned subsidiary, Macao E-Media Development Company Limited, a Macau Company (“MED”), and 50% owned subsidiary, Gold Gold Gold Limited (“3G”), a Hong Kong company.
In this MD&A section, we will primarily discuss the business of MED, as 3G is a joint venture and its financial position and results of operations are not consolidated with our consolidated financial statements. The financial position and results of operations of 3G are summarized in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements.
As a leading mobile platform of ordering and delivery services for restaurants or other merchants, we operate in Macau, and our businesses are built on our platform, Aomi App (the “Platform”). The Platform connects restaurants/merchants (collectively referred to as “Merchants”) with consumers and delivery riders. The Platform is created to serve the needs of these three key constituencies and to become more intelligent and efficient with every customer order. As we grow, we enjoy the benefits of scale and enjoy our competitive advantages, and at the same time we deliver substantial benefits to everyone we serve. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Platform generated over 8,400,000 transactions, totaling $1,049,142,000 MOP (approximately $130,649,653) in Gross Merchandise Volume.
MED was found in Macau in 2011. In May 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement, by and among the Company, MED, and the shareholders of MED, whereby the Company acquired 98.75% of MED’s issued and outstanding share capital. As consideration for the MED Shares, the Company agreed to issue the sellers, or its assigns, a total of 131,337,500 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at $0.50 per share, for an aggregate consideration of $65,668,750. The acquisition was closed in September 2021. As a result of this acquisition, MED becomes a 98.75% owned subsidiary of the Company.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations and Financial Performance
Outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Substantially all of our revenues and workforce are concentrated in Macau and in China. In response to the intensifying efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Macau government took a number of actions, which included extending the Chinese New Year holiday, quarantining individuals suspected of having COVID-19, asking residents to stay at home and to avoid public gathering, among other things. During the early part of 2021, COVID-19 caused a temporary slowdown of our operation, and as a result, our revenue did not increase as we predicted in 2021. It is, however, still unclear how the pandemic will evolve going forward, and we cannot assure you whether the COVID-19 pandemic will again bring about a significantly negative impact on our business operations, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to a negative impact to our total revenues.
While we have resumed business operations, there remain significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak and its further development as a global pandemic. Hence, the extent of the business disruption and the related impact on our financial results and outlook for 2022 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken globally to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. We are still assessing our business operations and the total impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial
condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated cost of good sold for $7,664,721 compared to $Nil for the year of 2020. Currently the Company is attributable to delivery rider costs and purchase of inventory.
Operating expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s operating expenses were $3,344,172 compared to $472,963 for the year of 2020. The increase is primarily the result of expense paid towards Macau and Zhuhai business operations in 2021.
Other Income (Expense)
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had $29,081 of interest expense, net, as compared to $11,203 of interest expense for the same period last year. The interest expense in 2021 and 2020 is related to notes payable issued in 2018 and 2019. The increase is primarily the result of new bank loan paid towards Macao and Zhuhai business operations in 2021.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a net loss of $967,685, or $(0.005) per share, as compared to a net loss of $461,519, or $(0.004) per share, for the year of 2020.
Going Concern
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $967,685 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and had an accumulated deficit of $10,268,776 as of December 31, 2021. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations. Moreover, the Company may be continuously raising capital through the sale of debt and equity securities.
The Company’s ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this stage. If the Company is unsuccessful in its endeavors, it may be forced to cease operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty which may include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
These factors have raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing or achieve profitability. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4,920,375 and a working capital deficit of $2,805,610. The Company generates a significant amount of cash flows from operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company used net cash of $5,821,075 from its operating activities primarily from our net loss of $967,685, net with depreciation and amortization of $67,621, a disposal of equipment of $1,125, an increase in account receivables of $135,396, an increase in amount due from related company of $19,452, an increase in amount due from associate of $24,678, an increase in amount due from shareholder of $998,391, an increase in inventories of $44,310, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $149,058, a decrease in deposits of $42,607, a decrease in other receivables of $558,275, an increase in accrued expense of $654,419, an increase in amount due to related company of $20,002, a decrease in deposit received of $215,356, a decrease in other payables of $3,547,542, a decrease in account payable of $1,361,372. By comparison, net cash used in operating activities was $447,682 in 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company used net cash of $732,954 from its investing activities which comprised with purchase of equipment of $22,449, loan to associate of $997,923 and net cash inflow from acquisition of subsidiaries of $287,418. By comparison, net cash used in investing activities was $Nil in 2020
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s financing activities provided net cash of $11,652,469, which was comprised of repayment of bank loans of $29,392, repayment of notes payable of $243,664, repayment of stock subscriptions of $1,041,539, proceeds of issuance of shares capital of $12,967,064. By comparison, net cash provided by financing activities was $375,792 in 2020.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and borrowings available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than currently expected. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce operating costs, which could impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.
The bank loans are borrowed by MED and Zhuhai Chengmi Technology Company Limited (“Chengmi”), which are the new subsidiaries during business combinations in September 2021. The banking credit facility from MED dated March 3, 2020 for a maximum principal of $374,672 expiring July 31, 2025 at an interest rate of 4.25% per annum. This loan is secured against the directors of MED and for the use of MED operation due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Another bank loan borrowed by Chengmi with principle of $464,583 and $309,721 and expiring December 2022 and May 2023, respectively, at an interest rate of 4.6% and 4.45% per annum.
Until we are able to generate sufficient liquidity from operations, we intend to continue to fund operations from cash on-hand, and through private debt or equity placements of our securities. Our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to generate sufficient liquidity from operations and/or raise additional capital through such sources as equity and debt financings, collaborative and licensing agreements and strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that additional capital will become available or, if it does, that it will become available on acceptable terms, or that any additional capital we may obtain will be sufficient to meet our long-term needs. We currently have no commitments for any additional capital, both internally and externally.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Obligations
The Company leases approximately 250 square feet of space in Jersey City, New Jersey under a month-by-month basis at rent of $650 per month. In addition, the Company entered into a two-year lease for office space of approximately 770 square feet in Hong Kong, expiring January 2024 with monthly payments of approximately $4,393 per month. Besides, the acquisition of Macau and Zhuhai subsidiaries, it results on addition lease for office and warehouse approximately 38,780 square feet in Macau and Zhuhai, expiring within year 2022 to 2024 with monthly payment of approximately $44,724 per month.
Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
