Overview
Summary
We are an international pharmaceutical company with a proprietary line of nutraceuticals and distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, OTC medications and medical devices. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on acquisitions of established companies and our ability to maintain better pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are designed to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create added value for our shareholders. In particular, we look to enhance our pharmaceutical and over-the-counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective company acquisition opportunities. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is operating within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.
We continue to rapidly expand our distribution network worldwide and open new markets for our proprietary line of branded pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and nutraceuticals through our distribution channels and e-commerce market place. We use our extensive network with direct access to Europe’s primary sales channels for pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, which includes over 160 pharmaceutical wholesale distributors in Europe’s largest markets, over 40,000 pharmacies in Europe and 1,500 pharmacies in Greece. We achieve stable supply of pharmaceuticals from Doc Pharma which enhances our ability to scale our expansion. We receive full priority in the production of nutraceuticals and volumes. Our full production in Greece ensures a decisive production-cost advantage whilst we secure additional discounts by leveraging our purchasing scale.
Our focus on investing in technology enhances yield cost savings and economies of scale the safety, distribution and warehousing efficiency and reliability, as a result of 0% error selection rate and acceleration order fulfillment.
Revenue sources
The Company operates in the wholesale distribution of branded pharmaceutical products, over the counter (“OTC”) products, medical devices, vitamins and a variety of nutraceuticals, including its proprietary label.
Import/Export of Branded pharmaceuticals
We conduct wholesale import and export of branded pharmaceutical products throughout Europe by our subsidiaries. We source licensed pharmaceuticals from wholesalers at a lower cost, primarily in Greece and the U.K. and sell to other European wholesalers. Our capital efficient business model is based on infrastructure, efficiency and scale.
Full-line Wholesale
We conduct direct distribution and sales of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, branded pharmaceuticals and OTC products. Our distribution network exceeds over 1,500 pharmacies in Greece. We have created an upgraded and high-end distribution center in Greece due to our Robotic systems and integrated automations (“ROWA” robotics).
Nutraceutical
We have created and developed our own proprietary branded nutraceutical products, named “Sky Premium Life®” which was launched in 2018. We have a full portfolio of fast moving and specialty formulas with at least 75 product codes including vitamins, minerals and other herbal extracts. We expect to reach the number of 150 product codes by the end of 2022. Our nutraceutical products are manufactured exclusively by Doc Pharma, a related party of the Company. Our nutraceutical products have penetrated several markets within 2021 through digital channels such as Amazon and Tmall.
We focus on nutraceutical products because we foresee it as a relatively under-penetrated market throughout Europe with potential of high growth opportunities due to its large market size and margin contribution as the demand for nutraceutical products is increasing globally.
Branded pharmaceuticals
We are engaged in the promotion, distribution and sale of branded pharmaceutical products throughout Europe. Through a related company, we have the distribution rights to over 70 fast-moving pharmaceutical products. There is a significant growth on opportunities through product additions and geographic expansion.
Risks
Supply chain disruption is a growing concern for the European pharmaceutical industry as it increasingly looks to cut costs by relying on ‘emerging markets’, where standards can be lower in terms of compliance, ethics and health and safety.
Hikes in the price of medicine and their impact on the sustainability of the healthcare systems are garnering more and more attention. European regulators are willing to play their part in safeguarding continued access to safe and effective medicines. Regulators can speed up the approval of branded pharmaceuticals and biosimilars to boost competition and drive down prices.
Cuts in healthcare spending keep occurring since the financial crises of the late of 2000s. Europe’s slow recovery has been uneven, with austerity and economic uncertainty, especially in the EU’s poorer member states, such as Greece.
The Effects of COVID-19 on Our 2021 Operations
The World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since the outbreak in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has expanded its impact to Europe, where all of our operations reside as well as our employees, suppliers and customers. To date, our operations have been affected by the following adverse risks:
Adverse Risks
·
Drug shortages due to ban of exports
·
Problems/restrictions in supply chain
·
Logistics delays
·
Restrictions on employees’ ability to work
·
Liquidity issues (AR/AP) - payment delays
·
National or EU long lasting recession
Subsequent to year-end, management has identified opportunities as listed below, that could balance, at least in part, the adverse effects of COVID-19 during the fiscal year-end 2021. However, there can be no assurance that this will occur.
Opportunities
·
Sales increase of OTC products branded
·
Sales increase of Vitamins (Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, multivitamins)
·
Sales increase of antibacterial products and medicine masks
·
Obtain exclusive distribution rights for detection test kits for COVID-19
·
Governmental financing incentives related to liquidity
Management’s Expectations
Management believes that there could be a positive long-term outcome from COVID-19, which could result in an increase in sales of OTC branded products, nutraceuticals, antibacterial products, gloves, oximeters, thermometers and medical masks. However, there is no guarantee of such results. Therefore, we will increase R&D as we are aiming to innovate and create new products in order to help combat against COVID-19. We have adapted our strategy in response to COVID-19 and will continue to do so, since we are expecting the impact of COVID-19 to continue for the next 12 months.
What Effect Will COVID-19 Have on the Company’s Disclosure Controls
Management does not believe COVID-19 will have a significant effect on our disclosure controls as there have been no changes to date. Our operations have continued at a normal pace, at least 95% of our staff continue to work on site and those staff who are working remotely have no impact on our disclosure controls.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2021 versus December 31, 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a net loss of $7,961,649 on revenue of $56,239,667, versus net income of $820,786 on revenue of $55,406,337, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue
Revenue during the Company’s twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, increased by 1.5% as compared to revenues in the period ended December 31, 2020.
Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the member states of European Union, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations.
Cost of Goods Sold
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we had direct costs of goods sold of $47,909,180 associated to cost of goods sold versus $47,345,957 from the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of goods sold year over year increased by 1.19% in 2021 as compared to 2020, in proportion to the increase in revenue.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,330,487 compared with the $8,060,380 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross profit increased by $270,107 or 3.35% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit was primarily due to the increase sales of our own brand of nutraceuticals; SkyPremium Life.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had general and administrative costs of $9,208,701, salaries and wages expenses of $2,472,953 sales and marketing expenses of $732,545 and depreciation and amortization expense of $449,692 for a net operating loss of $4,533,404. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had general and administrative costs of $2,102,869, salaries and wages of $2,082,453, sales and marketing expenses of $763,170 and depreciation and amortization expense of $397,595 for a net operating profit of $2,714,293.
The approximate 140.62% increase in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021, versus the prior year ended, is mainly attributable to the share-based compensation of $5.9 million and provisions for doubtful accounts of $1,087,339.
Interest Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had interest expense of $2,823,842 and non-cash interest expenses of $757,021 related to the fair value of extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount, versus the year ending December 31, 2020, where we had interest expense of $2,761,004 and non-cash interest expenses of $34,106 related to the fair value of warrants for services, extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount.
Unrealized Foreign Currency Losses
Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $1,006,517 for the year ended December 31, 2021, such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $16,601,199 versus unrealized foreign currency income of $871,235 such that our net comprehensive income for the period was $1,692,021 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase relates to the significant transactions within the intercompany entities and the volatility/fluctuation from the prior year of the Euro to USD exchange.
Going Concern
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had net loss of $7,961,649, and net cash used in operations of $7,097,174 during the year ended December 31, 2021; and working capital of $10,950,492 and an accumulated deficit of $34,345,506 as of December 31, 2021. During the fiscal year, the Company has undergone a strategic review process to help find a definitive solution to the Company’s accumulated deficit constraints. Options under consideration in the strategic review process include, but are not limited to, securing new debt, exchange debt for equity, restructuring current debt facilities from short term into long-term making the proper actions for new fund raising. The Company has adequate cash from operations in order to cover its operating costs and to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had working capital of $10,950,492 versus a working capital of $6,482,739 as of December 31, 2020. This increase in the working capital surplus is primarily attributed to the Company’s operating profit in the year ending as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had net cash of $286,487 versus $628,395 as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $7,097,174 versus $11,501,718 net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to apply its investment program to expand through organic business growth and, where appropriate, the execution on selective company and license acquisitions, and incurred significant general and administrative expenses to enable it to finance and grow its business and operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was $826,817 net cash used in investing activities versus $117,744 used in during the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year ending December 31, 2021 this was due to the purchase of fixed assets and licenses. In the year ending December 31, 2020, this was due to the purchase of fixed assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was $7,267,777 of net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities versus $12,460,541 provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020.
We believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of December 31, 2021 will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, the Company will require additional financing in fiscal year 2022 in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, it may be forced to curtail its development activities.
We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of December 31, 2021, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiaries and from debt or equity financing, or from loans from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds.

Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months
Specifically, our plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:
We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. Over the medium term we expect to further expand our market shares. However, during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs.
Our plan for our own branded nutraceuticals is to enlarge our portfolio up to 150 SKUs by the end of 2022 including more basic line formulas to cover more customer needs of any age, advanced formulations, formulas based on herbs and further clinical studies with R&D for further products. Our plan for geographic expansion in distributing and market penetration in EU, Asia, USA, Canada is based on exclusive distributors, wholesalers, e-commerce, development of franchising model, alliances and acquisitions of nutraceutical companies.
In addition, our plan for branded pharmaceuticals is geographic expansion across the world, especially in EU and UK, as well as in third countries with fast registration and developed markets with liberalized OTC policies for online pharmacies and supermarkets. We also intend to enhance our exclusive distribution rights with a growing basis of cooperating partners whilst purchasing generics’, biosimilar drugs’ and OTC licenses. We also intend to enhance our product expectance by registered copyrights and trademarks in all OTC drugs. In addition, it remains committed to strategic research and development across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.
Our plan for our full line wholesale is to expand in the Greek territory, enlarge our customer portfolio and integrate of established sales network of pharmacies through the use of B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms and exclusive distributors. We are also aiming in increasing the exports of branded pharmaceuticals as we focus on higher profit margins categories (OTC and VMS), deliver 3PL services to pharma companies, put in force loyalty programs, provide added value services to pharmacies and emergency deliveries to VIP customers. The Company will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand its network of pharmacies and products in areas that it believes will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins.
The Company is growing its business through organic growth, market penetration, geographic expansion and acquisitions which would add value to its business and its Shareholders. The Company is also committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, joint ventures and dispositions. Moreover, it hopes to continue to build on its portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand its OTC and nutraceutical product portfolio. Thus, the Company is developing a sound sales distribution network specializing in its own branded nutraceutical products.
The Company’s main objective is expanding the business operations of its subsidiaries by concentrating its efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical Company. The Company views its business development activity as an enabler of its strategies, and it seeks to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic, and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles the Company assesses businesses and assets as part of its regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continues to consider trading development activities for its businesses. The Company’s objective is the optimization of operating expenses across all entities without compromising the quality of the Company’s services and products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits, and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company’s business.
The pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential within the European pharmaceutical market, if service, price and quality are strictly directed towards the customer requirements. The Company will continue to encounter competition in the market by product, service, reliability, and a high level of quality. On the procurement side, the Company can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks, the Company diversifies its sources of supply all over Europe. It secures its high-quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection, as well as active suppliers’ system management.
While the Company intends to pursue these milestones, there may be circumstances where, for valid business reasons or due to factors beyond the control of the Company (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), a re-allocation of efforts may be necessary or advisable. Although the Company does not currently anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause material delays in the timelines or estimates set out above, due to the evolving nature of COVID-19 and its impacts, these timelines and estimates may require adjustment in the future.
The Company intends to spend the funds available to it in working capital, inventories, intangible assets, acquisitions, R&D, sales and marketing expenses. Due to the uncertain nature of the industry in which the Company will operate, projects may be frequently reviewed and reassessed. Accordingly, while it is currently intended by management that the available funds will be expended as set forth above, actual expenditures may in fact differ from these amounts and allocations.
Significant Equipment
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment for the next twelve months aside from a few pieces of IT equipment. Nevertheless, we will replace essential equipment for operations if it is required within the year.
Employees
In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we have, and will remain, focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales, selection, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. We have plans to increase the number of our employees by adding more sales people during the next twelve months.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted the modified retrospective adoption in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2018. The new guidance introduces a five-step model for recognizing revenue by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring the promised goods to the customer. Once these steps are met, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product. Adoption of ASC 606 has not changed the timing and nature of the Company’s revenue recognition and there has been no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Foreign Currency. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders’ equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity’s local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.
Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company is liable for income taxes in Greece and the United Kingdom of England. The corporate income tax rate in Greece is 22%, (tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013) (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely) and 19% in the United Kingdom of England. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.
We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.
We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management’s judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position’s technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions.
We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense, respectively.
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes” as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of the U.S. net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.
The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Holdings Inc., which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the United Kingdom of England. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States, but recognize the income tax liabilities in Greece and the United Kingdom of England. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. The new guidance creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principles of ASC 805, Business Combinations. The new guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for all public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and include interim periods. The guidance is effective for all other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2021-08 on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04-Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt- Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options, to clarify and reduce diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2021-04 on its consolidated financial statements.
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
