Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources. Statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) that are not historical may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
You should read the following MD&A in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see Part I. Item 1A “Risk Factors” above and “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
All amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of the Company. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as "believe," "expect," "expectation," "anticipate," "may," "could," "intend," "belief," "estimate," "plan," "target," "predict," "likely," "should," "forecast," "outlook," or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors," as updated from time to time in the Company’s SEC filings.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the May 2022 flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted.
We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure:
Segment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, amortization expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, the gain on finance lease termination, other items, net, the charges
related to acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil and the costs of exiting the Russian market have all been excluded from segment profit.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and Adjusted Diluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (EPS). These measures exclude the impact of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, costs related to acquisition and integration, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the CARES Act.
Non-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination and the loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred, as well as the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the CARES Act.
Organic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, change in Russia and Argentina operations and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:
Impact of acquisitions. Energizer completed two acquisitions in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, a battery plant in Indonesia on October 1, 2020 and a formulation company in the United States on December 1, 2020 (Formulations Acquisition). These adjustments include the impact each acquisition's on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption for the first year's operations directly after the acquisition date. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs.
Change in Russia Operations. The Company exited the Russian market in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the increased global and economic and political uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This adjusts for the change in Russian sales and segment profit from the prior year post exit.
Change in Argentina Operations. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Argentina affiliate due to the designation of the economy as highly inflationary as of July 1, 2018.
Impact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate, as well as the impact of hedging on the currency fluctuation.
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and adjusted Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Details for adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to acquisition and integration, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of exiting the Russian market and the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Energizer continued to be impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its related effects. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to disruption in our global supply chain and changes in demand for products. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on the Company's results of operations, below are factors that the Company believes have affected its results for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.
•The Company has faced higher operating costs due to the global supply chain constraints, including for raw materials and transportation.
•Labor availability continues to be a challenge across most of the Company's sites in the US and Singapore.
•The Company has invested in incremental safety stock to partially mitigate the impacts of the continued volatility of the global supply network.
An inflationary environment marked by higher manufacturing and transportation costs as well as increased commodity costs is expected to continue into fiscal 2023. While we did not experience significant disruptions in our operations during fiscal 2022, the risks of future negative impacts due to transportation, logistical or supply constraints and higher commodity
costs for certain raw materials remain present, and the Company continues to experience corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures.
The full impact of COVID-19 on our financial and operating performance will depend significantly on the duration and severity of the pandemic and related disruption to our global supply chain, the emergence of variants and the effectiveness of vaccines against these variants, and any future government actions affecting consumers and the economy in general, among other factors beyond our knowledge or control.
For further discussion of the possible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent events on our business, financial conditions and results of operations, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.
Exit of Russian Market
During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company exited the Russian market due to global economic and political uncertainty related to the conflict between Russian and the Ukraine and the resultant sanctions imposed on Russia.
While neither Russia nor Ukraine constitutes a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could disrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Russian subsidiary comprised approximately one percent of our business.
With the decision to exit the Russian market, the Company terminated the employment of all our Russian colleagues and reviewed our Russian assets for impairment. Exiting the Russian market resulted in additional Costs of products sold of $1.3 related to the impairment of inventory in Russia and shipping costs to get inventory to other markets, impairment of other assets and severance recorded to SG&A of $5.8, and currency impacts recorded in Other items, net of $7.5 in fiscal 2022.
Brazil Manufacturing Plant Flood
In May 2022, the Company's Jaboatao, Brazil battery manufacturing facility had severe flooding due to historic levels of rain in the area. The plant was not operational for the month of June, however some production began again in July and the majority is now back on line. The Company has an insurance policy with an approximate $10 deductible. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded costs related to the flood net of insurance proceeds of $9.7 in Cost of products sold, primarily related to damaged inventory at the plant. Based on the insurance plan deductible, the Company anticipates that further losses from the damage should be minimal.
Fiscal Year 2021 Acquisitions
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with FDK Corporation to acquire its subsidiary PT FDK Indonesia, a battery manufacturing facility (FDK Acquisition). On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition for a contractual purchase price of $18.2. After contractual and working capital adjustments, the Company paid cash of $16.9 and a working capital adjustment of $0.7 during fiscal 2021. The acquisition of the FDK Indonesia facility increased the Company's alkaline battery production capacity and allows us to avoid future planned capital expenditures.
On December 1, 2020 the Company acquired a North Carolina-based company that specializes in developing formulations for cleaning tasks. Their products are both sold to customers directly and licensed to manufacturers. This acquisition is expected to bring significant innovation capabilities in formulations to our organization. The purchase price and total cash paid for the acquisition was $51.2. During fiscal 2022, the working capital settlement was finalized, reducing the purchase price by $1.0.
Battery Acquisition
On January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.'s (Spectrum) global battery, lighting and portable power business (Battery Acquisition) including the brands Rayovac® and Varta® (Acquired Battery Business). The acquisition expanded our battery portfolio globally with the addition of a strong value brand.
On January 2, 2020, the Company sold the Varta® consumer battery business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany (Varta Divestiture or Divestment Business) to VARTA Aktiengesellschaft (VARTA AG). These operations were included as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Auto Care Acquisition
On January 28, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum’s global auto care business, including Armor All®, STP®, and A/C PRO® brands (Auto Care Acquisition).
Acquisition and Integration Costs
The Company incurred pre-tax acquisition and integration costs related to the above acquisitions of $16.5, $68.9 and $68.0 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Pre-tax costs recorded in Costs of products sold were $6.0, $33.7, and $32.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to the integration restructuring costs of $5.2, $31.9 and $29.3 as discussed in Note 6, Restructuring.
Pre-tax acquisition and integration costs recorded in SG&A were $9.4, $40.0 and $38.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2022 the SG&A expenses primarily related to the integration of acquired information technology systems, consulting costs, and retention-related compensation costs. In fiscal 2021 and 2020 these expenses primarily related to consulting fees for the 2020 restructuring program, success incentives, and costs of integrating the information technology systems of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition businesses.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded $1.1, $1.1 and $1.3 in Research and development, respectively.
Included in Other items, net was pre-tax income of $5.9 and $4.1 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the gain on a sale of assets of $3.3, which was part of the integration restructuring discussed in Note 6.
The pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by pre-acquisition insurance proceeds of $4.9 and $1.0 gain on the sale of assets and $0.9 of transition services income, offset by a $2.2 loss related to the hedge contract on the proceeds from the Varta Divestiture and $0.5 of other items.
Restructuring Costs
Subsequent to the fiscal year-end, the Board of Directors approved a profit recovery program, Project Momentum, which includes an enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins, optimizing our manufacturing, distribution and global supply chain networks, and enhancing our organizational efficiency across both segments. The restructuring component of the program is expected to generate $65 to $80 of annual pre-tax savings and the Company estimates that it will incur one-time costs of $40 to $50 over the next two years. During the fourth quarter, the Company accrued $0.9 of consulting costs related to the design of the program. Additionally, along side the restructuring component of the program, Project Momentum includes continuous improvement and working capital initiatives that are designed to strengthen our balance sheet, focus on cash flow, and generate P&L savings of approximately $15 to $20 annually. Total expected pre-tax savings of Project Momentum are between $80 and $100 with approximately $30 to $40 of those savings to be recognized in fiscal year 2023.
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company began implementing restructuring related integration plans for our manufacturing and distribution networks. These plans include the closure and combination of distribution and manufacturing facilities in order to reduce complexity and realize greater efficiencies in our manufacturing, packaging and distribution processes. All activities within this plan were substantially complete by December 31, 2021.
Part of this plan was the exit of our Dixon, IL leased packaging facility, which the Company vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord. The Company terminated the lease agreement, which went into 2028, reducing the finance lease obligations by $9.8. The termination agreement required the Company to pay a termination fee of $4.0, as well as decommissioning costs and brokerage fees. Since the Company has already vacated the facility as part of the 2019 restructuring program, most assets associated with the location have already been fully depreciated. The termination of this lease resulted in a gain of $4.5 recognized in Other items, net during fiscal 2022.
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company initiated a new restructuring program with a primary focus on reorganizing our global end-to-end supply chain network and ensuring accountability by category. This program includes streamlining the Company’s end-to-end supply chain model to enable rapid response to category specific demands and enhancing our ability to better serve our customers. Planning and execution of this program began in fiscal year 2021, with all programs substantially complete by December 31, 2021.
The total pre-tax expense related to these restructuring plans for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1.7, $36.8, and $30.3, respectively. These consisted of charges for employee severance, retention, related benefit costs, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs, relocation, environmental investigatory and mitigation costs, consulting costs and other exit costs, offset by a gain on finance lease termination in fiscal 2022. The costs were reflected in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expense, Research and development, and Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.
Although the Company's restructuring costs are recorded outside of segment profit, if allocated to our new reportable segments, the restructuring costs noted above fiscal 2022 would have been included in our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $1.3 and $0.4, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2021 would have been included in our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $30.7 and $6.1, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2020 would have been incurred within our Batteries & Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of $21.7 and $8.6, respectively.
Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2019 restructuring program since inception were $60.6. Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2020 restructuring program since inception are $19.4.
Fiscal 2022 marks the conclusion of the 2019 and 2020 Restructuring programs. The full amount of savings are now included within our run-rate cost structure. Energizer estimates that total project savings were approximately $55 to $60. The primary impact of the savings were reflected in Cost of products sold. Savings related to the restructuring programs have been fully realized as of September 30, 2022. We do not expect to incur additional material charges for these programs.
Refer to Note 6 Restructuring for further detail.

Financial Results
Net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was $231.5, or a loss of $3.37 per diluted common share, compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $160.9, or $2.11 per diluted common share, and $46.8, or $0.44 per diluted common share, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Net (loss)/earnings from continuing operations and diluted net (loss)/earnings from continuing operations per common share for the time periods presented were impacted by certain items related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, costs related to acquisition and integration, restructuring costs, an acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the one-time impact of Tax structuring and the CARES Act as described in the tables below. The impact of these items on reported net (loss)/earnings from continuing operations and reported diluted net (loss)/earnings from continuing operations per common share are provided below as a reconciliation to arrive at respective non-GAAP measures. See disclosure under Non-GAAP Financial Measures above.
(1) Acquisition and integration costs were included in the following lines in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income:
(2) This represents the estimated earn out achieved through September 30, 2022 and 2021 under the incentive agreements entered into with the Formulations Acquisition and is recorded in SG&A on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.
(3) This represents consulting fees recorded in SG&A as part of the Momentum Restructuring project discussed above.
(4) These are the costs associated with the Company's exit of the Russian market during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Exiting the Russian market resulted in additional COGS of $1.3 related to the impairment of inventory in Russia and shipping costs to get inventory to other markets, impairment of other assets and severance recorded to SG&A of $5.8, and currency impacts recorded in Other items, net of $7.5 in fiscal 2022.
(5) This represents the termination of finance lease in fiscal 2022 associated with a facility that was exited as part of the Company's 2019 Restructuring program. The gain was recorded in Other items, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.
(6) These are the costs associated with the May 2022 flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility, which were recorded in COGS. The majority is related to damaged inventory.
(7) The effective tax rate for the Adjusted - Non-GAAP Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted net earnings from continuing operations per common share was 19.5%, 22.6% and 23.3% for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the costs were incurred.
(8) Represents the impact of a reduction to deferred tax liabilities due to tax structuring activities.
(9) During the year ended September 30, 2022, the mandatory convertible preferred shares were converted to approximately 4.7 million common stock. The full conversion was dilutive and the mandatory preferred stock dividends are excluded from net earnings in the Adjusted dilution calculation. In addition, the dilutive restricted stock equivalent awards are included in the shares calculation on an adjusted basis.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock is not dilutive and the mandatory preferred stock dividends are included in the adjusted dilution calculation.
Operating Results
Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2022 were $3,050.1, an increase of 0.9% from the prior year. Organic net sales increased 3.1% primarily due to:
•Pricing executed in both battery and auto care drove an organic increase of approximately 7.6%; and
•New distribution globally across both battery and auto care contributed approximately 0.8% to organic growth.
•Offsetting these increases was a net volume decrease of approximately 5.3% as a result of lapping the elevated battery demand in the prior year and declines in both battery and auto care related to the previously mentioned pricing actions.
Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2021 were $3,021.5, an increase of 10.1%. Organic net sales increased 7.3% primarily due to:
•New distribution globally and across both reportable segments, contributed approximately 3.9% of the increase;
•Increased year over year global demand contributed approximately 2.6%, driven by higher battery sales earlier in the fiscal year and increased auto care sales throughout the fiscal year; and
•Favorable pricing contributed approximately 0.8% to the organic increase.
For further discussion regarding net sales in each of our reportable product segments, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, please see the section titled “Segment Results” provided below.
Gross Profit
Gross profit dollars were $1,119.5 in fiscal 2022 versus $1,161.4 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs of $6.0 and $33.7, respectively, and the current year impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility of $9.7 and exiting the Russian market of $1.3, gross profit dollars were $1,136.5 in fiscal 2022 versus $1,195.1 in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit dollars was driven by higher operating costs, including transportation, material and labor costs, consistent with ongoing inflationary trends. The later part of fiscal 2022 was further impacted by operating inefficiencies related to reduced production volumes as the Company lowered overall inventory levels on hand. Partially offsetting these margin impacts was the positive impact of executed price increases in battery and auto care, the elimination of prior year COVID-19 costs and synergies of approximately $6.
Gross profit dollars were $1,161.4 in fiscal 2021 versus $1,081.9 in fiscal 2020. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs of $33.7 and $32.0, respectively, gross profit dollars were $1,195.1 in fiscal 2021 versus $1,113.9 in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to the organic revenue growth discussed above, impact of FY21 acquisitions and approximately $50 of synergies achieved during the year, partially offset by the higher input costs, including labor, commodities, tariffs and transportation costs, consistent with ongoing inflationary trends.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2022 was 36.7% versus 38.4% in the prior year. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs, and the current year impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility and exiting the Russian market, gross margin was 37.3%, down 230 basis points from prior year. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2021 was 38.4% versus 39.4% in the prior year. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs, gross margin was 39.6%, down 100 basis points from prior year.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)
SG&A expenses were $484.5 in fiscal 2022, or 15.9% of net sales, as compared to $487.2, or 16.1% of net sales for fiscal 2021, and $483.3, or 17.6% of net sales for fiscal 2020. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were acquisition and integration costs of $9.4, $40.0 and $38.8, respectively. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 also included an acquisition earn out of $1.1 and $3.4, respectively, related to the Formulations Acquisition. Fiscal 2022 also included $5.8 related to the exit of the Russian market and $0.9 of Project Momentum consulting costs.
In fiscal 2022, SG&A excluding acquisition and integration costs, the earn out, costs from exiting the Russian market and Project Momentum costs was $467.3 or 15.3%, compared to fiscal 2021 of $443.8 or 14.7%. The increase was primarily driven by increased environmental costs related to a legacy facility that has been sold by the Company, recycling fees, travel and higher IT spending related to our investment in digital transformation.
In fiscal 2021, SG&A excluding acquisition and integration costs was $443.8 or 14.7%, compared to fiscal 2020 of $444.5 or 16.2%. The decrease, as a percent of Net sales, was driven by synergy realization and higher net sales while SG&A expense remained consistent with prior year.
Advertising and Sales Promotion (A&P)
A&P was $137.1 in fiscal 2022, a decrease of $25.0 as compared to fiscal 2021. A&P as a percent of net sales was 4.5%, 5.4% and 5.4% in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Research and Development
R&D expense was $34.7 in fiscal 2022, $34.5 in fiscal 2021, $35.4 in fiscal 2020. As a percent of net sales, R&D expense was consistent as a percentage of sales at 1.1% in fiscal 2022, 1.1% in fiscal 2021, and 1.3% in fiscal 2020.
Amortization Expense
Amortization expense for fiscal 2022 was $61.1 compared to $61.2 in fiscal 2021 and $56.5 in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2022 and 2021 results included the full year of amortization on the Custom Accessories Europe (CAE) acquisition, as well as amortization for the Formulations Acquisition, discussed in Note 4.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for fiscal 2022 was $541.9. This included a non-cash impairment on the Armor All trade name of $370.4, STP trade name of $26.3, Rayovac trade name of $127.8 and a non-cash impairment related to the Auto Care International reporting unit goodwill of $17.4. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023, a decrease in the
branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The goodwill non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate.
Interest expense
Interest expense for fiscal 2022 was $158.4, as compared to fiscal 2021 expense of $161.8 and $195.0 in fiscal 2020. The Company took advantage of favorable debt markets in fiscal 2021 and 2020 and refinanced its long-term debt resulting in a decline of interest expense of $3.4 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and $33.2 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
The Loss on the extinguishment of debt was $103.3 for fiscal year 2021 and relates to the Company's refinancing of its €650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021, the redemption of the $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2027 in January 2021 and the term loan refinancing in December 2020. The Company also amended certain covenants in its credit agreement, which created additional capacity and flexibility.
The Loss on the extinguishment of debt was $94.9 for fiscal year 2020 and relates to the Company's July 2020 redemption of its $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2025 and the redemption of the $750.0 Senior Notes due in 2026, which were redeemed subsequent to year-end on October 16, 2020. The loss also includes the write off of deferred financing fees related to the term loan refinancing in December 2019.
Other Items, Net
Other items, net was expense of $7.3, income of $2.9 and expense of $2.0 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is summarized below:
Income Taxes
For fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 24.2%. The current year rate was unfavorably impacted by the tax impact of the goodwill impairment. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 19.5% as compared to 22.6% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is primarily due to the release of reserves from statute limitations and settlements with tax authorities.
For fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 4.3%. The current year rate was favorably impacted by tax structuring resulting in a reduction to a deferred tax liability and the favorable tax impact resulting from the refinancing of the €650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6% as compared to 23.3% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is due to the favorable return to provision adjustments and decreases in certain limited expenses.
For fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was 30.9%. The current year rate includes costs related to acquisition and integration in addition to the unfavorable impact of $1.8 for the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provides, among other things, increased interest deduction limitations to companies which can decrease overall cash taxes paid. Excluding the impact of these non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 23.3% as compared to 18.5% in the prior year. The increase in the rate versus prior year is due to the country mix of earnings which drove a higher foreign tax rate as well as the expiration of certain tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.
Energizer’s effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates. In addition, the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. on the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other U.S. tax reform could impact our effective tax rate in the future.
Argentina Hyperinflation
Effective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary are consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Company’s reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. It is difficult to determine what continuing impact the use of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina may have on our consolidated financial statements as such impact is dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in our affiliates balance sheet.
Segment Results
As of October 1, 2021, the Company changed its reportable operating segments from two geographical segments, previously Americas and International, to two product groupings, Battery & Lights and Auto Care. This change came with the completion of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition integrations in fiscal 2022. The Company changed its reporting structure to better reflect what the chief operating decision maker is reviewing to make organizational decisions and resource allocations. The Company has recast the information for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 to align with this presentation.
Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses (including share-based compensation costs), amortization of intangibles, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration activities, including restructuring charges, acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, gain on finance lease termination and loss on extinguishment of debt are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of acquisition and integration and restructuring costs from segment results reflects management’s view on how it evaluates segment performance. The Company also excludes amortization of intangibles and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from segments as these are non-cash items related to the original purchase of the intangibles and not utilized to evaluate current segment performance.
Energizer’s operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the product segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include the sales and marketing functions, as well as human resources, IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.
Total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 increased 0.9%, due to organic sales increase of $94.4, or 3.1%, and an $11.9 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary. Partially offsetting these increases was the decrease in sales from exiting the Russian market of $19.3, or 0.6%, and unfavorable impact of currency of $58.4, or 2.0%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows:
•Batteries & Lights net sales improved 1.0% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by organic net sales growth of 3.5% due to pricing increases (approximately 7.5%) and new distribution in battery & lights (approximately 0.5%). This was partially offset by the expected decline in battery demand compared to the elevated COVID-19 related sales in the prior year period (approximately 4.5%).
•Auto Care net sales improved 0.7% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 1.6% due to global price increases (approximately 8.0%) and new distribution in both the North American and International markets (approximately 1.5%). This was offset by a decrease in volumes to prior year related to the previously mentioned pricing actions, the lapping of elevated demand in the prior year and the negative impact higher gas prices had on miles driven, consumer foot traffic in the category, and a tendency to defer auto maintenance, particularly impacting our AC recharge business (approximately 8.0%).
Total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 increased 10.1%, including organic sales increase
of $200.5, or 7.3%, sales related to the FY21 acquisitions of $27.0, or 1.0%, a $6.8 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary, and favorable impact of currency of $42.4, or 1.6%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 are as follows:
• Battery & Lights net sales improved 8.1% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 5.1% due to distribution gains primarily in North and Latin America (approximately 3.0%),
strong replenishment due to elevated COVID-19 demand primarily in the International markets (approximately 1.5%) and favorable pricing (approximately 1.0%).
• Auto Care net sales improved 18.7% versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 16.7% due to increased distribution gains (approximately 8.5%) and strong replenishment (approximately 7.0%) primarily in North America, as well as favorable pricing (approximately 1.0%).
Refer to Note 10, Segments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation from segment profit to (Loss)/earnings before income taxes.
Total segment profit in fiscal 2022 was $600.1, a decrease of 7.9% versus the prior fiscal year. The decline was driven by organic segment profit decrease of 5.2%, unfavorable movement in foreign currency of $23.8, or 3.6% and the change in Russian operating profit of $4.0 from exiting the Russian market. These decreases were offset by $9.7, or 1.5%, of favorable changes in Argentina operations. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows:
•Battery & Lights segment profit was $553.6, flat versus the prior fiscal year. The organic profit increase was $14.6, or 2.6%, and was driven by top-line growth and lower A&P spending. This growth was partially offset by increased operating costs including higher labor, tariffs and transportation costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin, as well as higher overhead spending.
•Auto Care segment profit was $46.5, a decrease of $51.7, or 52.6%, versus the prior fiscal year. Organic segment profit decreased $48.2, or 49.1%. The organic revenue growth in Auto Care noted above was not enough to offset the increased product input costs which negatively impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting this decline was lower A&P.
Total segment profit in fiscal 2021 was $651.8, an increase of 10.1% versus the prior fiscal year, driven by an
increase of $2.5, or 0.4% from the impact of FY21 acquisitions, organic segment profit improvement of 6.3%, favorable movement in foreign currency of $14.1, or 2.4% and favorable changes in Argentina operations of $5.8, or 1.0%. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 are as follows:
•Battery & Lights segment profit was $553.6, an increase of $41.0, or 8.0%, versus the prior fiscal year. The organic segment profit increased $23.8, or 4.6%, driven by top-line net sales growth. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin as well as planned higher A&P spending.
•Auto Care segment profit was $98.2, an increase of $18.8, or 23.7%, versus the prior fiscal year. The organic segment profit increased $13.6, or 17.1%, driven by top-line net sales growth. This was partially offset by higher overhead spending and planned higher A&P spending in the period.
For fiscal 2022, general corporate expenses were $101.6, an increase of $5.6 compared to fiscal 2021 expense of $96.0. The increase was driven by increased travel expense, and increased bonus and stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower mark to market expense on our deferred compensation plans. For fiscal 2021, general corporate expenses were $96.0, a decrease of $7.8 compared to fiscal 2020 expense of $103.8. The decrease was driven by synergy realization, a reduction in compensation expense and reduced spending, due in part to travel restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher legal and corporate development costs and mark to market expenses on our deferred compensation plans.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Energizer’s primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our short-term and long-term operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our financial condition and prospects, (ii) for debt, our credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See “Risk Factors” for a further discussion.
Cash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2022, Energizer had $205.3 of cash and cash equivalents, approximately 74% of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements, however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.
On December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (2020 Credit Agreement) which provided for a 5-year $400.0 revolving credit facility (2020 Revolving Facility) and a $1,200.0 Term Loan due December 2027. On December 31, 2021 the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the 2020 Revolving Facility to $500.0.
The borrowings under the Term Loan require quarterly principal payments at a rate of 0.25% of the original principal balance. Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR or the Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR or Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin.
The 2020 Revolving Facility replaced the previously outstanding Revolving Credit Facility entered into in 2018. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Revolving Facility and $8.0 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, $492.0 remained available as of September 30, 2022.
Debt Covenants
The agreements governing the Company's debt contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements, and expects to remain in compliance for the next 12 months.
Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.0 in fiscal 2022, $179.7 in fiscal 2021, and $389.3 in fiscal 2020.
Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $1.0 in fiscal 2022 as compared to $179.7 in the prior fiscal year. This decrease of $178.7 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately $165. The working capital change of approximately $165 was primarily a result of the following:
•Approximately $195 in increased accounts receivable due to higher current year sales compared to prior year and reduced factoring relating to those accounts receivables, offset by approximately $29 of changes in accrued sales allowances.
•Approximately $161 due to changes in accounts payable, offset by approximately $26 due to changes in accrued interest, both of which were driven by timing of payments.
•These changes were partially offset by approximately $118 less of an inventory investment compared to the prior year as the Company was proactively building safety stock in the prior year and reduced the investment in the current year as inventory levels return to a more normalized level.
Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $179.7 in fiscal 2021 as compared to $389.3 in fiscal 2020. This change of $209.6 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately $282, partially offset by the increase in cash earnings of approximately $97. The working capital change of approximately $282 was primarily a result of the following:
•Approximately $172 in increased inventory investment compared to the prior year as we have taken a proactive approach to invest in incremental safety stock given the continued volatility of the global supply network-including uncertainty around product sourcing, transportation challenges and labor availability;
•Approximately $45 due to changes in accounts payable and accrued interest driven by timing of payments;
•Approximately $38 in accounts receivable due to higher current year sales compared to prior year; and
•The prior year receipt of approximately $30 related to the agreement and final cash settlement from the Central Authority in Spain on a Spanish VAT refund payment.
Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities from continuing operations was $90.9 in fiscal 2022 and $126.4 in fiscal 2021, and $64.0 in fiscal 2020, and consisted of the following:
•Capital expenditures were $77.8, $64.9, and $65.3 in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
•Proceeds from asset sales were $0.6, $5.7, and $6.4 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 proceeds primarily related to the sale of our Guatemala manufacturing facility acquired with the Battery Acquisition. The fiscal 2020 proceeds primarily represent insurance proceeds received from property, plant and equipment utilized by the Acquired Battery Business damaged in a flood.
•Acquisitions of intangible assets of $14.7 relating to the auto care appearance trade names and formulas acquired in Latin America during fiscal 2022.
•Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and working capital payments, were an inflow of $1.0 in fiscal 2022, and outflow of, $67.2, and $5.1 in fiscal 2021, and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2022 inflow was from the Formulations Acquisition working capital settlement. The fiscal 2021 payments related to the acquired Indonesia battery plant and the Formulations Acquisition. The majority of the fiscal 2020 payment was due to the finalization of working capital adjustments with Spectrum for the Auto Care Acquisition while $1.5 was utilized to complete the CAE acquisition.
Investing cash outflows of approximately $55 to $65 are anticipated in fiscal 2023 for capital expenditures relating to maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments.
Financing Activities
Net cash from financing activities from continuing operations was $79.1 in fiscal 2022 and $394.2 in fiscal 2020. Net used by financing activities from continuing operations was $1,069.1 in fiscal 2021.

Dividends
Total dividends declared to common shareholders were $85.5, and $84.9 was paid in fiscal 2022. For preferred shareholders, total dividends declared $4.0 and paid to preferred shareholders were $8.1. The payment included an accrued dividend from fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022 all of the MCPS automatically converted to approximately 4.7 million of the Company's common stock and no additional dividends will be paid on the MCPS.
Subsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 7, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable on December 16, 2022, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 28, 2022.
Share Repurchases
In November 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved an authorization for Energizer to acquire up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. The Company entered into a $75.0 accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 1.5 million shares were delivered in fiscal 2021
and an additional 0.5 million were delivered upon termination of the agreement on November 18, 2021. The Company acquired in total approximately 2.0 million shares at an average weighted price of $38.30 under the ASR. No additional shares were repurchased in fiscal 2022.
Future share repurchase, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. Share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which, among other changes, created a new corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) based on adjusted financial statement income and imposes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The effective date of these provisions is January 1, 2023. The Company does not expect the enactment of the IRA will have an impact on the Company’s financial statements in 2022. Any excise tax incurred on corporate stock repurchases will generally be recognized as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock acquired and not reported as part of income tax expense.
The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders or repurchases of the Company’s Common stock will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of shares will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its short-term and long-term obligations. The Company's material future obligations include the contractual and purchase commitments described below.
The Company has a contractual commitment to repay its long-term debt of $3,519.1 based on the defined terms of our debt agreements. Within the next twelve months, the company is obligated to pay $12.0 of this total debt. Our interest commitments based on the current debt balance and LIBOR rate on drawn debt at September 30, 2022 is $917.4 with $152.9 expected within the next twelve months. The company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on $700.0 of variable rate debt. Refer to Note 13 Debt for further details.
The Company has a long-term obligation to pay a mandatory transition tax of $16.7. No payments are required until fiscal 2024.
Additionally, Energizer has material future purchase commitments for goods and services which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price and/or quantity. Total future commitments for these obligations over the next 5 years is $21.5. Of this amount, $13.4 is due within the next twelve months. Refer to Note 18 Other Commitments and Contingencies for further details. Energizer is also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend approximately one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position.
Finally, Energizer has operating and financing leases for real estate, equipment, and other assets that include future minimum payments with initial terms of one year or more. Total future operating and finance lease payments at September 30, 2022 are $146.2 and $68.6, respectively. Within the next twelve months, operating and finance lease payments are expected to be $19.4 and $2.5, respectively. Refer to Note 11 Leases for further details.
Other Matters
Environmental Matters
The operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (PRP) and may be required
to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal “Superfund” sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.
Accrued environmental costs at September 30, 2022 were $15.4, of which approximately $5.3 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2023. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of underlying facts, changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements.

The Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management’s estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, acquisition, intangible assets and goodwill, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizer’s significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizer’s accounting policies.
•Revenue Recognition - The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration as determined by the terms of each individual contract. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discount is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms generally include payments within 30 to 60 days and are final with returns or exchanges not permitted unless a special exception is made. Our Auto Care channel terms are longer, in some cases up to 365 days, in which case we use our Trade receivables factoring program for more timely collection. Reserves are established based on historical data and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. The Company does not offer warranties on products.
Energizer offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet
paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.
The Company’s contracts with customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and recorded in Cost of products sold.
•Pension Plans - The determination of the Company’s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made, or impacts to the obligation that are due to changes to assumptions, are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds in conjunction with the cash flows of its plans’ estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which were frozen January 1, 2014 and represent the Company’s most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer Above-Mean yield curve in determining the discount rates.
Of the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Company’s annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2022, a 100 basis point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Company’s U.S. pre-tax pension expense by $4.1. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or higher, respectively, pension obligations. A 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase U.S. pension obligations by $29.8 at September 30, 2022.
As allowed under GAAP, the Company’s U.S. qualified pension plan's impact on earnings is determined using Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years and therefore reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.
•Business Combinations - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other advisors to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
During fiscal 2021, Energizer used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of the amortizable intangible assets acquired for the Formulations Acquisition. The Company utilized multi-period excess earnings methods for determining the fair value of the proprietary technology and customer relationships acquired. Our determination of the fair value of these assets involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships also involved assumptions related to customer attrition rates.
•Intangible Assets - Significant judgment is required in assigning the respective useful lives of intangible assets. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The carrying value of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company assesses the appropriateness of an indefinite life being assigned to certain intangible assets as a part of this annual impairment analysis. The useful life of a determinable-
lived intangible asset would be reassessed if a triggering event was identified that indicated a potential change in the value or use of our determinable-lived assets. A change in the useful life of these assets could have a material impact on our financial statements.
The Company has certain trade names with indefinite lives that are reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the trade name may be impaired. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company can elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, and is then required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a quantitative assessment was performed over the Armor All, STP and Rayovac trade names, resulting in non-cash impairments of $370.4, $26.3 and $127.8, respectively. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and are included within the cash flow models, a decrease in the branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The quantitative estimated fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG&A, R&D and A&P), and discount rates. The projections for the Armor All, STP and Rayovac fair value models are generated using the Company’s three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and management’s expectations for future growth by brand and category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. Operating expenses are based on historical trends and management's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, as well as long-term operating and advertising strategies. The discount rates used in the trade name fair value estimates ranged between 9.5% and 10.0%, and are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. The new carrying values for Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names are $228.5, $76.4, and $422.2, respectively.
Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could result in additional impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could also result in material impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, (iii) failure to meet forecasted operating expenses, or (iv) increases in the discount rate. Specifically, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an increase to the trade name impairment of approximately $48.
STP is within the fuel and oil additives category and due to the current expectation for an increased percentage of electric vehicles in the car parc over the long term, the Company has converted the STP trade name into a definite-life intangible asset with a 25 year useful life. This conversion will result in additional pre-tax amortization expense of approximately $3.0 in fiscal 2023.
Finally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a qualitative analysis was performed over the Energizer, Eveready and Varta trade names and no impairments were identified. These indefinite lived intangible assets have a combined carrying value of $111.8.
For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company completed the annual assessments and no impairments were identified.
•Goodwill - In fiscal 2022, the Company changed its reportable segments and correspondingly reallocated goodwill to the new reporting units: Battery & Lights North America, Battery & Lights International, Auto Care North America and Auto Care International. The Company performed an assessment of goodwill at October 1, 2021 before the change in segments, noting no impairments identified. Goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit on October 1, 2021.
The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth fiscal quarter for each of these reporting units. As part of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company estimated the fair value of each reporting unit under the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow model which incorporates significant
estimates and assumptions, including future cash flows driven by revenue and gross margin projections and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows. The Company uses the three-year strategic plan, the annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data for the discounted cash flow model. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and management’s expectations for future growth by category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. The discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies.
As a part of the annual assessment, the Company identified a non-cash impairment of the Auto Care International reporting unit of $17.4. This non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and are included within the cash flow models, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate. There is no remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit after the non-cash impairment.
The Battery & Lights reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying values by more than 100%. The estimated fair value of the Auto Care North America reporting unit, which has a total of $134.2 of goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by 12%. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment, estimates and assumptions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units could result in impairment charges in future periods. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our reporting units, which also could result in impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, or (iii) increases in the discount rate. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially impact our financial statements in any given year. Specifically, for the Auto Care North America reporting unit, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in the fair value exceeding the carrying value by 5%.
While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized, and also on the magnitude of any such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from these projections. The Company will monitor any changes to these assumptions and will evaluate goodwill as deemed warranted during future periods.
For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company completed the annual assessments and no impairments were identified.
•Income Taxes - The Company's annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.
In determining whether a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets are warranted, the Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. After the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, the conclusion was that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate enough future taxable income to realize the U.S. net deferred tax asset on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Company will continue to regularly assess the
potential for realization of net deferred tax assets in future periods. Changes in future earnings projections, among other factors, may result in a valuation allowance against some or all of the net deferred tax assets, which may materially impact income tax expense in the period if it is determined that these factors have changed.
The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly. The Company's policy on accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income is to treat the taxes due as a period expense when incurred.
In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. No provision has been provided for taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the United States. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 7, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
