General Overview
In evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, our primary area of focus is on our operating income. Revenue from lease type contracts includes all gross customer collections derived from our leased locations (net of local taxes), whereas revenue from management type contracts only includes our contractually agreed upon management fees and amounts attributable to ancillary services. Gross customer collections at facilities under management type contracts, therefore, are not included in our revenue. Accordingly, while a change in the proportion of our operating agreements that are structured as lease type contracts may cause significant fluctuations in reported revenue and cost of services, those changes will not artificially affect our gross profit. For example, as of December 31, 2021, 86% of our commercial business was operating under management type contracts. Only 64% of total revenue (excluding reimbursed management type contract revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2021, however, was from management type contracts. Under those contracts, the revenue collected from customers belongs to our clients.
We believe that sophisticated clients (which also include property owners) recognize the potential for technology-driven mobility solutions, parking services, parking management, ground transportation services, baggage handling services and other ancillary services to be a profit generator and/or a service differentiator to their customers. By outsourcing these services, they are able to capture additional profit and improve customer experiences by leveraging the unique operational skills and controls that an experienced services company can offer. Our ability to consistently deliver a uniformly high level of services to our clients, including the use of various technological enhancements, allows us to maximize the profit and/or customer experience to our clients and improves our ability to win contracts and retain existing clients. Our focus on customer service and satisfaction is a key driver of our high retention rate, which was approximately 91% and 87% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the Commercial segment.
Commercial Segment Facilities
In order to mitigate some of the effects from COVID-19, we converted many of our lease locations to management locations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. In addition, we were able to exit many less profitable contracts, which were for both lease and management locations. The following table reflects our Commercial facilities (by contractual type) operated at the end of the years indicated:
Revenue
We recognize services revenue from our contracts and certain fees for using our technology-driven mobility solutions as the related services are provided. Substantially all of our revenue comes from the following two sources:
Lease type contracts. Consists of all revenue received at lease type locations, including gross receipts (net of local taxes), consulting and real estate development fees, gains on sales of contracts and payments for exercising termination rights. As discussed in Note 4. Revenue in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue from lease type contracts includes a reduction for certain expenses (primarily rent expense) related to service concession arrangements.
Management type contracts. Consists of management fees, including fixed, variable and/or performance-based fees, and amounts attributable to ancillary services such as accounting, equipment leasing, baggage services, payments received for exercising termination rights, consulting, developmental fees, gains on sales of contracts, insurance and other value-added services. We believe we generally can purchase required insurance at lower rates than our clients can obtain on their own because we effectively self-insure for all liability and worker’s compensation and health care claims by maintaining a large per-claim deductible. As a result, we have generated operating income on the insurance provided under our management type contracts by focusing on our risk management efforts and controlling losses. Management type contract revenues do not include gross customer collections at those facilities, as those revenues belong to the client rather than to us. Management type contracts generally provide us with a management fee regardless of the operating performance of the underlying facility.
Reimbursed Management Type Contract Revenue. Consists of the direct reimbursement from the client for operating expenses incurred under a management type contract, which are reflected in our revenue.
Cost of Services (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)
Our cost of services consists of the following:
Lease type contracts. Consists of contractual rents or fees paid to the client and all operating expenses incurred in connection with operating the leased facility. Contractual rents or fees paid to the client are generally based on either a fixed contractual amount, a percentage of gross revenue or a combination thereof. Generally, under a lease type arrangement we are not responsible for major capital expenditures or real estate taxes.
Management type contracts. Cost of services under a management type contract is generally the responsibility of the client. As a result, these costs are not included in our results of operations. However, our reverse management type contracts, which typically provide for larger management fees, do require us to pay for certain costs and those costs are included in our results of operations.
Reimbursed Management Type Contract Expense. Consists of directly reimbursed costs incurred on behalf of a client under a management type contract, which are reflected in our cost of services.
Gross Profit
Gross profit equals our revenue less the cost of generating such revenue (“cost of services”). This is one of the key metrics we use to examine our performance because it captures the underlying economic benefit to us of both lease and management type contracts.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include salaries, wages, payroll taxes, insurance, travel and office related expenses for our headquarters, field offices and supervisory employees.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation is determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes, or in the case of leasehold improvements, over the initial term of the operating lease or its useful life, whichever is shorter. Intangible assets determined to have finite lives, usually acquired through the acquisition of businesses, are amortized over their remaining estimated useful lives.
Operating Income (Loss)
Operating income represents gross profit less general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. This is the key metric our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) uses for making decisions, assessing performance and allocating resources to our Operating Segments, Commercial and Aviation.
Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, net
See Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, which describes our policy relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, net.
Goodwill
Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, revenues for certain markets in which we operate decreased significantly during 2020 as compared to the expectations as of the October 1, 2019 annual impairment test. In addition, certain Aviation contracts were terminated during August 2020. The termination of these contracts and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our expected future operating cash flows triggered us to complete a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for our Aviation reporting unit as of August 31, 2020. Based on the quantitative analysis, we determined that the estimated carrying value exceeded implied fair value for the Aviation reporting unit and goodwill was impaired. No impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 10. Goodwill in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Other Intangibles Assets, net
As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our expected future operating cash flows, we determined certain impairment testing triggers had occurred related to our Proprietary know how intangible assets within the Aviation segment as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, we analyzed undiscounted cash flows for these intangible assets as of June 30, 2020. Based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, we determined that estimated net carrying values exceeded undiscounted future cash flows for certain Proprietary know how intangible assets and therefore, as of June 30, 2020, certain Proprietary know how assets were impaired.
Additionally, as a result of the termination of certain contracts within the Aviation reporting unit during August 2020 and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our expected future operating cash flows, we determined certain impairment testing triggers had occurred related to our customer relationships and trade names and trademarks intangible assets. Accordingly, we analyzed undiscounted cash flows for these intangible assets as of August 31, 2020. Based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, we determined that estimated net carrying values exceeded undiscounted future cash flows for certain customer relationships and trade names and trademarks intangible assets and therefore as of August 31, 2020, certain customer relationships and trade names and trademarks intangible assets were impaired. See Note 9. Other Intangible Assets, net in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
For both goodwill and intangible assets, future events may indicate differences from our judgments and estimates which could, in turn, result in impairment charges. Future events that may result in impairment charges include extended unfavorable economic impacts of COVID-19, increases in interest rates, which would impact discount rates, or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities, such as increasing labor and benefit costs.
Long-Lived Assets
See Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, which describes our policy relating to other long-lived assets.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we determined certain impairment triggers had occurred for certain right-of-use (“ROU”) assets. See Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies and Practices and Note 2. Leases in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Assumptions and estimates used to determine cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any future changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups and could result in additional impairment charges. Future events that may result in impairment charges include extended unfavorable economic impacts of COVID-19, or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities, such as increasing labor and benefit costs.
Segments
An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by our CODM. Our CODM is our chief executive officer. The CODM uses this separate discrete financial information by segment to allocate resources and assess performance, primarily based on operating income.
Our operating segments are Commercial and Aviation, which are described below.
•
Commercial encompasses our services in healthcare facilities, municipalities, including meter revenue collection and enforcement services, government facilities, hotels, commercial real estate, residential communities, retail, colleges and universities, as well as ancillary services such as shuttle and ground transportation services, valet services, taxi and livery dispatch services and event planning, including shuttle and transportation services.
•
Aviation encompasses our services in aviation (e.g., airports, airline and certain hospitality clients with baggage and parking services), as well as ancillary services, which includes shuttle and ground transportation services, valet services, baggage handling, baggage repair and replacement, remote air check-in services, wheelchair assist services and other services.
The Other segment includes costs related to our operational support teams and costs related to common and shared infrastructure, including finance, accounting, information technology, human resources, procurement and purchasing, legal and corporate development.
In December 2021, due to our continued focus on managing costs as a result of COVID-19, we changed our internal metric for how the CODM evaluates the business to operating income. In addition, we changed our internal segment information reported to the CODM. Certain revenue and expenses previously reported under Other are now included in Commercial and Aviation. All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the Company’s current reporting structure.
Analysis of Results of Operations
As a result of COVID-19, we have executed on a strategy to successfully convert certain lease type contracts to management type contracts or terminate certain lease type contracts, which should provide a higher operating income over the contract term. In addition, for those locations that have remained leases, we have worked with landlords to receive rent concessions, receive cost concessions related to service concession arrangements or change lease terms to be more favorable to us. As COVID-19 subsides, we expect these concessions to decline.
New business relates to contracts that started during the current period. Contract terminations relate to contracts that have expired or terminated early during the current period but where we were operating the business in the comparative period presented. Conversions relate to contracts that were converted from lease type contracts to management type contracts after the prior year period.
2021 Compared to 2020
Consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included the following notable items:
(1)
Excludes Reimbursed management type contract revenue of $575.7 million and $537.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2)
Excludes Reimbursed management type contract expense of $575.7 million and $537.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Includes lease impairment of $3.6 million and $97.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Services revenue increased by $52.5 million, or 9.6%, attributable to the following:
•
Services revenue for lease type contracts increased $26.2 million, or 13.8%, primarily due to an increase in transient revenue as a result of improving business conditions as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was significantly impacted by COVID-19, partially offset by conversions and lower cost concessions related to service concession arrangements of $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $31.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
•
Services revenue for management type contracts increased $26.3 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to an increase in volume based management type contracts as a result of improving business conditions as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was significantly impacted by COVID-19 and revenue from conversions and new business, partially offset by $5.6 million of termination fees received during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to certain terminated Aviation contracts and contract terminations.
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $96.9 million, or 18.7%, attributable to the following:
•
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for lease type contracts decreased $24.4 million, or 12.5%, primarily due to conversions, lower rent expense and a decrease in overall net operating costs, partially offset by lower cost concessions related to rent concessions of $16.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
•
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for management type contracts increased $21.0 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to conversions and new business, partially offset by a decrease in overall net operating costs.
•
We recognized $3.6 million and $97.1 million of impairment charges related to operating lease ROU assets during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
General and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 3.3%, primarily related to higher compensation expenses, including performance based compensation, during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by lower restructuring and other costs, cost reduction initiatives and impairment charges of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to certain abandoned operating leases.
We recognized $135.3 million of impairment charges related to certain finite lived intangible assets and goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and the termination of certain Aviation contracts in August 2020, our projected future revenue, profitability and operating cash flows within the Aviation segment were expected to be lower than our prior projections. As a result, the implied fair value of certain asset groups related to finite lived intangible assets within the Aviation segment were lower than their carrying values, resulting in $75.8 million of impairment charges being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, based on the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis performed by us as of August 31, 2020, the estimated carrying value for the Aviation reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value, resulting in $59.5 million of goodwill impairment charges being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. No similar impairment charges were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our effective tax rate was 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the finalization of our 2020 U.S. Federal income tax return during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in a $2.0 million additional benefit related to the ability to carryback our 2020 U.S. Federal Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) to previous tax years that had a higher tax rate.
The following tables summarize our revenues (excluding reimbursed management type contract revenue), gross profit, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and operating income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Operating loss increased $164.2 million, or 333.1%, to $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $135.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the factors noted above, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of the impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other
Operating expenses within the Other segment decreased $3.9 million, or 6.3%, to $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expenses, including performance based compensation, and cost reduction initiatives during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by higher restructuring and other costs.
Analysis of Financial Condition
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
We continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our operating needs can include, among other items, commitments for cost of services, operating leases, payroll, insurance claims, interest and legal settlements. Our investing and financing spending can include payments for acquired businesses, joint ventures, capital expenditures, distributions to noncontrolling interests, share repurchases and payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $163.9 million of borrowing availability under our Senior Credit Facility (as defined below). COVID-19 and the resulting global disruptions have negatively affected the global economy, as well as our business and the businesses of our customers and clients. The full impact of COVID-19 on our business and the businesses of our customers and clients is unknown and highly unpredictable and could continue beyond the containment of COVID-19. In order to lessen the impacts from COVID-19, we have taken actions to improve our liquidity, including, without limitation, by reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures, suspending repurchases of our common stock and maximizing the NOL on our 2020 U.S. Federal income tax return in order to carry back the loss to previous years that had a higher tax rate. Based on these actions and our expectations regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we believe we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations and remain in compliance with our existing debt covenants for the next twelve months.
Outstanding Indebtedness
As of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of approximately $324.0 million, a decrease of $38.1 million from $362.1 million as of December 31, 2020. The $324.0 million included:
•
$300.1 million under our Senior Credit Facility; and
•
$23.9 million of other debt, including finance lease obligations.
Senior Credit Facility
On February 16, 2021 (the “Fourth Amendment Effective Date”), we entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to our credit agreement (as amended prior to the Fourth Amendment Effective Date (as defined below), the “Credit Agreement”). Prior to the Fourth Amendment Effective Date and pursuant to the third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, which was entered into on May 6, 2020, the Senior Credit Facility permitted aggregate borrowings of $595.0 million consisting of (i) a revolving credit facility of up to $370.0 million at any time outstanding, which includes a letter of credit facility that is limited to $100.0 million at any time outstanding, and (ii) a term loan facility of $225.0 million (the entire principal amount of which we drew on November 30, 2018). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement as amended by the Fourth Amendment (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility decreased by $45.0 million to $325.0 million.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum based on our consolidated total debt to EBITDA ratio for the 12-month period ending as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, determined in accordance with (i) the applicable pricing levels set forth in the Credit Agreement (the “Applicable Margin”) for London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) loans, subject to a “floor” on LIBOR of 1.00%, or a comparable or successor rate to LIBOR approved by Bank of America, plus the applicable LIBOR rate, or (ii) the Applicable Margin for base rate loans plus the highest of (x) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (y) the Bank of America prime rate and (z) a daily rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, except that the Fourth Amendment provided that, for the period from May 6, 2020 until the date on which we deliver a compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022, (i) the interest rate applicable to both the term loan and revolving credit facilities was fixed at LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum and (ii) the per annum rate applicable to unused revolving credit facility commitments was fixed at 0.375% (the “Fixed Margin Rates”).
Also pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, (a) we were subject to a Minimum Liquidity test (as described in the Amended Credit Agreement) that required us to have liquidity of at least $40.0 million at each of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and (b) we are subject to a requirement that, at any time cash on hand exceeds $40.0 million for a period of three consecutive business days, we must repay revolving loans in an amount equal to such excess. Certain other negative and financial covenants were amended, which included restrictions on certain Investments, Permitted Acquisitions, Restricted Payments and Prepayments of Subordinated Debt (each as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), through the delivery of the compliance certificate for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022, as applicable.
As of December 31, 2021, under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, we were required to maintain a maximum consolidated total debt to EBITDA ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Fourth Amendment) of not greater than 4.75:1.0 (with certain step-downs described in the Amended Credit Agreement). In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we were required to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed coverage ratio of not less than 3.0:1:0 (with certain step-ups described in the Amended Credit Agreement).
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred approximately $1.2 million for fees and other customary closing costs in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement.
Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, term loans under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to scheduled quarterly payments of principal in installments equal to 1.875% of the initial aggregate principal amount of such term loan.
Events of default under the Amended Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, the occurrence of any cross default event, non-compliance with other loan documents, the occurrence of a change of control event, and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
Each of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement) has guaranteed all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and the Company arising under the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement and such domestic subsidiaries’ guaranty obligations are secured by substantially all of their respective assets. The Senior Credit Facility matures on November 30, 2023. The proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility may be used to finance working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, as well as for other general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Agreement did not change the guarantors, collateral, maturity date or permitted uses of proceeds, except as otherwise described above.
We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $163.9 million of borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement, of which we could have borrowed $163.5 million on December 31, 2021 and remained in compliance with the above described covenants as of such date. Our borrowing availability under the Amended Credit Agreement is limited only as of our fiscal quarter-end by the covenant restrictions described above. At December 31, 2021, we had $46.4 million letters of credit outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility and borrowings against the Senior Credit Facility aggregated to $302.1 million (excluding debt discount of $0.5 million and deferred financing costs of $1.5 million).
Stock Repurchases
On March 10, 2020, we suspended stock repurchases in order to help improve liquidity in response to the impacts of COVID-19.
In July 2019, the Board authorized us to repurchase, on the open market, shares of our outstanding common stock in an amount not to exceed $50.0 million in aggregate. Under this program, we repurchased 393,375 shares of common stock at an average price of $38.78 during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 652,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $38.88 under this program.
In March 2020, the Board authorized a new program to repurchase, on the open market, shares of our outstanding common stock in an amount not to exceed $50.0 million in aggregate. We have not repurchased shares under this program.
Since commencement, under all common stock repurchase programs, we have repurchased 2,034,742 shares of common stock through December 31, 2021. The remaining authorized amounts in the aggregate under the July 2019 and March 2020 repurchase programs as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:
Letters of Credit
We provided letters of credit totaling $13.2 million and $14.4 million to our casualty insurance carriers to collateralize our casualty insurance program as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We provided $33.2 million and $34.6 million in letters of credit to collateralize other obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Interest Rate Collars
In May 2019, we entered into three-year interest rate collar contracts with an aggregate $222.3 million notional amount. The interest rate collars are used to manage interest rate risk associated with variable interest rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate collars establish a range where we will pay the counterparties if the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate falls below the established floor rate, and the counterparties will pay us if the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate exceeds the established ceiling rate of 2.5%. The interest rate collars settle monthly through the termination date of April 2022. No payments or receipts are exchanged on the interest rate collar contracts unless interest rates rise above or fall below the pre-determined ceiling or floor rates. The notional amount amortized consistently with the term loan portion of the Senior Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement prior to the Third Amendment. The interest rate collars were classified as cash flow hedges through May 5, 2020. On May 6, 2020, concurrent with entering into the Third Amendment, we de-designated the three-year interest rate collars. Prior to de-designation, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the collars was reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon de-designation, the balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is being reclassified to Other expense (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) on a straight-line basis through April 2022, which is over the remaining life for which the interest rate collars had previously been designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the collars after de-designation are included within Other expense (income) in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, $2.5 million and $1.6 million of interest was paid related to the interest rate collars, respectively.
We do not enter into derivative instruments for any speculative purposes.
Daily Cash Collections
As a result of day-to-day activity at our parking locations, we collect significant amounts of cash. Lease type contract revenue is generally deposited into our local bank accounts, with a portion remitted to our clients in the form of rental payments according to the terms of the leases. Under management type contracts, clients may require us to deposit the daily receipts into one of our local bank accounts, with the cash in excess of our operating expenses and management fees remitted to the clients at negotiated intervals. Other clients may require us to deposit the daily receipts into client designated bank accounts and the clients then reimburse us for operating expenses and pay our management fee subsequent to month-end. Our working capital and liquidity may be adversely affected if a significant number of our clients require us to deposit all parking revenues into their respective accounts.
Our liquidity also fluctuates on an intra-month and intra-year basis depending on the contract mix and timing of significant cash payments. Additionally, our ability to utilize cash deposited into our local accounts is dependent upon the availability and movement of that cash into our corporate accounts. For all these reasons, from time to time, we carry a significant cash balance, while also utilizing our Senior Credit Facility.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We had cash and cash equivalents of $15.7 million and $13.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cash balances reflect our ability to utilize funds deposited into our bank accounts. Availability, timing of deposits and the subsequent movement of cash into our corporate bank accounts may result in significant changes to our cash balances.
Summary of Cash Flows
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and availability under our Senior Credit Facility. Our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $13.2 million to $53.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 from $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from higher operating income, net of non-cash related items, due to improving business conditions, partially offset by the early repayment of deferred FICA taxes during the year ended December 31, 2021 and our significant efforts during March 2020 to control working capital to prepare for the uncertainty of COVID-19.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $35.8 million to $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $76.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital management.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.4 million from $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the noncontrolling interest buyout of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as discussed below. Cash used to purchase leasehold improvements and equipment was $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting our continued investment in technology initiatives during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities was $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.0 million from $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used in to purchase leasehold improvements, equipment and cost of contracts was $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold investments and equipment for $1.2 million and bought out a minority partner for $1.7 million as part of our decision to convert our agreement with Bradley International Airport to a standard management type agreement.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $42.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.4 million from $39.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher payments on debt during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by the repurchases of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020 that were suspended in March 2020.
Net cash used in financing activities was $39.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $40.4 million from $79.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock and lower net payments on the Senior Credit Facility.
Summary Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The following table summarizes certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We do not have significant short-term purchase obligations.
(1)
Represents minimum rental commitments, excluding (i) contingent rent provisions under all non-cancelable leases; and (ii) sublease income of $2.5 million.
(2)
Represents lease type contracts that meet the definition of service concession arrangements under Topic 853.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies and estimates as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates.
This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are included in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies and Practices in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules."
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") authoritative accounting guidance on goodwill, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances change that could cause goodwill to become impaired. We have elected to assess the impairment of goodwill annually on October 1 or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level; our reporting units represent our operating segments, consisting of Commercial and Aviation. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the use of acquired assets or our business strategy, and significant negative industry or economic trends.
We may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The determination of fair value of a reporting unit utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels, comparable marketplace data, comparable company market valuations, assumed discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors, all of which involve the use of significant judgement and estimates. We also assess critical areas that may impact our business including economic conditions, market related exposures, competition, changes in service offerings and changes in key personnel.
Other intangible assets represent assets with finite lives that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful life of other intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives. In addition, other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of intangibles are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.
Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets, including ROU assets, leasehold improvements, equipment and construction in progress, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified in order to measure an impairment. Events or circumstances that would result in an impairment review include a significant change in the use of an asset, the planned sale or disposal of an asset, or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the asset or asset group is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.
Assumptions and estimates used to determine cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any future changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in additional impairment charges. Future events that may result in impairment charges include extended unfavorable economic impacts of COVID-19, or other factors, which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations.
Insurance Reserves
We purchase comprehensive casualty insurance covering certain claims that arise in connection with our operations. In addition, we purchase umbrella/excess liability coverage. Under the various liability and workers' compensation insurance policies, we are obligated to pay directly or reimburse the insurance carrier for the deductible / retention amount of each loss covered by our general / garage, automobile, workers' compensation and garage keepers legal liability policies. As a result, we are effectively self-insured for all claims within the deductible / retention amount of each loss. Any loss over the deductible / retention is the responsibility of the third-party insurer. We apply the provisions as defined in the guidance related to accounting for contingencies, in determining the timing and amount of expense recognition associated with claims against us. The expense recognition is based upon our determination of an unfavorable outcome of a claim being deemed as probable and capable of being reasonably estimated, as defined in the guidance related to accounting for contingencies. This determination requires the use of judgment in both the estimation of probability and the amount to be recognized as an expense. We utilize historical claims experience and exposures specific to each type of insurance, along with actuarial methods performed quarterly by a third party actuarial adviser in determining the required level of insurance reserves. As of December 31, 2021, the insurance reserve for general, garage, automobile and workers’ compensation liabilities was $47.6 million, of which $20.0 million and $27.6 million was recorded in Accrued and other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future information regarding historical loss experience may require changes to the level of insurance reserves and could result in increased expense recognition in the future.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, primarily using a review of specific accounts, as well as historical collection trends and aging of receivables, and record adjustments to the allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense involves our judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate. The current open issues are not dissimilar from historical items.
Deferred income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, such that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible temporary differences between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws and tax rates in effect for the periods in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse or be settled. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period plus the change during the period in deferred income taxes. We have certain state NOL carry forwards which expire in 2041. We consider a number of factors in our assessment of the recoverability of our NOL carryforwards including their expiration dates and the limitations imposed due to the change in ownership, as well as future projections of income. Future changes in our operating performance, along with these considerations, may significantly impact the amount of NOLs ultimately recovered, and our assessment of their recoverability.
When evaluating our tax positions, we account for uncertainty in income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on only the technical merits of the position and the weight of available evidence. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, which is more than 50% likely of being realized, the benefit of that position is not recognized in our financial statements. The second step is measurement of the tax benefit. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not of being realized, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We are subject to claims and litigation in the normal course of our business, including those related to labor and employment, contracts, personal injury and other related matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages and claims. Some of these actions may be brought as class actions on behalf of a class or purported class of employees. While the outcomes of claims and legal proceedings brought against us are subject to uncertainty, we believe the final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We accrue a charge when we determine that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss, and if material, disclose the estimated range. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted. Estimating the probability that a loss will occur and estimating the amount of a loss or a range of loss involves significant estimation and judgment.
