Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of forward-looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years with 52 weeks and some with 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were comprised of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2022 will also be comprised of 52 weeks.
Operating Results Summary
The following are the results from 2021 that we believe are key indicators of our financial condition and results of operations when compared to 2020.
•Net sales decreased $48.6 million, or 0.8%.
•Comparable sales for stores open at least fifteen months, plus our e-commerce operations, decreased $152.2 million, or 2.5%.
•Gross margin dollars decreased $100.4 million and gross margin rate decreased 130 basis points to 39.0% of net sales.
•Selling and administrative expenses increased $49.1 million, which included $5.0 million of store asset impairment charges. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 110 basis points to 32.8% of net sales.
•Operating profit decreased $616.7 million to $239.8 million.
•Diluted earnings per share decreased 66.9% to $5.33 per share, compared to $16.11 per share in 2020.
•In 2020 we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of distribution centers of $463.1 million and consulting and other expenses of $4.0 million related to the sale and leaseback of our four owned distribution centers. The absence of the gain on sale of distribution centers and associated consulting and other expenses decreased our operating profit in 2021 by $459.1 million and decreased our diluted earnings per share by approximately $8.75 per share.
•Our return on invested capital decreased to 14.9% from 48.4%.
•Inventory of $1,237.8 million represented a $297.5 million increase, or 31.6%, from 2020.
•We acquired a total of 7.7 million of our outstanding common shares for $417.7 million under our share repurchase authorizations in 2021 compared to 3.8 million of our outstanding common shares for $172.8 million under share repurchase authorizations in 2020.
•We declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.30 per common share, for a total paid amount of $41.7 million.
The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales:
See the discussion below under the caption “2021 Compared To 2020” for additional details regarding the specific components of our operating results. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2021 for a comparison of our operating results for 2020 to our operating results for 2019, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021.
In 2021, we recognized non-cash store asset impairments of $5.0 million related to underperforming stores in our chain, which included impairments of both operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. The store asset impairment charges decreased our operating profit by $5.0 million and decreased our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.11 per share. See Note 2 and Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the store asset impairment charges.
In 2020, we recognized a gain on sale of distribution centers of $463.1 million related to the sale and leaseback of four distribution centers. Additionally, our selling and administrative expenses include $4.0 million of consulting and other costs associated with the sale and leaseback transactions. The combined gain on sale of distribution centers and associated consulting and other expenses increased our operating profit by $459.1 million and increased our diluted earnings per share by approximately $8.75 per share. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale and leaseback transactions.
In 2019, our cost of sales included a $6.0 million charge for impairment of inventory in our greeting cards department, which we chose to exit in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, our selling and administrative expenses included $38.3 million of costs associated with our transformational restructuring initiative, which we refer to as “Operation North Star,” announced in the first quarter of 2019 and $7.3 million in estimated costs associated with employee wage and hour claims brought against us in the state of California. We also recognized a gain on sale of distribution center of $178.5 million related to the sale of our Rancho Cucamonga, CA distribution center which increased our 2019 operating profit by $178.5 million and increased our diluted earnings per share by approximately $3.47 per share. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this sale transaction.
Operating Strategy
In 2019, the Company completed a comprehensive review of its operating strategy. The outcome of the review was a multi-year plan for a strategic transformation, which we refer to as “Operation North Star.” While the core objectives of Operation North Star have remained the same, Operation North Star continues to evolve as our business progresses.
Operation North Star
Operation North Star has three primary objectives:
•Drive profitable long-term growth;
•Fund the journey; and
•Create long-term shareholder value.
Drive profitable long-term growth
The “drive profitable long-term growth” objective of Operation North Star is focused on growing our net sales, which includes:
•Growing our store count by:
◦Adding at least 50 net new stores in 2022;
◦Accelerating annual net new store growth beyond 2022 to 80 or more per year; and
◦Reducing store closures through our store intervention program for underperforming stores.
•Increasing our sales productivity by:
◦Optimizing our assortments through category discipline and space planning;
◦Introducing a new Furniture associate program, which we refer to as NextGen Furniture Sales, to accelerate Furniture net sales growth;
◦Growing Furniture net sales with modern Broyhill® brand assortments;
◦Winning with year-round Seasonal assortments;
◦Expanding our rapidly-growing apparel offering;
◦Growing our own brands, especially our Broyhill® and Real Living® brands; and
◦Driving our merchandising innovation pipeline by responsibly investing in store presentation initiatives, including “The Lot,” the “Queue Line,” and Project Refresh (described below).
•Accelerating our e-commerce sales by:
◦Removing friction points to provide an easier shopping experience;
◦Increasing website personalization with product recommendations;
◦Accelerating supplier direct fulfillment and extending our assortment;
◦Growing site traffic through targeted marketing and brand growth; and
◦Improving shipping options to include nationwide same-day and two-day delivery options.
•Activating our brand and growing our customer base by:
◦Creating a community of bargain hunters and treasure seekers;
◦Driving incremental visits from new and existing customers;
◦Increasing brand awareness, brand consideration, and customers; and
◦Driving personalized marketing based on our customer data platform.
Fund the journey
The “fund the journey” objective of Operation North Star is focused on reducing costs so we can invest these savings generated by the cost reduction initiatives in the growth areas of our business. Our initiatives include:
•Expanding our gross margin rate;
•Increasing store efficiency and productivity;
•Increasing organizational efficiency;
•Encouraging a culture of frugality; and
•Continuously analyzing our purchasing habits and vendor agreements to ensure we are maximizing our buying power and making cost-effective decisions.
Create long-term shareholder value
The “create long-term shareholder value” objective represents the culmination of our “drive profitable long-term growth” and “fund the journey” objectives. If we effectively execute the first two objectives of Operation North Star, we believe that we will deliver value to our shareholders through earnings growth over time. We continue to optimize our capital allocation to support Operation North Star initiatives while returning capital to our shareholders though share repurchases and dividends, when appropriate.
Enablers
In recognition of the importance of having the appropriate technology and processes in place to achieve our “drive profitable long-term growth” and “fund the journey” objectives, we have established several enabler work streams with the following objectives:
•Improve our customer experience;
•Improve and scale our supply chain capabilities;
•Upgrade and enhance our data and technology foundation; and
•Elevate our talent acquisition and performance management.
Operation North Star Progress
In 2021, we successfully completed the following under our Operation North Star strategy:
•Grew our Broyhill® brand offerings to account for over $700 million of net sales in 2021;
•Increased our net store count by 23 stores, which is our third consecutive year of net store growth;
•Expanded our presentation initiatives, The Lot and Queue Line, to nearly all stores in our chain;
•Implemented a space planning tool, which improved our merchandising analytics and insights;
•Launched Project Refresh, a multi-year store investment to update the shopping experience and appearance of our older stores in a cost efficient manner, with approximately 50 stores completed in 2021;
•Opened two small-format forward distribution centers to expand our supply chain capabilities;
•Launched a new transportation management system for outbound shipments;
•Achieved an 82% favorable associate engagement rate, which exceeds our retail industry benchmark;
•Expanded our accepted payment methods to include Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and Pay in 4;
•Expanded our e-commerce distribution network by implementing ship-from-store capabilities in 18 additional stores;
•Invested in e-commerce analytics tools, which improved our testing capabilities and customer insights; and
•Returned approximately $460 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
Next Steps
In 2022, we plan to implement the following initiatives to achieve our Operation North Star goals:
•Grow our store count by at least 50 net new stores;
•Execute Project Refresh remodels in approximately 200 additional stores;
•Implement our NextGen Furniture Sales model in approximately 500 additional stores, which is intended to enhance staffing and incentive compensation to grow Furniture sales;
•Implement a new “Lots under $5” presentation initiative, which will provide incremental assortment at a highly-attractive price point;
•Expand shrink reduction programs, including cart locking systems and apparel tagging;
•Open two additional forward distribution centers and assess the need for additional forward distribution centers;
•Launch a multi-year project to overhaul our order management system to enable future growth opportunities;
•Implement buy online, ship to store capabilities; and
•Enhance e-commerce supply chain with last mile carrier capabilities and an improved ship from store network.
Merchandising
We focus our merchandising strategy on (1) the bargain hunt, by seeking to deliver unmatched value in all of our merchandise categories; (2) the treasure hunt, by seeking to surprise and delight our customers with our unique product assortment; and (3) convenience, by seeking to offer a reliable assortment of simple to shop essentials. In 2021, we introduced the concept of “Big Buys” to our merchandising strategy. Big Buys include closeouts and other one-time product offerings that fit into the bargain hunt facet of our merchandising strategy.
One of the focuses of Operation North Star is driving growth in our own brands, particularly the Broyhill® brand, an iconic brand that we acquired in 2018. We launched the Broyhill® brand of product offerings in late 2019 with initial product offerings in our Furniture, Seasonal, Soft Home, and Hard Home merchandise categories. We expanded the Broyhill® line in 2021 to also include housewares and kitchen textiles. Available both in-store and online, we believe the Broyhill® assortment strengthens our Home assortment with a high-quality product offering at a value-based price that customers find attractive. Our Broyhill®-related net sales exceeded $700 million in 2021 compared to over $400 million in 2020. In 2022, we intend to focus on improving the availability of Broyhill® merchandise, which was negatively impacted by global supply chain issues in 2021 that, in turn, negatively impacted the growth of our Broyhill®-related net sales.
We believe our merchandising strategies for Furniture, Seasonal, and Soft Home position us to surprise and delight our customers with our home product offerings:
•Our Furniture category primarily focuses on being a destination for our core customer’s home furnishing needs, such as upholstery, mattresses, case goods, and ready-to-assemble. In Furniture, we believe our competitive advantage is attributable to our sourcing relationships, our in-store availability, our delivery options, and everyday value offerings. A significant majority of our offerings in this category consist of replenishable products sold under our own brands or sourced from recognized brand-name manufacturers. Within our own brands portfolio, the Broyhill® branded product offerings feature elevated quality and value, which continues to attract new furniture customers as well as provide existing customers with an incentive to step up to the higher-end offering. Our long-standing relationships with brand-name manufacturers, most notably in our mattresses and upholstery departments, allow us to work directly with the manufacturers to create product offerings exclusively for us, which enables us to provide a high-quality product at a competitive price. Additionally, we believe our “buy today, take home today” practice of carrying in-stock inventory of our core furniture offerings, which allows our customer to take home their purchase at the end of their shopping experience, positively differentiates us from our competition. As an omnichannel retailer, we also encourage our customer to shop and buy our products online anytime and anywhere, and we invite customers into our stores to touch and feel the quality and comfort of our products. Additionally, customers can have furniture delivered to their door same-day through PICKUP®, our national delivery partner. We believe that offering a focused assortment, which is displayed in furniture vignettes, provides customers a solution for decorating their home when combined with our home décor offerings. Supplementing our merchandising and presentation strategies, we provide multiple third-party financing options for our customers, including options for those who may be more challenged for approval in traditional credit channels. Our financing partners are solely responsible for the credit approval decisions and carry the financial risk.
•Our Seasonal category strengthens our home offerings with our patio furniture, gazebos, Christmas trim, and other holiday departments. We believe we have a competitive advantage in this category by offering trend-right products with a strong value proposition in our own brands. Our stores focus on displaying assembled seasonal product to showcase our quality and value, with boxed stock located nearby, so it is easy for our customers to purchase and take home. Much of this merchandise is sourced on an import basis, which allows us to maintain our competitive pricing. Additionally, our Seasonal category offers surprise and delight through a mix of departments and products that meet our customer’s outdoor experience and holiday decorating desires. We continually work with our vendors to expand the product assortment in our Seasonal category to respond to our customers’ evolving wants and needs.
•Our Soft Home category complements our Furniture and Seasonal categories in making our stores a destination for a broader range of home needs. Over the past several years, we have enhanced our assortment in Soft Home by allocating more selling space to the category to support a wider range of replenishable, fashion-based products. We
have also grown our assortments of closeouts in Soft Home to bring exceptional value and unique finds to our customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in Soft Home as a result of our trend-right, focused assortment with improved quality and perceived value, and our ability to furnish our customers' homes with décor that complements an in-store furniture purchase. We have worked to develop a “solutions” approach to complete a room through our cross-merchandising efforts, particularly color palette coordination, when combining our Soft Home offerings with our Furniture and Seasonal categories. We believe that this approach helps our customers envision how the product can work in their homes and enhances our brand image.
We believe the Food, Consumables, Hard Home, and Apparel, Electronics, & Other are categories where we offer convenience and exceptional value:
•Our Food and Consumables categories focus primarily on providing everyday essentials with a consistent and convenient assortment and exceptional value through Big Buys, closeouts, and opening price point offerings. We believe we possess a competitive advantage in the Food and Consumables categories based on our sourcing capabilities for closeout merchandise. Manufacturers and vendors have closeout merchandise for a variety of different reasons, including other retailers canceling orders or going out of business, production overruns, or marketing or packaging changes. We believe our vendor relationships, along with our size and financial strength, afford us the opportunity to consistently source and deliver Big Buys. To supplement our closeout business, we have focused on improving and expanding our brand name, “never out” product assortment to offer more consistency in those convenience areas where our customers desire consistently available everyday product offerings, such as over-the-counter medications. We believe that we have added top brands to our “never out” programs in Consumables and that our assortment and value proposition will continue to differentiate us in this highly competitive industry. In 2020, we reallocated space from the Food category to the Consumables category through our “Pantry Optimization” initiative, which right-sized our food assortment, including reducing our refrigerated foods, and allowed us to expand the “never out” Consumables assortment that our customer considers an every day essential. In 2021, we focused on providing surprise and delight by expanding our holiday Food and Consumables assortments, as well as launching a one dollar opening price point program, which we promoted as “Onederland.”
•We believe that our Hard Home and Apparel, Electronics, & Other categories serve as convenient adjacencies to our other merchandise categories. Over the past several years, with the exception of apparel, we have intentionally narrowed our assortments in these categories and reallocated space from these categories to our home products categories. These categories focus on value, and savings in comparison to competitors, in areas such as food prep, table top, home maintenance, small appliances, and electronics. In 2021, following a successful test and expansion in 2020, we rolled out apparel to the full chain and tested a successful presentation concept at the front of the store. In 2022, we continue to test and learn in our apparel presentation with a focus on sourcing closeouts and delivering Big Buys.
Our merchandising management team is aligned with our merchandise categories, and their primary goal is to increase our total company comparable sales (“comp” or “comps”), which includes stores open at least fifteen months, plus our e-commerce operations. Our review of the performance of the members of our merchandise management team focuses on comps by merchandise category, as we believe it is the key metric that will drive our long-term net sales. By focusing on strengthening our home product offerings, and managing our convenience categories, we believe our merchandise management team can effectively address the changing shopping behaviors of our customers and implement more focused offerings within each merchandise category, which we believe will lead to long-term comp growth.
Marketing
See the “Advertising and Marketing” discussion in Item 1. Business for a discussion on our Marketing strategy.
Shopping Experience
One of the core objectives of Operation North Star is to drive our merchandising innovation pipeline by responsibly investing in store presentation initiatives that create an easy shopping experience for our customers.
We have implemented a presentation solution called “The Lot” in nearly all of our stores over the past two years. We designed The Lot to display items from various merchandise categories placed in vignettes to promote life’s occasions, such as Fall tailgating. The Lot offers a treasure hunt by surprising and delighting our customers with the breadth and value of products that we offer in one convenient experience. The continually rotating product assortment offered by The Lot provides us with a unique testing ground for new products at varying price points that we have not historically offered.
We have also implemented a streamlined checkout experience in nearly all of our stores called the “Queue Line,” which features a reconfigured checkout design. The Queue Line both enhances the customer experience and builds a bigger basket as our customers walk by new and expanded convenience offerings as they check out. The Queue Line’s smaller overall footprint compared to our previous checkout configuration also creates additional selling space for our Furniture merchandise category.
In 2022, we will introduce a supplement to The Lot and Queue Line called “Lots Under $5,” which will sit in the front of our stores and is comprised of items priced less than $5 each that we expect will appeal to our bargain hunt and treasure hunt shoppers.
In 2021, we launched a multi-year project called Project Refresh, which is intended to make cosmetic improvements to older stores in our fleet and align branding across our stores. The investment for a Project Refresh remodel is expected to be less than $150,000 per store and includes updated exterior signage, vestibules, flooring, bathrooms, interior wall graphics, and paint. We completed approximately 50 Project Refresh remodels in 2021 in a successful test and we expect to remodel an additional 200 stores under Project Refresh in 2022. We expect to complete Project Refresh remodels in approximately 800 of our stores over the next several years, including the 50 completed in 2021 and the 200 planned in 2022.
In addition to our efforts to improve our in-store shopping experience, Operation North Star focuses on improving our e-commerce shopping experience and growing e-commerce net sales by removing barriers, creating a fun and easy experience, and expanding the items available for purchase online. Over the last few years, we have increased our “extended aisle” assortments on our e-commerce platform, which offer additional fabric and color options on products in our Furniture and Seasonal categories, including items only available online. In 2019, we launched our buy online, pick up in store (“BOPIS”) program nationwide, which has nearly doubled our merchandise offerings available online. Following the launch of our BOPIS program, we launched curbside pickup to supplement our BOPIS service, reduced shipping times by expanding our distribution network to include ship-from-store capabilities at 65 stores around the country, and introduced same-day delivery of all items available in our stores through our partnerships with Instacart® and PICKUP®. In 2021, we launched new payment types on our website including Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and “Pay in 4”. In 2022, we plan to further enhance our e-commerce shopping experience by removing friction at checkout, enhancing personalization with product recommendations, expanding our online product assortment, accelerating our use of supplier direct fulfillment, and implementing buy online, ship to store fulfillment capabilities.
Lastly, we continue to offer a private label credit card and our Easy Leasing lease-to-own solutions for customer financing, as well as protection plans on merchandise across stores and online. Our private label credit card provides access to revolving credit, through a third party, for use on both larger ticket items and daily purchases. Our Easy Leasing lease-to-own program provides a single use opportunity for access to third-party financing. Our protection plan program provides a method for obtaining multi-year warranty coverage for furniture, seasonal, mattresses, small appliances, large area rugs, and electronics purchased in-store or online.
Real Estate
Real estate development is a critical component of our Operation North Star strategy, which includes our objective of growing our store count. The following table compares the number of our stores in operation at the end of each of the last five fiscal years, and the associated square footage:
In 2021, we grew our net store count by 23 stores, which marks our third consecutive year of net store growth. Additionally, the average size of stores that we have opened or relocated over the past several years exceeds our existing average. As a result, our overall average selling square footage has increased. In 2022, we expect to open at least 50 net new stores. Looking beyond 2022, we anticipate accelerating our net new store growth to 80 or more stores per year. Our real estate team has identified more than 500 location opportunities in markets across the U.S. where we believe we can successfully open stores. Over the next several years, we plan to actively pursue those locations with the goal of significantly increasing our net sales and operating profit. Our new store selection process includes a thorough review of proforma estimated results prior to entering a
lease to help ensure the economic quality of our store openings, as well as a post-opening review that we use to improve our proforma development.
Part of our plan to grow net store count includes reducing our store closures. To reduce store closures, we have organized and implemented a store intervention program over the last two years that assesses underperforming stores. The store intervention program reviews various store performance metrics to identify underperforming stores for review, develops action plans for improvement, and then works with various business leaders and teams to implement the action plans. Action plans most often include changes in merchandising, marketing, staffing, and training, but can also include working with landlords and/or local officials to renegotiate rents or improve conditions surrounding the store, such as ingress/egress issues that have materialized since the store opened.
As discussed in “Item 2. Properties,” of this Form 10-K, we have 184 store leases that will expire in 2022. The majority of our 2022 closings will result from relocation of stores to improved locations within the same local market, with the balance of closings resulting from a lack of renewal options or from our belief that a location’s sales and operating profit volume are not strong enough to warrant additional investment in the location. As part of our evaluation of potential store closings, we consider our ability to transfer sales from a closing store to other nearby locations and generate a better overall financial result for the geographic market.
2021 COMPARED TO 2020
Net Sales
Net sales by merchandise category (in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales), net sales change (in dollars and percentage), and comps in 2021 compared to 2020 were as follows:
We periodically assess and make minor adjustments to our product hierarchy, which can impact the roll-up of our merchandise categories. In 2021, we realigned our merchandise categories and renamed our Electronics, Toys, & Accessories merchandise category as Apparel, Electronics, & Other. See the reclassifications discussion in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. In order to provide comparative results, we have reclassified our net sales into the revised merchandise category alignment for all periods presented.
Net sales decreased $48.6 million, or 0.8%, to $6,150.6 million in 2021, compared to $6,199.2 million in 2020. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by an overall comp decrease of 2.5%, which decreased net sales by $152.2 million. This decrease was partially offset by a $103.6 million increase in net sales from our non-comparable stores, driven by the net increase of 23 stores in 2021 and increased net sales in our new and relocated stores compared to our closed stores. Our comps and net sales decreased in 2021 in comparison to 2020 primarily due to a decreased impact of nesting trends and government stimulus funds on consumer behavior, and the negative impact of global and domestic supply chain constraints in 2021.
Net sales and comps in all of our merchandise categories were negatively impacted by global and domestic supply chain issues in 2021. These supply chain challenges impacted both imported products and domestically-sourced products, as our domestic vendors have faced similar supply chain challenges in sourcing raw materials. Domestically, our supply chain has also been impacted by labor challenges in certain of our distribution centers, with the majority of the impact in the northeast U.S. In response to labor challenges in our distribution centers, we increased wages and implemented attendance and retention programs to improve overall productivity. In the third quarter of 2021, we opened two small-format forward distribution centers (“FDCs”), which are designed to process bulky and full-pallet shipments, which have begun to relieve pressure from our regional distribution centers most impacted by labor challenges.
Our Seasonal category experienced increased comps and net sales in 2021 due to an increase in demand for our Seasonal category which we believe was initially driven by government stimulus and unemployment funds in the first quarter of 2021, together with the continuation of similar nesting trends to those we experienced in 2020 as a result of customers investing more time and discretionary funds in their home. Nesting trends in 2021 were skewed toward patio furniture, outdoor products, and seasonal decor, which drove increased net sales and comps in the lawn & garden and summer departments of our Seasonal merchandise category. Nesting trends abated in the second quarter of 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines became widely available and more consumers began traveling or spending more time outside their home compared to 2020. Despite the decrease in overall nesting behaviors, our Seasonal category continued to benefit from high demand in the third quarter of 2021 for outdoor furniture and seasonal decor late into the summer season and fall, which we were able to meet with higher inventory levels compared to 2020. The positive Seasonal trends continued into the fourth quarter as we experienced an increase in net sales and comps in our Christmas department, which was primarily driven by increased inventory levels in our Christmas products in 2021 compared to 2020. During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we intentionally reduced our Christmas inventory purchases due to demand uncertainty, which led to lower Christmas inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite the increased performance of our Seasonal category in 2021 compared to 2020, the Seasonal category was challenged by global and domestic supply chain issues throughout 2021 (discussed above), which resulted in delayed receipts of seasonally-sensitive merchandise.
Our Apparel, Electronics, & Other category also experienced increased comps and net sales in 2021 driven by our strategic initiatives, particularly The Lot and Queue Line, the product assortments of which fall into the Apparel, Electronics, & Other
category. We believe our product assortment in the Apparel, Electronics, & Other category is aligned with customer demand and that this category is a significant growth opportunity for us.
Our Furniture, Soft Home, and Hard Home categories experienced decreased net sales and comps in 2021 compared to 2020. While these categories benefited from government stimulus funds released in the first quarter of 2021, decreased nesting trends and supply chain impacts caused the decline in net sales and comps in the balance of 2021 compared to 2020. In the second half of 2021, our Furniture, Soft Home, and Hard Home categories were significantly impacted by out-of-stocks and low inventory levels in certain historically popular items due to global and domestic supply chain constraints. In particular, temporary factory shutdowns were a significant contributor to out-of-stocks that drove the decrease in our Furniture net sales and comps in 2021 compared to 2020. While our customers continue to respond well to our Broyhill® branded products and we grew our net sales and comps in the Broyhill® brand, these higher-price point items were impacted by supply chain challenges and low inventory levels.
Our Food and Consumables categories experienced decreases in net sales and comps in 2021 compared to 2020, due to a decrease in demand for essential products (which we define as food, consumables, health products, and pet supplies) and lower availability of name-brand product and closeout merchandise. Demand for essential products surged in the first quarter of 2020 as customers stocked up on these products at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our customers did not stock up on these products to the same extent in 2021. Due to the aforementioned supply chain challenges, the availability of name-brand merchandise that drives our Food and Consumables net sales and comps was limited and there were fewer closeout opportunities. In addition, we reallocated linear square footage from our Food category to our Consumables category in the third quarter of 2020 as part of our Pantry Optimization initiative. We continue to refine and adjust our Food and Consumables assortments to provide convenience and consistency to our customers.
Gross Margin
Gross margin dollars decreased $100.4 million, or 4.0%, to $2,397.0 million in 2021, compared to $2,497.4 million in 2020. The decrease in gross margin dollars was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin rate, which decreased gross margin dollars by $80.8 million, and a decrease in net sales, which decreased gross margin dollars by $19.6 million. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 130 basis points to 39.0% in 2021 compared to 40.3% in 2020. The gross margin rate decrease was primarily due to higher inbound freight costs, a higher shrink rate, and a lower initial markup compared to 2020. The decrease was partially offset by lower markdowns. Freight costs increased primarily due to higher ocean carriage rates, domestic transportation rates, and fuel costs, and detention and demurrage charges resulting from delayed receipt of inventory related to supply chain constraints. The shrink rate increased as a result of an increase in theft in our stores and the decreased sales compared to 2020. The lower initial markup compared to 2020 was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in freight costs. The lower markdowns was driven by less promotional activity in 2021 compared to 2020.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses were $2,014.7 million in 2021, compared to $1,965.6 million in 2020. The increase of $49.1 million, or 2.5%, was primarily due to increases in distribution and transportation costs of $59.4 million, share-based compensation expense of $13.4 million, store occupancy costs of $9.4 million, and health benefit costs of $9.3 million, as well as store asset impairment charges of $5.0 million, partially offset by decreases in bonus expense of $26.2 million, store-related payroll of $13.7 million, and advertising expense of $5.1 million, as well as the absence of $4.0 million of sale and leaseback related expenses and $3.7 million of proxy contest-related costs. The increase in distribution and transportation costs was driven by higher transportation costs, higher labor costs in our regional distribution centers, higher inbound and outbound volume as we worked to increase our inventory levels from the end of 2020 to the end of 2021, rent on our leased distribution centers, four of which were sold and leased back in the second quarter of 2020, the addition of two FDCs, and the addition of “pop-up” bypass distribution centers in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by the absence of a $2 per hour wage increase that was implemented for most of our non-exempt workforce beginning in March 2020 through June 2020 in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in share-based compensation expense was primarily due to a higher grant date fair value on the 2019 performance share units for which the grant date was established in 2021 compared to the 2018 performance share units for which the grant date was established in 2020 and performance share units granted in 2020. Our store occupancy costs increased primarily due to an increased store count in 2021, new stores opened in the last twelve months, which have higher rents than the stores closed, and normal rent increases resulting from lease renewals. Health benefit expense increased driven by an increase in health benefit claims in 2021 compared to the 2020, as many medical providers postponed elective care procedures in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The store asset impairment charges are comprised of operating lease right-of-use asset and property and equipment impairments for eight underperforming stores as a result of our store impairment review. The decrease in accrued bonus expense was driven by decreased performance in 2021 relative to our bonus targets as compared to our performance in 2020 relative to our bonus targets, as well as the absence of a one-time discretionary bonus granted in the second quarter of 2020 to recognize our non-exempt associates in our stores and distribution
centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in store-related payroll was primarily due to the absence of the aforementioned $2 per hour wage increase. Advertising expense decreased due to decreased investments in video media as we have taken a more targeted approach to our advertising spend. The sale and leaseback transaction-related expenses, which included consulting costs, were incurred in completing the sale and leaseback of our distribution centers in the second quarter of 2020. The proxy contest-related costs were comprised of legal, public relations, and advisory fees, and settlement costs incurred to resolve a proxy contest in the first quarter of 2020.
As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased by 110 basis points to 32.8% in 2021 compared to 31.7% in 2020.
Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense increased $4.3 million to $142.6 million in 2021 compared to $138.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by investments in our strategic initiatives, new stores, and supply chain improvements, partially offset by a decrease resulting from the sale of four distribution centers in the second quarter of 2020.
Depreciation expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 10 basis points compared to 2020.
Gain on Sale of Distribution Centers
Gain on sale of distribution centers decreased $463.1 million to $0 in 2021. The gain on sale of distribution centers in 2020 was attributable to the sale and leaseback of our distribution centers in Durant, OK; Tremont, PA; Montgomery, AL; and Columbus, OH during the second quarter of 2020.
Operating Profit
Operating profit was $239.8 million in 2021 compared to $856.5 million in 2020. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by the items discussed in the “Net Sales,” “Gross Margin,” “Selling and Administrative Expenses,” “Depreciation Expense,” and “Gain on Sale of Distribution Centers” sections above. In summary, the decrease in operating profit was driven by the absence of a gain on the sale of distribution centers, a decrease in net sales and gross margin rate, and increases in selling and administrative expenses and depreciation expense.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, to $9.3 million in 2021 compared to $11.0 million in 2020. The decrease in interest expense was driven by lower total average borrowings (including finance leases and the sale and leaseback financing liability). We had total average borrowings of $148.5 million in 2021 compared to total average borrowings of $257.6 million in 2020. The decrease in total average borrowings was driven by our repayment of all outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility following the sale and leaseback transactions completed in the second quarter of 2020, and our prepayment of our $70 million term note agreement (the “2019 Term Note”) in the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by the establishment of the financing liability in connection with the sale and leaseback transactions in the second quarter of 2020. In 2021, we experienced a higher average interest rate due to the higher rate on the sale and leaseback financing liability.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) was $1.3 million in 2021, compared to $(0.9) million in 2020. The change was primarily driven by gains on our diesel fuel derivatives in 2021 compared to losses on diesel fuel derivatives in 2020. The gains on diesel fuel derivatives in 2021 were partially offset by a $0.5 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2021 related to the prepayment of the 2019 Term Note.
Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate in 2021 and 2020 was 23.3% and 25.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the net tax benefit associated with settlement of share-based payment awards during 2021, partially offset by an increase in nondeductible executive compensation compared to 2020.
Known Trends and 2022 Guidance
We continue to face significant challenges as the global supply chain works to recover from the factory and port shutdowns in 2021 and as domestic labor shortages persist. We are facing a highly competitive domestic labor market, which we expect to result in increased payroll expenses for our stores and distribution centers in 2022. Additionally, in late 2021 and early 2022, the U.S. economy experienced its highest inflationary period in decades, which has adversely impacted costs in our business and adversely impacted the buying power of our customers. However, the U.S. has started to resume more normal day-to-day life as COVID-19 cases have subsided, which we expect will result in improved traffic in our stores. We have incorporated the expected impact of these trends into our guidance below.
At March 3, 2022, excluding consideration of potential share repurchase activity, we expected the following in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021:
•Comparable sales decrease in the low double digits;
•Gross margin rate decrease of approximately 50 bps;
•Selling and administrative expenses slightly above last year; and
•Diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
On September 22, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement, which provides for a $600 million five-year unsecured credit facility. The 2021 Credit Agreement expires on September 22, 2026. The 2021 Credit Agreement replaced the 2018 Credit Agreement, a $700 million five-year unsecured credit facility which we entered into on August 31, 2018 and was scheduled to expire on August 31, 2023, but was terminated concurrent with our entry into the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2021 Credit Agreement includes a $50 million swing loan sublimit, a $75 million letter of credit sublimit, a $75 million sublimit for loans to foreign borrowers, and a $200 million optional currency sublimit. The 2021 Credit Agreement also contains an environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) provision, which may provide favorable pricing and fee adjustments if we meet ESG performance criteria to be established by a future amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement. Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, we have the option to establish incremental term loans and/or increases in the revolving credit limits in an aggregate amount of up to $300 million, subject to the lenders agreeing to increase their commitments. Additionally, the 2021 Credit Agreement includes two options to extend the maturity date of the 2021 Credit Agreement by one year each, subject to each lender agreeing to extend the maturity date of its respective loans. The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2021 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating or leverage ratio, whichever results in more favorable pricing to us. The 2021 Credit Agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from multiple interest rate options. The interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or LIBOR for loans denominated in U.S. dollars or the Euro Short Term Rate (€STR) for loans denominated in Euros. The 2021 Credit Agreement updated the LIBOR fallback language to implement fallback provisions, pursuant to which the interest rate on the loans will transition to an alternative rate upon the occurrence of certain LIBOR cessation events. Loans made under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be prepaid without penalty. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios - a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenants of the 2021 Credit Agreement do not restrict our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, we are subject to cross-default provisions associated with any default on indebtedness that is greater than $50 million, including with respect to our synthetic lease for our distribution center in Apple Valley, CA, which was also amended concurrent with our entry into the 2021 Credit Agreement to conform to the covenants of the 2021 Credit Agreement. A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the 2021 Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2021 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement. At January 29, 2022 we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2021 Credit Agreement. At January 29, 2022, we had $3.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement, and the borrowings available under the 2021 Credit Agreement were $594.1 million, after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.4 million.
On August 7, 2019, we entered into the 2019 Term Note, a $70 million term note agreement, which was secured by the equipment at our Apple Valley, CA distribution center and carried a fixed interest rate of 3.3%. In light of our strong liquidity and market conditions at the time, we prepaid the remaining $44.3 million principal balance under the 2019 Term Note in the second quarter of 2021. In connection with the prepayment, we incurred a $0.4 million prepayment fee and recognized a $0.5 million loss on debt extinguishment in the second quarter of 2021.
The primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility, as necessary. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, and operating profit margins. Our cash provided by operations typically peaks in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year due to net sales generated during the holiday selling season. Generally, our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter as we build our inventory levels prior to the holiday selling season. We have historically funded those requirements with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facility. We expect to periodically borrow under the 2021 Credit Agreement during 2022 to fund our cash requirements. Cash requirements include among other things, capital expenditures, working capital needs, interest payments, and other contractual commitments.
At January 29, 2022 our material cash requirements, which are comprised of written purchase orders, cancellable and noncancellable contractual commitments, and other obligations, were $1,683.7 million for the upcoming fiscal year and $4,654.7 million in total. Excluding operating lease and finance lease obligations disclosed in the Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, our material cash requirements at January 29, 2022 were $1,359.3 million for the upcoming fiscal year and $2,408.5 million in total. The material cash requirements disclosed above include merchandise purchase orders
of $769.0 million. The cancellable and noncancellable contractual commitments include purchase commitments related to distribution and transportation, information technology, advertising, energy procurement, and store security, supply, and maintenance commitments. At January 29, 2022, our noncancellable commitments were immaterial.
In August 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common shares (“2020 Repurchase Authorization”). The 2020 Repurchase Authorization was exhausted in the third quarter of 2021. During 2021, we purchased 5.6 million of our common shares for $327.2 million under the 2020 Repurchase Authorization, at an average price of $58.48.
In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the 2021 Repurchase Authorization, which provides for the repurchase of $250 million of our common shares. Pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Authorization, we are authorized to repurchase shares in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The 2021 Repurchase Authorization has no scheduled termination date. During 2021, we purchased 2.1 million of our common shares for $90.6 million under the 2021 Repurchase Authorization, at an average price of $43.90.
Common shares acquired through share repurchase authorizations are available to meet obligations under our equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes.
In 2021, we declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per common share for a total paid amount of $41.7 million. While the per-share cash dividends declared and paid in 2021 were consistent with the per-share cash dividends declared and paid in 2020, dividends declared decreased $6.5 million and dividends paid decreased $5.3 million to $41.5 million and $41.7 million, respectively, in 2021. The decrease in both was driven by a lower number of common shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases.
On March 1, 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share payable on April 1, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 18, 2022.
The following table compares the primary components of our cash flows from 2021 to 2020:
Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $205.6 million to $193.8 million in 2021 compared to $399.3 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the combined increase in cash outflows from inventories and decrease in accounts payable, which were driven by increased inventory levels at the end of 2021 compared to 2020, an increase in cash outflows from current income taxes, driven by the payment of taxes on the sale of our distribution centers since the end of 2020, and an increase in cash outflows from current liabilities, which was driven by bonus accruals and payment of FICA taxes that were deferred under the CARES Act of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net income after accounting for non-cash activities such as non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense, and the add-back for (loss) gain on disposition of equipment and property.
Cash (used in) provided by investing activities decreased $612.7 million to cash used in investing activities of $159.7 million in 2021 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $453.0 million in 2020. The decrease was driven by the decrease in cash proceeds from sale of property and equipment, due to the sale and leaseback transactions completed in the second quarter of 2020, as well as an increase in capital expenditures.
Cash used in financing activities increased by $194.4 million to $539.9 million in 2021 compared to $345.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2020. The increase was driven by the repurchase of a total of $417.7 million of our common shares under share repurchase authorizations during 2021 compared to the repurchase of $172.8 million of our common shares under share repurchase authorizations during 2020. Additionally, the increase was driven by the absence of financing proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions completed in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net repayments of long-term debt due to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement in 2020 compared to repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Term Note in 2021, which carried a lower balance at the time of repayment compared to the 2018 Credit Agreement at the time of repayment.
Based on historical and expected financial results, we believe that we have or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund our cash requirements, including ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements, proposed capital expenditures, new projects, and currently maturing obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates, judgments, and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Our significant accounting policies, including the recently adopted accounting standards and recent accounting standards - future adoptions, if any, are described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following estimates, assumptions, and judgments are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow-moving inventory and the allowance for shrinkage, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and current or future gross margin. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information.
When management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, the age of merchandise, and seasonal trends. Timing of holidays within fiscal periods, weather, and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.
The allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories, charged to cost of sales, and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on both our current year and historical inventory results. Independent physical inventory counts are typically taken at each store once a year. During calendar 2021, the majority of physical counts occurred between January and June and we expect a similar cadence to physical counts during calendar 2022. As physical inventories are completed, actual results are recorded and new go-forward allowance for shrinkage rates are established based on historical results at the individual store level. Thus, the allowance for shrinkage rates is adjusted throughout the January to June inventory cycle based on actual results. The allowance for shrinkage at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 was $53.7 million and $40.7 million, respectively. The increase of $13.0 million was driven by a higher estimated shrinkage rate for 2021 compared to 2020, partially offset by lower aggregate sales since the last physical inventory count for each store. At January 29, 2022, a 10% difference in our shrink accrual would have affected gross margin, operating profit and income before income taxes by approximately $5.4 million. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have asset protection programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage.
Insurance and Insurance-Related Reserves
We are self-insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers’ compensation, and employee medical, dental, and prescription drug benefit claims, a portion of which is funded by employees. We purchase stop-loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposures in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially-based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity. Management makes estimates, judgments, and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially-based calculations, including but not limited
to, estimated health care cost trends, estimated lag time to report and pay claims, average cost per claim, network utilization rates, network discount rates, and other factors. Our insurance and insurance-related reserves at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 were $99.3 million and $92.1 million, respectively. The increase of $7.2 million was driven by workers' compensation reserves due to rising medical costs and our reserve for self-insured matters that have exceeded stop-loss thresholds, for which we carry an equal receivable from our stop-loss insurers. A 10% change in our self-insured liabilities at January 29, 2022 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income before income taxes by approximately $8.2 million.
