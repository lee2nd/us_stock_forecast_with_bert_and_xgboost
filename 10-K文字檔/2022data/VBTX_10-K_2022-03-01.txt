ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a Texas state banking organization with corporate offices in Dallas, Texas. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Veritex Community Bank, a Texas state-chartered bank, we provide relationship-driven commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses and professionals. Beginning at our operational inception in 2010, we initially targeted customers and focused our acquisitions primarily in the Dallas metropolitan area, which we consider to be Dallas and the adjacent communities in North Dallas. Our current primary market now includes the broader Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. As we continue to grow, we may expand to other metropolitan banking markets in Texas.
Our business is conducted through one reportable segment, community banking, which generates the majority of our revenues from interest income on loans, customer service and loan fees, gains on sale of government guaranteed loans and mortgage loans and interest income from securities. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries, employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest earning assets and expense of our liabilities through net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets.
Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Texas and, specifically, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Houston metropolitan area, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our target market and throughout the state of Texas.
Recent Developments
COVID-19 Effects, Actions and Recent Developments
Overview. During 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the President of the United States. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have included quarantines/shelter-in-place orders, the closure or limiting capacity of businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain limitations and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. As the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, its severity; the duration of the outbreak; the impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). COVID-19 has negatively affected, and is expected to continue to negatively affect, our business, financial position and operating results. In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time, but it has been and is expected to
continue to be material. The longer-term potential impact on our business could depend to a large extent on future developments and actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 and its economic impact. Furthermore, the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period as the potential exists for additional variants of COVID-19, including the recent Omicron variant, to impede the global economic recovery and exacerbate geographic differences in the spread of, and response to, COVID-19.
Impact on our Operations. In 2020, the State of Texas and many other jurisdictions declared health emergencies. The resulting closures and/or limited operations of non-essential businesses and related economic disruption impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Financial services were identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security. Accordingly, our business remained open and we implemented our Business Continuity and Health Emergency Response plans to address the issues arising as a result of COVID-19 and to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees. Nonetheless, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be on-going, there continues to be uncertainties related to its magnitude, duration and persistent effects. This is particularly the case with the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus as well as the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic could still, among other things, greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism, particularly among key personnel; result in limited access to or closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices; exacerbate operational, technical or security-related risks arising from a remote workforce; and result in adverse government or regulatory agency orders. Additionally, we are experiencing an increasingly competitive labor market due to an on-going labor shortage which has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to staff open positions and/or retain existing employees and has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs. The business and operations of our third-party service providers, many of whom perform critical services for our business, could also be significantly impacted by many of these same issues, which in turn could impact us. As a result, we continue to be unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown and/or beyond our control.
Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations. Our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations, the availability of our workforce, the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us. While its effects continue to be on-going, during 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. This decrease in commercial activity caused and, in light of new and different strains of the virus, may yet further cause our customers (including affected businesses and individuals), vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. The national public health crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (and public expectations about it), combined with other factors, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruption and further oil price volatility, could, despite improvements in 2021, again destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements could further impact the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers. Borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions, which, in turn, are likely to impact our borrowers’ creditworthiness and our ability to make loans. See further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned “Loans” and “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion.
In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits, affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. Consumers affected by COVID-19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over. For example, consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis and certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings) as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction. We lend to customers operating in such industries including energy, hotels/lodging, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate, among others, that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely. Additionally, the temporary closures of bank branches in 2020 and the safety precautions implemented at re-opened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing face-to-face interaction. Our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors.
Legislative and Regulatory Actions. Actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 have impacted our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below.
During 2020, in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, the Federal Reserve:
•Expanded reverse repo operations, adding liquidity to the banking system.
•Restarted quantitative easing.
•Lowered the interest rate at the discount window by 1.5% to 0.25%.
•Reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent.
•Encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend.
•Introduced and expanded several new temporary programs to help preserve market liquidity.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted. The CARES Act contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a loan program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Under the PPP, small businesses, sole proprietorship’s, independent contractors and self-employed individuals were eligible to apply for forgivable loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. Subsequent legislation, including as noted below, allocated additional funding to the PPP. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted on December 27, 2020, provided additional funding for the PPP and allowed eligible borrowers, including certain borrowers who already received a PPP loan, to apply for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. The SBA began accepting PPP applications under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 on January 13, 2021. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted on March 11, 2021, expanded the eligibility criteria for PPP loans and revised the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP Extension Act of 2021, enacted on March 30, 2021, extended the PPP through May 31, 2021.
The above mentioned significant fiscal stimulus and monetary policy actions of the U.S. government and Federal Reserve have been contributing factors to an inflationary surge during most of 2021. As a result, in December 2021, the Federal Reserve released projections related to the target range for the federal funds rate that imply, while there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur, three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in 2022, followed by three in 2023 and two in 2024 as further discussed in the section captioned “Net Interest Income” elsewhere in this discussion.
Banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards. Such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements.
Veritex Response. We have taken deliberate actions to ensure that we have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including increasing our liquidity and reserves supported by a strong capital position. In order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable governmental directives, we implemented our operational response and preparedness plan, which includes, among other things, dispersion of critical operation processes, increased monitoring focused on higher risk operations, enhanced remote access security and further restricted internet access, enhanced security around wire transfer execution and flexible scheduling provided to employees who are unable to work from home.
Beginning in early April 2020, we began processing loan applications under the PPP, and in January 2021 we began processing applications under the latest round of the PPP. The Company believes that the majority of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. If a loan is fully forgiven, the SBA will repay the lending bank in full. If a loan is partially forgiven or not forgiven at all, a bank must look to the borrower for repayment of unforgiven principal and interest. If the borrower defaults, the loan is guaranteed by the SBA. In order to obtain loan forgiveness, a PPP borrower must submit a forgiveness application. The SBA began approving forgiveness applications on October 2, 2020.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also implemented a loan deferment program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of our borrowers who meet the program's qualifications. This program allows for a deferral of principal and/or interest payments for 90 days (“Round 1 Deferments”), which we may extend for an additional 90 days (“Round 2 Deferments”), for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative basis. The deferred payments along with interest accrued
during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. The CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, specified that COVID-19 related loan modifications executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declared by the President and (ii) January 1, 2022, on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. Additionally, under guidance from the federal banking agencies, other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers that were current prior to any relief are not troubled debt restructuring (“TDRs”) under ASC Subtopic 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors.” These modifications include short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no loans remaining on deferment under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.
Uncertainties in certain future economic conditions exist, and we have taken deliberate actions in response to these uncertainties, including increased levels of on balance sheet liquidity and increased capital ratio levels. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 closely, as well as any effects that may result from the CARES Act and the subsequent legislation enacted in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial results is highly uncertain.
Capital and liquidity
As of December 31, 2021, all of our and the Bank’s capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses. We rely on cash on hand as well as dividends from the Bank to service our debt. If our capital deteriorates such that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us for an extended period of time, we may not be able to service our debt.
We maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Wholesale funding markets have remained open to us with stable and low rates for short term funding. If an economic recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
Asset valuation
Currently, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to affect our ability to account timely for the assets on our balance sheet; however, this could change in future periods. While certain valuation assumptions and judgments will change to account for pandemic-related circumstances such as widening credit spreads, we do not anticipate significant changes in methodology used to determine the fair value of assets measured in accordance with GAAP.
Anticipated 2022 Trends
This discussion of trends expected to impact our business in 2022 is based on information presently available and reflects certain assumptions, including the current economic and interest rate environment. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have an adverse impact on our results. See “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward-looking statements. We anticipate the following trends or events related to our business in fiscal year 2022:
•Continued emphasis on credit quality and relationship banking;
•Focus on net interest margin and the impact of anticipated interest rate hikes in 2022;
•Targeted focus on talent investments to further organically grow the Company;
•Seamless integration of NAC with further expansion into the USDA space;
•Focus on deposit liquidity to fund continued organic growth;
•Leveraging of our strong capital through accretive organic growth and possible strategic acquisition opportunities; and
•Potential branch restructures, consolidations or closures to continue with our branch-light business model.
Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
General
Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $139.6 million, an increase of $65.7 million, or 88.9%, from net income available to common stockholders of $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.83, an increase of $1.35 from $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.77, an increase of $1.29 from $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Interest Income
Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, calculated as the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Fluctuations in market interest rates impact the yield and rates paid on interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities also impact net interest income. The variance driven by the changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is referred to as a “volume change.” Changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds are referred to as “rate changes.”
To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net interest income totaled $280.8 million compared to net interest income of $265.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $15.0 million, or 5.6%. The primary drivers of the increase in net interest income is the result of a $20.4 million, or 36.3% decrease in interest expense, offset by the decrease of $5.4 million, or 1.7%, in interest income resulting from a $6.1 million decrease in interest income on loans, including MW and PPP. Interest income was $316.5 million, compared to $321.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decline in interest earned on average loans was the result of a decrease in yields earned on loan balances. Average loan balances, excluding PPP loans, grew from $6.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $664.6 million, or 10.9%.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $35.7 million, compared to $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $20.4 million, or 36.3%. The year-over-year decrease was due to decreases in the averages rates paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits and certificates and other time deposits and a change in deposit mix.
Net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.24% and 3.03%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 3.39% and 3.08%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net interest margin by 15 basis points and decrease in net interest spread by 5 basis points were due to a decrease in the average yield earned on interest-bearing assets by 45 basis points, offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities by 40 basis points. The average interest earned on interest-bearing assets decreased to 3.65% during the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in yields earned on loan balances. The average interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.62% during the year ended December 31, 2021 from 1.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the decrease of average rate paid on deposits.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding and the interest earned or paid on such amounts. The table also sets forth the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is not recognized in income; however, the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans, excluding purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans, was $2.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Any nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.
(1) Includes average outstanding balances of loans held for sale of $12,093 and $15,315 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2) Net interest rate spread is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.
(3) Net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
The following table presents the changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated for each major component of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the changes attributable to changes in volume and changes attributable to changes in interest rates. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated to rate.
Provision for Credit Losses
Our provision for credit losses is a charge to income in order to bring our ACL to a level deemed appropriate by management. For a description of the factors taken into account by management in determining the ACL see “-Financial Condition-ACL on LHI”. The benefit for credit losses was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision for credit losses of $56.6 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $59.9 million, or 105.9%. The decreased provision for credit losses was primarily attributable to changes in the Texas economic forecasts used in the CECL model during the year ended December 31, 2021. These changes in the Texas economic forecasts were made to reflect the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as of December 31, 2021 compared to such forecasts utilized in the CECL model for the year ended December 31, 2020. ACL as a percentage of LHI, excluding MW and PPP loans, was 1.15% and 1.80% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Noninterest Income
Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are service charges and fees on deposit accounts, loan fees, (loss) gain on the sale of securities, gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale, government guaranteed loan income, net equity method investment income and other income. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees, which are generally recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income:
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $11.1 million or 23.4%, to $58.4 million compared to noninterest income of $47.3 million for the same period in 2020. The primary components of the increase were as follows:
Service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We earn service charges and fees from our customers for deposit-related activities. The income from these deposit activities constitutes a significant and predictable component of our noninterest income. Service charges and fees on deposit accounts were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.0 million, or 22.2%, over the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in analysis charges of $1.8 million and an increase of $1.2 million in other fee income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.
Loan fees. We earn certain loan fees in connection with funding and servicing loans. Loan fees were $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2020. The increase of $3.1 million was primarily attributable to an increase in syndication and arrangement fees of $2.4 million.
(Loss) gain on sales of securities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a loss on sales of securities of $188 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a $2.6 million gain on sales of securities during the same period in 2020. The decrease in net gain from sales of securities was primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates on debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Government guaranteed loan income, net. Government guaranteed loan income, net includes non-interest income earned on PPP loans as well as income related to the sales of government guaranteed loans. The increase in government guaranteed loan income, net of $1.6 million was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in gain on sale of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Equity method investment income. Equity method investment income is comprised of income earned on equity method investments, specifically our investment in Thrive, of which the Bank holds a 49% interest. The income from this investment was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, Thrive’s PPP loan, originated and serviced by another bank, was 100% forgiven by the SBA. As a result of our 49% investment in Thrive, $1.9 million of the $5.8 million represents our portion of the PPP loan forgiveness. There was no income from equity method investments for the same period in 2020.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, acquiring and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The major component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy expenses, depreciation and amortization of office equipment, professional fees and regulatory fees, data processing and software expenses, marketing expenses and amortization of intangibles.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense:
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $8.3 million, or 5.2%, to $167.7 million compared to noninterest expense of $159.4 million for the same period in 2020. The most significant components of the increase were as follows:
Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits include payroll expenses, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. These expenses are impacted by the amount of direct loan origination costs, which are required to be deferred in accordance with ASC 310-20 (formerly FAS91). Salaries and employee benefits were $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $15.3 million, or 19.3%, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation costs of $6.1 million, stock based compensation, incentive and bonus of $10.9 million, employee benefit expenses of $1.2 million and payroll taxes of $687 thousand, offset by an increase of $3.6 million in deferred direct loan origination costs, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Professional and regulatory fees. This category includes legal, professional, audit, regulatory, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") assessment fees. The increase of $1.2 million, or 10.4%, was primarily attributable to an increase in FDIC assessment fees of $953 thousand and an increase in legal and professional fees of $667 thousand, offset by a decrease of $432 thousand in audit and regulatory services.
Marketing. This category of expenses includes expenses related to advertising and promotions, which increased $1.7 million, or 46.4%, primarily due to a $842 thousand increase in annual sponsorship fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.
COVID expenses. This category of expenses includes expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 such as PPP incentive compensation of $500 thousand, Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") donations of $471 thousand, employee salaries of $273 thousand for employees impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased cleaning expenses of $30 thousand. There were no COVID expenses incurred in 2021.
Debt extinguishment costs. This category includes pre-payment fees as a result of structured FHLB advances paid off early in the amount of $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 with no corresponding prepayments of FHLB advances made during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense is a function of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect current statutory income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not believe a valuation allowance was necessary.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax expense totaled $36.7 million, an increase of $22.5 million, or 158.6%, compared to $14.2 million for the same period in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had an effective tax rate of 20.8%. The Company had a net discrete tax benefit of $814 thousand. This discrete tax benefit related to $838 thousand of an excess tax benefit realized on share-based payment awards, partially offset by $24 thousand of deferred tax true-ups during the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding these discrete tax items, the Company had an effective tax rate of 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an effective tax rate of 16.1%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by (i) a net tax benefit of $1.8 million as a result of the Company amending a prior year tax return of Green Bancorp, Inc. ("Green") to carry back a net operating loss ("NOL") incurred by Green on January 1, 2019, (ii) a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily associated with the recognition of excess tax benefit realized on share-based payment awards during the year ended December 31, 2020 and (iii) a $1.2 million tax benefit as a result of a deferred tax liability true-up during the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding these discrete tax items, the Company had an effective tax rate of 21.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Discussion of the results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2021.
Financial Condition
Our total assets were $9.8 billion and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Assets increased $936.4 million, or 10.6%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Our asset growth was due to the continued execution of our strategy to establish deep relationships in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area as well as our PPP loan portfolio, with which we serve small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these relationships will continue to bring in new customer accounts and grow balances from existing loan and deposit customers.
Loan Portfolio
Our primary source of income is interest on loans to individuals, professionals, small to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Houston metropolitan area. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans and real estate loans secured by CRE properties located in our primary market areas. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our interest-earning asset base.
As of December 31, 2021, total LHI were $7.4 billion, an increase of $608.5 million, or 9.0%, compared to $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. This increase was the result of the continued execution and success of our loan growth strategy as well as our PPP loan portfolio, with which we serve our small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to these amounts, loans classified as held for sale were $26.0 million and $21.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total LHI, excluding MW and PPP loans, as a percentage of deposits were 92.0% and 89.8% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Total LHI, excluding MW and PPP loans, as a percentage of total assets were 69.4% and 66.3% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
The following table summarizes our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated:
Commercial. Our commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and effectively. These loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, and secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and generally include personal guarantees.
Commercial loans increased $447.3 million, or 28.7%, to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to normal fluctuations in the commercial loan portfolio and to elevated early payoffs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
MW. Our MW loans consist of ownership interests purchased in single-family residential mortgages funded through our warehouse lending group. These loans are typically on our balance sheet for 10 to 25 days or less. We have agreements with mortgage lenders and purchase legal ownership interests in individual loans they originate. All loans are underwritten consistent with established programs for permanent financing with financially sound investors. Substantially all loans are conforming loans or loans eligible for sale to federal agencies or government sponsored entities. However, for accounting purposes, these loans are deemed to be loans to the originator and, as such, are classified as LHI.
As of December 31, 2021 we had $565.6 million of MW loans, accounting for approximately 7.7% of our total funded loans. The growth is due to bringing on more mortgage originators and a decrease in mortgage rates, which has resulted in more originations and refinancing of MW loans.
CRE. Our CRE loans include owner occupied and non-owner occupied properties, and are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows and, secondarily, as loans secured by real estate. These loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the portfolio are located throughout Texas and are generally diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry.
OOCRE loans decreased $51.9 million, or 7.2%, to $665.5 million as of December 31, 2021 from $717.5 million as of December 31, 2020. NOOCRE loans increased $216.2 million, or 11.4%, to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.
Construction and land. Our construction and land development loans consist of loans to fund construction, land acquisition and land development construction. The properties securing the portfolio are primarily located throughout Texas and are generally diverse in terms of type.
Construction and land loans increased $369.1 million, or 53.3%, to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $693.0 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase was due to the robust business and growth environment in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic disruption.
1-4 family residential. Our 1-4 family residential loans consist of loans secured by single family homes, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned. Our 1-4 family residential loans have a relatively small balance spread between many individual borrowers.
1-4 family residential loans increased $18.2 million, or 3.5%, to $542.6 million as of December 31, 2021 from $524.3 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase is a result of normal fluctuations in the 1-4 family residential loan portfolio.
PPP loans. PPP loans decreased $304.7 million, or 85.1%, as of December 31, 2021. These PPP loans were originated through the SBA as a result of the CARES Act, are 100% forgivable if certain criteria are met by the borrowers, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. As of December 31, 2021, we have no reason to believe that any of the Company’s PPP loans would not qualify for loan forgiveness or the SBA guarantee.
Other loan categories. Other categories of loans in our loan portfolio include farmland and agricultural loans made to farmers and ranchers relating to their operations, multi-family residential loans, consumer loans and purchased receivables financing. None of these categories of loans represents a significant portion of our total loan portfolio.
The contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with fixed and floating interest rates in each maturity range as of date indicated are summarized in the following tables:
Nonperforming Assets
The following table presents information regarding nonperforming loans at the dates indicated:
(1) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans included PCD loans of $11,056 and $1,508, respectively, not accounted for on a pooled basis. At December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans included performing and non-pooled purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans of $16,902 for which discount accretion have been suspended because the extent and timing of cash flows from these PCI loans could no longer be reasonably estimated. There were no PCI loans classified as nonaccrual at December 31, 2019 or 2017.
(2) At December 31, 2021, accruing loans 90 or more days past due excludes $206 in PPP loans.
Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
We have several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by our bankers, and we also monitor our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. Nevertheless, our loan portfolio could become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.
We believe our conservative lending approach and focused management of nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 or more days past due excluding pooled PCD loans and other real estate owned, has resulted in sound asset quality and timely resolution of problem assets. We had $49.9 million in nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2021 compared to $87.6 million in nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020. We had $49.9 million in nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2021 compared to $85.3 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease of $37.7 million in nonperforming assets compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the a $31.4 million decrease in nonaccrual loans and a $2.3 million decrease in other real estate owned.
The following table presents nonaccrual loans by category at the dates indicated:
Potential Problem Loans
From a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans in one of four categories: pass, special mention, substandard or doubtful. Loans classified as loss are charged-off. Loans not rated special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss are classified as pass loans. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. We review the ratings on credits monthly. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be inherent in each credit as of each monthly reporting period. All classified credits are evaluated for impairments. If impairment is determined to exist, a specific reserve is established. Our methodology is structured so that specific allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss).
Credits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness, however, such concerns are not so pronounced that we generally expect to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits with a lower rating.
Credits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses which exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to strengthen our position, and/or to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed.
Credits rated doubtful are those in which full collection of principal appears highly questionable, and in which some degree of loss is anticipated, even though the ultimate amount of loss may not yet be certain and/or other factors exist which could affect collection of debt. Based upon available information, positive action by the Company is required to avert or minimize loss. Credits rated doubtful are generally also placed on nonaccrual.
Credits classified as PCD, previously called PCI loans prior to the adoption of ASC 326, are those that, at acquisition date prior to adoption of ASU 2016-13, had credit deterioration and it was probable that all contractually required principal and interest payments would not be collected.
The following table summarizes our internal loan ratings, including PCD loans, as of the dates indicated.
ACL on LHI
We maintain an ACL that represents management’s best estimate of the credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. In determining the ACL, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the ACL is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. For additional discussion of our methodology, please refer to “-Critical Accounting Policies-Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses.”
In connection with our review of the loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include:
•for commercial and industrial loans, the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower’s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, nature and marketability of collateral;
•for commercial mortgage loans and multifamily residential loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements), operating results of the owner in the case of owner occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type;
•for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan to value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral; and
•for construction, land development and other land loans, the perceived feasibility of the project, including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratio.
As of December 31, 2021, the ACL totaled $77.8 million, or 1.15%, of total loans, excluding MW and PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, the ACL totaled $105.1 million, or 1.80%, of total loans, excluding MW and PPP loans. The decrease in the percentage of ACL to total loans compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to net charge-offs of $24.0 million that were fully reserved against in previous periods and changes in projected Texas economic forecasts using our CECL model which resulted in a $3.3 million benefit for credit losses as of December 31, 2021.
The following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the ACL and other related data:
(1)Excluding loans held for sale.
(2)Loans amortized cost basis includes $9,489 of deferred loan fees, net.
Although we believe that we have established our allowance for credit losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and that the allowance for credit losses was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. If we experience economic declines or if asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required.
The following table shows the allocation of the ACL among our loan categories and certain other information as of the dates indicated. The allocation of the ACL as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge-offs, nor as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.
Equity Securities
As of December 31, 2021, we held equity securities with a readily determinable fair value of $11.0 million compared to $11.4 million as of December 31, 2020. These equity securities represent investments in a publicly traded CRA fund and are subject to market pricing volatility, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings.
The Company held equity securities without a readily determinable fair values and measured at cost of $4.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company measures equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
FHLB Stock and FRB Stock
As of December 31, 2021, we held FHLB stock and FRB stock of $71.9 million compared to $71.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The Bank is a member of its regional Federal Reserve Bank and of the Federal Home Loan Bank (the "FHLB") system. FHLB members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. Both FRB and FHLB stock are carried at cost, restricted for sale, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Other non-marketable equity securities are carried at their cost, which approximates fair value.
Debt Securities
We use our debt securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, provide an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate risk, meet collateral requirements and meet regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of debt securities totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 0.3%, compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in our debt securities in 2021 were primarily due to purchases of debt securities of $201.4 million and net unrealized gains $23.4 million, offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of $193.2 million, and sales of $13.3 million. Debt securities represented 10.8% and 12.0% of total assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities classified as available-for-sale ("AFS") and held-to-maturity ("HTM"). As a result, the carrying values of our AFS debt securities are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Our HTM debt securities are recorded at their amortized cost. The following table summarizes the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our AFS debt securities, excluding HTM debt securities, as of the dates shown:
All of our mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored entities. We do not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, corporate equity, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, structured investment vehicles, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, subprime, Alt-A or second lien elements in our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio did not contain any securities that are directly backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.
Management evaluates AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. As of December 31, 2021, management believes that AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore no allowance for credit losses have been recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company also recorded no allowance for credit losses for its HTM debt securities as of December 31, 2021.
The following table sets forth the fair value and amortized cost for AFS securities and HTM debt securities, respectively, maturities and approximated weighted average yield based on estimated annual income divided by the average fair value of AFS debt securities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities as of the dates indicated. The contractual maturity of a mortgage-backed security is the date at which the last underlying mortgage matures.
The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay amounts outstanding. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities tend to cause the average life of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal, and consequently, the average life of this security will be lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of these securities. The weighted average life of our investment portfolio was 5.68 years with an estimated effective duration of 4.01 years as of December 31, 2021. The average yield of the securities portfolio was 2.94% during 2021 compared to 2.84% during 2020.
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we did not own securities of any one issuer other than U.S. government agency securities, for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10.0% of the consolidated stockholders’ equity as of such respective dates.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Intangible assets and goodwill as of December 31, 2021 were $66.0 million and $403.8 million, respectively, an increase of intangible assets of $4.3 million compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in intangible assets and goodwill was due to the acquisition of NAC.
Deposits
We offer a variety of deposit products having a wide range of interest rates and terms, including demand, savings, money market and time accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits.
Total deposits as of December 31, 2021 were $7.4 billion, an increase of $850.8 million, or 13.1%, compared to $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2020, due primarily to increases of $170.3 million and $413.6 million in money market accounts and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts, and an increase of $119.3 million in certificates of deposit, respectively. Our deposit growth was primarily related to our continued penetration in our primary market areas, the increase in commercial lending relationships for which we also seek deposit balances and increases in our financial institution money market accounts.
Average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $7.0 billion, an increase of $891.7 million, or 14.6% over average deposits of $6.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits decreased from 0.86% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 0.34% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was due to the overall market condition, and a decrease in the prime rate during 2021.
The following table presents the daily average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated:
Our ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total deposits was 32.3% and 29.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Factors affecting the cost of funding of our interest-bearing assets include the volume of noninterest- and interest-bearing deposits, changes in market interest rates (including increases in fed fund rates) and economic conditions in our target markets and their impact on interest paid on our deposits, change in deposit mix, as well as the ongoing execution of our balance sheet management strategy. Our cost of funds was 0.23% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2020. Average rates on interest-bearing deposits were 0.34% in 2021 and 0.86% in 2020.
Borrowings
We utilize short-term and long-term borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investment activities, each of which is discussed below.
FHLB Advance
The FHLB allows us to borrow on a blanket floating lien status collateralized by certain securities and loans. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, total borrowing capacity of $777.5 million, $766.4 million and $752.7 million, respectively, was available under this arrangement and $777.6 million, $777.7 million and $677.9 million, respectively, was outstanding, with an average interest rate of 0.94% as of December 31, 2021, 1.04% as of December 31, 2020 and 1.99% as of December 31, 2019. We utilize these borrowings to meet liquidity needs and to fund certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio. The following table presents our current FHLB advances based on year of maturity as of December 31, 2021.
The following table presents our FHLB borrowings at the dates indicated. Other than FHLB borrowings, we had no other short-term borrowings at the dates indicated.
FRB. The FRB has an available borrower in custody arrangement, which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis. Certain commercial and consumer loans are pledged under this arrangement. We maintain this borrowing arrangement to meet liquidity needs pursuant to our contingency funding plan. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $995.1 million and $871.5 million, respectively, were available under this arrangement based on collateral values of pledged commercial and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $805.7 million in commercial loans were pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under this arrangement.
Junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes.
The table below details our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. Refer to Note 14 "Borrowed Funds" for further discussion on the details of our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Liquidity management involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, wholesale borrowings, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Use of brokered deposits, purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight advances from the FHLB and the FRB are available and have been utilized to take advantage of the cost of these funding sources. We maintained five lines of credit with commercial banks that provide for extensions of credit with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate amount of $175.0 million as of December 31, 2021, five lines of credit with commercial banks with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate amount of $175.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and three lines of credit with commercial banks with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate of $150.0 million as of December 31, 2019. There were no advances under these lines of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
In addition, $53.4 million was available in conjunction with the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) which is a lending facility offered by the Federal Reserve to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, while taking the PPP loans as collateral. As of December 31, 2021, we have not utilized the PPPLF.
The following table illustrates, during the periods presented, the mix of our funding sources and the average assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of our average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled $9.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $8.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our primary source of funds is deposits, and our primary use of funds is loans. We do not expect a change in the primary source or use of our funds in the foreseeable future. Our average loans, excluding MW and PPP, net of allowance for credit loss increased 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and an increase of 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We invest excess deposits in interest-bearing deposits at other banks, the FRB or liquid investments securities until these monies are needed to fund loan growth.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.8 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit, $716.4 million in MW commitments and $65.9 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit, $354.6 million in MW commitments and $44.4 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $379.8 million, compared to $230.8 million at December 31, 2020.
Analysis of Cash Flows
Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $85.8 million from $107.7 million to $193.5 million primarily due to an increase in net income of $65.7 million and a decrease in net originations of loans held for sale of $12.9 million, proceeds from the termination of derivatives designated as hedging instruments of $43.9 million, and $6.9 million decrease in accretion of loan discount. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in (benefit) provision for credit losses of $70.5 million.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $58.2 million compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in purchases of AFS debt securities of $973.7 million and a $270.9 million decrease in net loans originated. This decrease was offset by a decrease in maturities, calls and pay downs of AFS debt securities of $840.6 million, an increase in purchases of securities under agreements to resell AFS debt securities for $102.3 million, a decrease in proceeds from sales of AFS debt securities of $100.5 million, and an increase in purchases of equity method securities of $52.1 million.
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities increased by $25.7 million compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $123.0 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes, a $100.0 million decrease in advances from FHLB and a $35.0 million decrease for the redemption of subordinated debt. This decrease was partially offset by a $232.1 million increase in deposits and a decrease in share repurchases of $42.0 million.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature.
Share Repurchases
On January 28, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a stock buyback program pursuant to which we may, from time to time, purchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock(the "Stock Buyback Program"). Our Board of Directors authorized increases of $50.0 million in September 2019, $75.0 million in December 2019 and $75.0 million in September 2021, resulting in an aggregate authorization to purchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. Our Board of Directors also authorized extensions of the expiration date of the Stock Buyback Program from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, then from December 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021 and then from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, depending upon market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulations of the SEC. The Stock Buyback Program does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. The Stock Buyback Program may be terminated or amended by the Board of Directors at any time prior to its expiration.
Share repurchases during the periods ended are as follows:
Capital Resources
Total stockholders’ equity was $1.32 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $1.20 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $111.7 million, or 9.3%. The increase from December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of $139.6 million in net income, $7.8 million of other comprehensive income, and $10.6 million of stock based compensation offset by $15.5 million in stock buybacks, $36.5 million in dividends declared and paid.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we declared and paid $36.5 million, $34.1 million and $26.8 million in cash dividends, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 we purchased 475.7 thousand, 2.3 million, and 3.8 million shares of our common stock under the Stock Buyback Program, respectively.
Capital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. Our regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements at the bank holding company and bank levels. See “Item 1. Business-Regulation and Supervision-Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy” and “Item 1. Business-Regulation and Supervision-Prompt Corrective Action” for additional discussion regarding the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was classified as “well capitalized” for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations. As we employ our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us.
The following table presents the actual capital amounts and regulatory capital ratios for us and the Bank as of the dates indicated.
Contractual Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2021. These include payments related to (i) operating leases (Note 8 - Leases), (ii) time deposits with stated maturity dates (Note 11 - Deposits), (iii) long-term borrowings (Note 14 - Borrowed Funds), and (iv) commitments to extend credit, MW commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit (Note 18 - Off-Balance-Sheet Loan Commitments).
Impact of Inflation
Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.
Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.
LIBOR Transition
On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) , confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates will end on June 30, 2023. The federal banking agencies have encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable but no later than December 31, 2021. Given LIBOR’s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. The Company’s commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade and hold various products that are currently indexed to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of loans indexed to LIBOR that mature after June 30, 2023. The Company’s products that are indexed to LIBOR are significant, and if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to the Company.
The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR. In 2019 and 2020, the ARRC released final recommended fallback contract language for new issuances of LIBOR indexed bilateral business loans, syndicated loans, floating rate notes, securitizations, and adjustable rate mortgage loans and private student loans. On April 6, 2021, New York Governor Cuomo signed into law legislation that provides for the substitution of SOFR as an alternative reference rate in any LIBOR-based contract governed by New York state law that does not include clear fallback language, once LIBOR is discontinued. The ARRC also has published other recommendations relating to the spread adjustment between LIBOR and SOFR and other transition matters. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. has announced a protocol for the transition of derivative instruments away from LIBOR.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, it is expected that the transition will span several reporting periods through at least the end of 2021. One of the major identified risks is inadequate fallback language in various existing instruments’ contracts that may result in issues establishing the alternative index and adjusting the margin as applicable. The Company continues to monitor this activity and evaluate the related risks to its business.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the financial services industry. However, we also evaluate our performance by reference to certain additional financial measures discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we identify as being “non-GAAP financial measures.” In accordance with SEC rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.
The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.
Tangible Book Value Per Common Share. Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders’ equity less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; and (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by the number of common shares outstanding at the end of the relevant period. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our book value per common share.
We believe that this measure is important to many investors who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and core deposit intangibles have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.
The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders’ equity to tangible common equity and presents our tangible book value per common share compared with our book value per common share:
Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets. Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders’ equity, less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; and (c) tangible common equity to tangible assets as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by tangible assets (as described in clause (b)). The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is total stockholders’ equity to total assets.
We believe that this measure is important to many investors who are interested in the relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, in each case, exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and core deposit intangibles have the effect of increasing both total stockholders’ equity and assets while not increasing our tangible common equity or tangible assets.
The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders’ equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets and presents our tangible common equity to tangible assets:

Critical Accounting Estimates
SEC guidance requires disclosure of “critical accounting estimates.” The SEC defines “critical accounting estimates” as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant.
We follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed to meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting policy.
ACL
Management considers the policies related to the ACL as the most critical to the financial statement presentation. The total ACL includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with ASC 310, "Receivables", and ASC 450, "Contingencies". On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). The ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged to current earnings. The amount maintained in the allowance reflects management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at the report date. The ACL is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain financial assets that do not share risk characteristics with its other financial assets and general reserves. Factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the creditworthiness of the borrower, and more specifically, changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and/or in the value of pledged collateral. A reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan’s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. For purposes of establishing the general reserve, we stratify the loan portfolio into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics and apply a loss ratio to these groups of loans to estimate the credit losses in the loan portfolio. We use both historical loss ratios and qualitative loss factors assigned to major loan collateral types to establish general component loss allocations. Refer to “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses” in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit loss.
Business Combinations
We apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. We use valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Debt Securities
Securities are classified as HTM and carried at amortized cost when we have the positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as AFS and carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. We determine the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.
Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Realized gains and losses are derived from the amortized cost of the security sold. Credit related declines in the fair value of HTM and AFS debt securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses, with the remaining unrealized loss recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. In estimating allowance for credit losses, we consider, among other things, (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and our ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
Goodwill
Goodwill resulting from a business combination represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment annually on October 31 of each fiscal year or when a triggering event occurs.
We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We have an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, and we may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test, used to identify both the existence of potential impairment and the amount of impairment loss, involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Any such adjustments to goodwill are reflected in the results of operations in the periods in which they become known.
Estimating the fair values of a reporting unit involves the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments with respect to a variety of factors, including revenues, capital expenditures, cash flows and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate and market values and multiples of earnings and revenues of similar public companies. Projected sales and capital expenditures are based on our annual business plan or other forecasted results. Discount rates reflect market-based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit.
The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows of our reporting unit, the discount rate used to discount such estimated cash flows to their net present value, and the reasonableness of the resultant implied control premium relative to our market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of the reporting unit and/or its net assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge.
