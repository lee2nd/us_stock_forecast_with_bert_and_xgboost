CORPORATE PROFILE AND OVERVIEW
Landmark Bancorp, Inc. is a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is engaged in the banking business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Landmark National Bank and in the insurance business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Landmark Risk Management, Inc. The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “LARK.” The Bank is dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services to its local communities. Our strategy includes continuing a tradition of quality assets while growing our commercial, commercial real estate and agriculture loan portfolios. We are committed to developing relationships with our borrowers and providing a total banking service.
The Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits, together with borrowings and other funds, to originate one-to-four family residential real estate, construction and land, commercial real estate, commercial, agriculture, municipal and consumer loans. Although not our primary business function, we do invest in certain investment and mortgage-related securities using deposits and other borrowings as funding sources.
Our results of operations depend generally on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand and deposit flows. In addition, we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-earning assets mature or reprice at different times, or at different speeds, than our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges, loan fees, gains from the sale of newly originated loans and gains or losses on investments, and certain other non-interest related items. Our principal operating expenses, aside from interest expense, consist of, among others, compensation and employee benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, amortization of intangibles expense, federal deposit insurance costs, data processing expenses and provision for loan losses.
We are significantly impacted by prevailing economic conditions including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulations of financial institutions. The Bank’s markets have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had and continues to have a complex and significant impact on the economy. Deposit balances are influenced by numerous factors such as competing investments, the level of income and the personal rate of savings within our market areas. Factors influencing lending activities include the demand for housing and the interest rate pricing competition from other lending institutions.
Currently, our business consists of ownership of the Bank, with its main office in Manhattan, Kansas and twenty-nine additional branch offices in central, eastern, southeast and southwest Kansas, and our ownership of Landmark Risk Management, Inc. Landmark Risk Management, Inc. is a Nevada-based captive insurance company.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require our management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses and the accounting for income taxes, all of which involve significant judgment by our management.
We perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of our lending portfolio to assess overall collectability. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the incurred losses in our loan portfolio. While these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining allowance requirements, actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results. Additional explanation of the methodologies used in establishing this allowance is provided in the “Asset Quality and Distribution” section.
The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns. The Company recognizes an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), based upon its technical merits. Once that standard is met, the amount recorded will be the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings. The Company assesses its deferred tax assets to determine if the items are more likely than not to be realized and a valuation allowance is established for any amounts that are not more likely than not to be realized. Changes in estimates regarding the actual outcome of these future tax consequences, including the effects of IRS examinations and examinations by other state agencies, could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND DECEMBER 31, 2020
SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE. Net earnings for 2021 decreased $1.5 million, or 7.6%, to $18.0 million as compared to $19.5 million for 2020. The decrease in net earnings was primarily driven by a $4.7 million decrease in gains on sales of loans due to lower housing inventories coupled with higher mortgage interest rates, which reduced refinancing activity offset by decreased interest expense and provision for loan losses.
Net interest income for 2021 increased $1.8 million to $38.3 million, or 5.0% higher than the $36.5 million recorded for 2020. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to lower interest expense as our deposits repriced lower and higher interest income on loans. The increase in interest income on loans was driven by higher income on PPP loans. During 2021, our average balance of PPP loans was $67.6 million, which generated interest income of $5.5 million in 2021. During 2020, our average balance of PPP loans was $88.5 million, which generated interest income of $3.0 million.
We distributed a 5% stock dividend for the 21th consecutive year in December 2021. All per share and average share data in this section reflect the 2021 and 2020 stock dividends.
Interest Income. Interest income for 2021 increased $573,000 to $39.8 million, an increase of 1.5% as compared to 2020. Interest income on loans increased $1.8 million, or 5.7%, to $33.6 million for 2021 as compared to $31.8 million in 2020, due primarily to the increase in our average loan balances from $668.3 million during 2020 to $689.9 million during 2020. Our average loan balances benefited from the origination of PPP loans in 2021 and 2020. While the maturities of PPP loans are two or five years, a significant amount were forgiven during 2021, which increased the yield on loans and reduced average loan balances. In addition to the higher average balances were higher yields on loans, which increased from 4.76% in 2020 to 4.88% in 2021. Interest income on investment securities decreased $1.3 million, or 16.7%, to $6.2 million during 2021, as compared to $7.5 million in 2020. The decrease in interest income on investment securities was the result of lower yields on investment securities, which decreased from 2.59% in 2020 to 1.99% in 2021. Low market interest rates have negatively impacted the yield on our investment securities portfolio as our purchases yield less than maturities. Partially offsetting the lower rates were higher average balances, which increased from $317.9 million in 2020 to $343.1 million in 2021.
Interest Expense. Interest expense during 2021 decreased $1.3 million, or 45.6%, to $1.5 million as compared to 2020. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased $1.1 million, or 51.4%, to $1.0 million for 2021 as compared to $2.1 million in 2020. Our total cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased from 0.31% during 2020 to 0.13% during 2021 as a result of lower rates paid on money market and checking accounts that have rates that reprice based on market indexes and lower rates on our certificates of deposit. Our decline in deposit rates during 2021 reflected the decreased federal funds interest rate and other market interest rates. As these rates are now near zero, we do not expect significant reductions in our cost of deposits in future periods. Partially offsetting the lower interest rates was an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances, which increased from $673.2 million in 2020 to $765.5 million in 2021. Interest expense on borrowings decreased $181,000, or 27.3%, to $483,000 during 2021 as compared to $664,000 in 2020. Contributing to lower interest expense on borrowings were lower average outstanding borrowings, which decreased from $38.8 million in 2020 to $27.6 million during 2021. Partially offsetting the lower average outstanding borrowings were higher rates paid on borrowings, which increased from 1.71% in 2020 to 1.75% in 2021.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between income derived from interest-earning assets and the expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest-earnings assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities (“interest rate spread”) as well as the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we originated approximately $186.0 million of PPP loans from April 3, 2020, the first day of the program, through May 31, 2021, the last day of the program. These loans have an interest rate of 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee, which resulted in a yield of 8.16% on PPP loans in 2021 compared to 3.40% in 2020. The maturity date of these loans is two or five years unless the borrower’s loan is forgiven, in which case the loan would be repaid sooner. Approximately 91% of our PPP loans have been forgiven as of December 31, 2021. The balance of PPP loans was $17.2 million at December 31, 2021. The average balance of PPP loans during 2021 was $67.6 million, which generated interest income of $5.5 million compared to an average balance of $88.5 million in 2020 which generated interest income of $3.0 million. There were $639,000 of origination fees remaining to be accreted into income at December 31, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed our origination of new loans, which may lead to lower net interest income and net interest margin in future periods as a result of lower loan volumes. The decline in market interest rates has adversely impacted our net interest margin as a result of lower yields on loans and investment securities exceeding the benefit of a lower cost of funds. In addition, the increase in deposit balances has increased our cash balances, which has negatively impacted our net interest margin.
During 2021, net interest income increased $1.8 million, or 5.0%, to $38.3 million compared to $36.5 million in 2020. Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.39% during 2021 from 3.72% during 2021. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to lower interest expenses as our deposits repriced lower and higher interest income on loans, primarily related to the forgiveness of PPP loans. While higher interest rates should result in increased net interest income and net interest margin, these improvements could be offset by increased competition for loans and deposits. Additionally, the deposit balance increases we have seen over the past two years may reverse resulting in the need for higher cost funding.
Provision for Loan Losses. We maintain, and our Board of Directors monitors, an allowance for losses on loans. The allowance is established based upon management’s periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, review of significant individual loans and collateral, review of delinquent loans, past loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers’ ability to repay, current and expected market conditions, and other factors management deems important. Determining the appropriate level of reserves involves a high degree of management judgment and is based upon historical and projected losses in the loan portfolio and the collateral value or discounted cash flows of specifically identified impaired loans. Additionally, allowance policies are subject to periodic review and revision in response to a number of factors, including current market conditions, actual loss experience and management’s expectations.
During 2021, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $500,000 compared to $3.3 million in 2020. We recorded net loan charge-offs of $500,000 during 2021 compared to net loan charge-offs of $992,000 during 2020. The increase in our provision for loan losses during 2020 was primarily due to the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. If the COVID-19 pandemic causes economic declines in excess of our estimations, or if the pandemic lasts longer than currently projected, our provision for loan losses may increase in future periods. We may see higher loan delinquencies and defaults in future periods as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor our allowance for loan losses in light of changing economic conditions, including those related to COVID-19.
Non-interest Income. Total non-interest income was $22.3 million in 2021, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 18.6%, compared to 2020. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily the result of decreases of $4.7 million in gains on sales of loans, as originations of one-to-four family residential real estate loans declined due to lower housing inventories and higher mortgage rates, which reduced refinancing activity. Also contributing to the decrease in non-interest income was lower gains on sales of investment securities, which decreased to $1.1 million in 2021 from $2.4 million in 2020. Partially offsetting those decreases was an increase of $766,000 in fees and service charges. The increase in fees and service charges was primarily due to growth in deposit and loan servicing fees.
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $1.0 million, or 2.7%, to $37.3 million in 2021 compared to $36.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million, or 16.4%, in other expenses as a result of an increase in costs associated with the PPP forgiveness process, loan foreclosure expense and our captive insurance subsidiary. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest expense was an increase of $247,000 in professional fees due to higher legal and consulting costs and an increase of $185,000 in data processing charges due to an increased number of accounts and products offered. Offsetting the increase in non-interest expense was a decrease of $500,000 in compensation and benefits due primarily to lower commissions paid on one-to-four family residential real estate loan originations.
INCOME TAXES. We recorded income tax expense of $4.8 million in 2021 and 2020. The effective tax rate increased from 19.7% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2021, primarily due to incurring tax expense of $162,000 in 2021 to increase our accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits compared to recognizing a tax benefit of $229,000 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in 2020.
FINANCIAL CONDITION. Economic conditions in the United States improved during 2021 as COVID-19 vaccinations and stimulus programs positively impacted the economy. The State of Kansas and the geographic markets in which the Company operates also experienced a rebound in economic condition during 2021. Some of the improvement in economic conditions has been partially offset by supply chain constraints and rising inflation. The Company’s allowance for loan losses included estimates of the economic impact of COVID-19 and other qualitative factors on our loan portfolio. However, our loan portfolio is diversified across various types of loans and collateral throughout the markets in which we operate. Aside from a few problem loans that management is working to resolve, our asset quality has remained strong over the past few years. While further increases in problem assets may arise, management believes its efforts to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue to create a strong foundation for continued growth and profitability in the future.
Asset Quality and Distribution. Our primary investing activities are the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate, construction and land, commercial real estate, commercial, agriculture, municipal and consumer loans and the purchase of investment securities. Total assets increased $140.9 million, or 11.9%, to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in our total assets was primarily the result of a $104.4 million, or 123.1%, increase in cash and cash equivalents, which increased to $189.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $84.8 million at December 31, 2020. Our increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to deposit growth and a decline in loans largely due to the forgiveness of PPP loans. Investment securities available-for-sale increased $88.9 million from $291.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $380.7 million at December 31, 2021. Net loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $49.6 million, or 7.1%, to $653.2 at December 31, 2021, compared to $702.8 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in loans was driven by the forgiveness of PPP loans which declined by $82.9 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021.
The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activity. This evaluation, which includes a review of all loans with respect to which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, level of classified loans and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate allowance for loan losses. If the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors cause economic declines in excess of our estimations, or if the pandemic lasts longer than currently projected, our provision for loan losses may remain elevated or increase in future periods. We will continue to monitor our allowance for loan losses in light of changing economic conditions related to COVID-19. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses totaled $8.8 million, or 1.32% of gross loans outstanding, as compared to $8.8 million, or 1.23% of gross loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses to gross loans outstanding was impacted by the $17.2 million and $100.1 million of PPP loans which are guaranteed by the SBA and have no allowance allocated as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $18.0 million and $25.2 million, respectively, of loans were considered classified and assigned a risk rating of special mention, substandard or doubtful. The decrease in classified loans was primarily due to improvements in the agriculture industry, and two commercial real estate loan relationships totaling $5.5 million which paid off or transferred to other real estate. These ratings indicate that the loans identified as potential problem loans have more than normal risk which raised doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms. Even though these borrowers were experiencing moderate cash flow problems as well as some deterioration in collateral value, management believed the general allowance was sufficient to cover the risks and probable incurred losses related to such loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest totaled $2.0 million, or 0.30% of gross loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to $1.5 million, or 0.22% of gross loans, at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, $5.2 million of loans were on non-accrual status, or 0.79% of gross loans, compared to $10.5 million, or 1.47% of gross loans, at December 31, 2020. The decrease in non-performing loans primarily related to two commercial real estate loan relationships totaling $5.5 million, which paid off or transferred to other real estate. Non-accrual loans consist of loans 90 or more days past due and certain impaired loans. There were no loans 90 days delinquent and accruing interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our impaired loans totaled $6.7 million December 31, 2021 compared to $12.5 million at December 31, 2020. The difference in the Company’s non-accrual loan balances and impaired loan balances at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was related to TDRs that were accruing interest but still classified as impaired.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had 11 loan relationships consisting of 16 outstanding loans totaling $3.4 million that were classified as TDRs compared to nine loan relationships consisting of 21 outstanding loans totaling $3.9 million that were classified as TDRs at December 31, 2020.
During 2021, a commercial loan relationship consisting of five loans was modified after originally being classified as a TDR in 2020. The borrower liquidated some of the collateral securing the loans and refinanced the remaining balance of $397,000 into one loan, which retained a TDR classification. A commercial loan totaling $32,000 was classified as a TDR during 2021 after the maturity of the loan was extended. The restructuring changed the payment terms to match the borrower’s cash flows. The Company had previously charged-off $100,000 of the loan due to a collateral shortfall. An agriculture loan totaling $250,000 was also classified as a TDR during 2021 after a new loan was originated to an existing classified loan relationship. The additional loan provided funds to stabilize the borrower’s operations through the fall harvest. All of the loans classified as TDRs were experiencing financial difficulties prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. An agriculture loan and two construction and land loans previously classified as TDRs in 2016 and 2012, respectively, were paid off during 2021.
During 2020, the Company modified the payment terms on an agriculture loan totaling $156,000 and classified the restructuring as a TDR. The loans related to a $1.6 million loan relationship, consisting of two one-to-our family loans, one construction and land loan, two commercial real estate loans and one commercial loan, were classified as TDRs during 2020 after negotiating restructuring agreements with the borrowers. The restructuring included a charge-off of $50,000. The loans related to one commercial loan relationship, with five loans totaling $742,000, were classified as TDRs during 2020, after the payments were modified to interest only. All of the loans classified as TDRs were experiencing financial difficulties prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. An agriculture loan, a commercial real estate loan and a one-to-four family residential real estate loan previously classified as TDRs in 2017, 2015 and 2016, respectively, paid off during 2020.
The Company did not classify any loans as TDRs during 2019. A commercial real estate loan previously classified as a TDR in 2014 paid off during 2019.
As part of our credit risk management, we continue to manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and have placed additional emphasis on commercial real estate and construction and land relationships. We are working to resolve the remaining problem credits or move the non-performing credits out of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2021, we had $2.6 million of real estate owned compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in real estate owned as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to obtaining the collateral securing non-performing commercial real estate and one-to-four family residential real estate loans. As of December 31, 2021, real estate owned consisted of commercial buildings, undeveloped land and residential real estate. The Company is currently marketing all of the remaining properties in real estate owned.
Liability Distribution. Our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits, FHLB borrowings, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates and economic conditions. We experienced an increase of $132.5 million, or 13.0% in total deposits during 2021, to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in deposits was primarily due to deposit growth in all categories of deposits with the exception of certificates of deposits. The increase in deposits was related to PPP loan proceeds, government stimulus payments and customers increasing their liquidity positions. Additionally, money market and checking accounts and savings accounts increased as a result of higher interest rates. The decrease in certificates of deposit was associated with the lower public funds balances and lower rates offered on certificates of deposit.
Total borrowings increased $1.0 million, or 3.7%, to $29.0 million at December 31, 2021, from $28.0 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in borrowings was the result of a $1.0 million increase in repurchase agreement balances.
Non-interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2021, were $350.0 million, or 30.5% of deposits, compared to $264.9 million, or 26.1% of deposits, at December 31, 2020. Money market and checking accounts were 46.8% of our deposit portfolio and totaled $536.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $491.3 million, or 48.3% of deposits, at December 31, 2020. Savings accounts increased to $155.5 million, or 13.5% of deposits, at December 31, 2021, from $126.1 million, or 12.4% of deposits, at December 31, 2020. Certificates of deposit totaled $106.1 million, or 9.2% of deposits, at December 31, 2021, compared to $133.7 million, or 13.2% of deposits, at December 31, 2020. Competition for deposits may affect our ability to continue to increase deposit balances and could result in a decrease in our deposit balances in future periods.
Certificates of deposit at December 31, 2021, scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $90.8 million. Historically, maturing deposits have generally remained with the Bank, and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain with us upon maturity in some type of deposit account.
CASH FLOWS. During 2021, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $104.4 million. Our operating activities provided net cash of $31.2 million in 2021, which is primarily the result of net earnings and sales of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Our investing activities used net cash of $56.5 million during 2021, primarily as a result of the purchase of investment securities. Our financing activities provided net cash of $129.7 million during 2021, primarily as a result of an increase in deposits.
Liquidity. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale. The levels of these assets are dependent on the operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given year. These liquid assets totaled $577.3 million at December 31, 2021 and $382.1 million at December 31, 2020. During periods in which we are not able to originate a sufficient amount of loans and/or periods of high principal prepayments, we generally increase our liquid assets by investing in short-term, high-grade investments.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of our strategy. Excess funds are generally invested in short-term investments. Excess funds are typically generated as a result of increased deposit balances, while uses of excess funds are generally deposit withdrawals and loan advances. In the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, additional funds are generally available through the use of brokered deposits, FHLB advances, a line of credit with the FHLB, other borrowings or through sales of investment securities. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance against our line of credit with the FHLB. At December 31, 2021, we had collateral pledged to the FHLB that would allow us to borrow $67.5 million, subject to FHLB credit requirements and policies. At December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings through the Federal Reserve discount window, while our borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was $79.3 million. We also have various other federal funds agreements, both secured and unsecured, with correspondent banks totaling approximately $30.0 million in available credit under which we had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, we had subordinated debentures totaling $21.7 million and other borrowings of $7.4 million, which consisted of repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings against a $7.5 million line of credit from an unrelated financial institution that matures on November 1, 2022, with an interest rate that adjusts daily based on the prime rate less 0.25%. This line of credit has covenants specific to capital and other financial ratios, which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2021. The Company is eligible to pledge PPP loans to the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility for additional liquidity, but the Company has not utilized this facility to date.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. As a provider of financial services, we routinely issue financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party. While these standby letters of credit represent a potential outlay by us, a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We have recourse against the customer for any amount the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit. The letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies, underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us. Most of the standby letters of credit are secured, and in the event of nonperformance by the customers, we have the right to the underlying collateral, which could include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. The contract amount of these standby letters of credit, which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us, was $1.9 million at December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding loan commitments, excluding standby letters of credit, of $139.5 million. We anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet current loan commitments. These commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance real estate loans.
CAPITAL. Current regulatory capital regulations require financial institutions (including banks and bank holding companies) to meet certain regulatory capital requirements. The Company and the Bank are subject to the Basel III Rule that implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than “small bank holding companies” (generally, non-public bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3.0 billion).
The Basel III Rule requires a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 6.0%, a Total Capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage minimum ratio of 4.0%. A capital conservation buffer, equal to 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements (other than the Tier 1 leverage ratio). At December 31, 2021, the Bank maintained a leverage ratio of 10.58% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 18.46%. As shown by the following table, the Bank’s capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements in effect at December 31, 2021, including the capital conservation buffers.
(1) The minimum required percent includes a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.
We believe the Company has adequate capital to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any economic downturn on our asset quality and net earnings. The Company performs stress tests on the loan portfolio to measure the impact of severe economic recessions on its capital levels to help it monitor capital levels in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Banks and bank holding companies are generally expected to operate at or above the minimum capital requirements. The Company’s and the Bank’s ratios above are well in excess of regulatory minimums. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company and the Bank also exceeded the “well capitalized” thresholds, which is the highest rating available. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Company’s and the Bank’s category as of the date of this report. We have $21.7 million in trust preferred securities which, in accordance with current capital guidelines, have been included in total risk-based capital as of December 31, 2021. Cash distributions on the securities are payable quarterly, are deductible for income tax purposes and are included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
DIVIDENDS
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.19 per share to our stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to 5% stock dividends, which we distributed for the 21th consecutive year in December 2021. The 2020 quarterly cash dividends were $0.18 per share as adjusted to give effect to 5% stock dividends.
The payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations. As described above, the Bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2021. The National Bank Act imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that a national bank may pay without prior regulatory approval. Generally, the amount is limited to the bank’s current year’s net earnings plus the adjusted retained earnings for the two preceding years. As of December 31, 2021, $26.7 million was available to be paid as dividends to the Company by the Bank without prior regulatory approval.
Additionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the subordinated debentures associated with the trust preferred securities that are held by three business trusts that we control. Interest payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. We have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if we elect to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation can be found in the increased cost of our operations because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary, and interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of inflation.
