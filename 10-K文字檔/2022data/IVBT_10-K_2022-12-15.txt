Overview
Effective March 31, 2022, as approved by the shareholders, the name of the Company was changed from Gridiron BioNutrients, Inc. (trading symbol GVMP) to Innovation1 Biotech Inc. (trading symbol IVBT).
Innovation1 Biotech Inc. (“IVBT”) believes it will be among the first companies to harness the raw power of botanical therapeutics by transforming them into fully synthetic drugs that are safely, reliably and consistently delivered. There are two fundamental limitations in exploiting botanical Schedule 1 molecules:
1.
Large and unpredictable pharmacokinetic excursions, both high and low, that make the drug potentially dangerous or ineffective
2.
Insolubility in water that curtails bioavailability across mucosal membranes
To address these limitations, ST Biosciences, Ltd. engaged with Salzman Group, and Innovation1 later assumed the contractual obligations subsequent to the Asset Purchase Agreement completed on November 9, 2021 in order to gain access to a broader portfolio of intellectual property. According to Dr. Andrew Salzman, the Salzman Group, has pioneered the design and development of novel small molecules in the fields of cancer, heart disease, lung injury, intermediary metabolism and ophthalmology. The firm is currently regarded as a world leader in the design and optimization of rare cannabinoids.
IVBT has acquired five proprietary preclinical prodrugs, all fully synthetic without connection to botanical sourcing: a mushroom-derived psychedelic molecule for treatment post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, a novel cannabinoid and tree bark derived psychedelic for treatment of addiction and three additional novel cannabinoid prodrugs addressing clinical indications of refractory pediatric epilepsy, hypertrophic scarring from burn wound injury and ocular inflammation of the cornea and anterior uvea. IVBT’s drug portfolio uniquely positions IVBT to capitalize on the growing global demand for pharmaceutical Schedule 1 drugs.
Going Concern and Cash Flows
Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had no revenue and a net operating loss of $40,877,813 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. The Company has working capital deficit of $29,525,460 and an accumulated deficit of $44,551,043 as of August 31, 2022. We do not have sufficient funds to support our daily operations for the next twelve (12) months. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The ability of the Company to fully commence its operations is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations and execution of its business plan. In response to these concerns, management plans to fund operations through additional debt and equity financing. Debt instruments may be convertible or non-convertible and will vary based on the Company’s needs and financing options available at such times. There can be no assurance that management’s plan will be successful.
The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business model and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.
COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Subsequently, the COVID-19 spread globally including across North America and the United States. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. While the threat of continued or resurgent lockdowns or containment efforts have abated, we caution that our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to additional outbreaks of COVID-19.
Critical Accounting Policies
Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Results of Operations
Overview. We had revenues of $0 and $3,080 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We incurred a net income (loss) of ($40,690,155) and $1,039,932 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net income is attributable to the factors discussed below.
Revenues. We had revenues from operations of $0 and $3,080 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our revenues for the year ended August 31, 2021 consisted primarily of our retail line of health water infused with probiotics and minerals and the sale of one liter of T-free distillate. The extent to which, and the amount of revenues which may be generated from our future business operations and activities is unknown.
Gross Margin. Once cost of revenue and other expenses to generate revenue are considered, we had gross margins of $0 and $1,659 from our operations for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Expenses. Our operating expenses were $40,877,813 and $260,100 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to increased impairment expense of $35,780,148 of the Mioxal intangible assets, as well as increases of $4,237 in advertising, $324,658 in consulting fees, $125,518 in general and administrative expenses, $359,978 in professional fees, $201,165 in research and development, $1,259,519 in salaries, and $2,546,362 in depreciation and amortization expenses.
Other (Income) Expense. Our total other (income) expense was ($152,080) and ($1,298,373) for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in other expenses was attributable to a decrease of $99,910 in interest expense, a decrease of $41,929 in interest income, a decrease $1,454,480 in gain on change in fair value of a derivative liability, a decrease of $8,349 in other income, and an increase of $143,956 in gain on extinguishment of debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended August 31, 2022, we used net cash of $3,127,852 for operating activities, primarily attributable to our aforementioned operating expenses. We used $853,138 in investing activities primarily attributable to our purchase the Mioxal asset. For the year ended August 31, 2022, we were provided $4,000,000 from financing activities for proceeds from our series B-1 preferred stock purchase agreements. We will require additional working capital to continue.
Assets
We had total assets of $43,963,413 as of August 31, 2022, which consisted of $156,486 cash, other receivable of $56,421, prepaid expenses of $74,049, equipment of $2,615 (net of accumulated depreciation), trademarks of $1,680, intangibles of $42,980,076, ROU asset of $482,086 and security deposits of $210,000 ($150,000 paid to Herring Creek Pharmaceuticals and $60,000 as part of a lease agreement).
Liabilities
We had total liabilities of $41,110,839 as of August 31, 2022 consisting of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $265,415, lease liability of $497,626, note payable of $10,000, dividends payable of $837,798, and the Mioxal liability of $39,500,000.
Cash Requirements
At August 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $156,486. Such cash amount of $156,486 is not sufficient to continue our 12-month plan of operation. We will need to raise capital to realize our 12-month plan of operation and fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or from entering into notes payable. If we are successful in completing equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing.
