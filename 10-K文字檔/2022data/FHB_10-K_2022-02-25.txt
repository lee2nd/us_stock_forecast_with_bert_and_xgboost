ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, contains, and from time to time our management may make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would,” “annualized” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
A number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including the following: the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any other pandemic, epidemic or health-related crisis; the geographic concentration of our business; current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan in particular; our dependence on the real estate markets in which we operate; concentrated exposures to certain asset classes and individual obligors; the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our business including our net interest income, net interest margin, the fair value of our investment securities, and our mortgage loan originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale; changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined or the discontinuance of LIBOR; the possibility of a deterioration in credit quality in our portfolio; the possibility we might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio; our ability to maintain our Bank's reputation; the future value of the investment securities that we own; our ability to attract and retain customer deposits; our inability to receive dividends from our bank, pay dividends to our common stockholders and satisfy obligations as they become due; the effects of severe weather, geopolitical instability, including war, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other severe health emergencies and man-made and natural disasters; our ability to maintain consistent growth, earnings and profitability; our ability to attract and retain skilled employees or changes in our management personnel; our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies and the effects of competition in the financial services industry on our business; the effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures; our ability to keep pace with technological changes; any failure or interruption of our information and communications systems; our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks; the occurrence of fraudulent activity or effect of a material breach of, or disruption to, the security of any of our or our vendors’ systems; the failure to properly use and protect our customer and employee information and data; the possibility of employee misconduct or mistakes; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services; changes in the demand for our products and services; the effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions; our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; our use of the secondary mortgage market as a source of liquidity; risks associated with the sale of loans and with our use of appraisals in valuing and monitoring loans; the possibility that actual results may differ from estimates and forecasts; fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures; the effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party; the potential for environmental liability; the risk of being subject to litigation and the outcome thereof; the impact of, and changes in, applicable laws, regulations and accounting standards and policies; possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations; our likelihood of success in, and the impact of, litigation or regulatory actions; our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock; contingent liabilities and unexpected tax liabilities that may be applicable to us as a result of the Reorganization Transactions; and damage to our reputation from any of the factors described above.
Further, statements about the potential effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, clients, third parties and us.
The foregoing factors should not be considered an exhaustive list and should be read together with the other cautionary statements set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Recent Developments regarding COVID-19 and the Hawaii and Global Economy
Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to businesses and economies around the world, particularly those in the United States. Our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. Restrictive measures to address the pandemic eased throughout 2021, resulting in the improvement of the U.S. economy, relatively to the corresponding period in 2020. The increased availability of COVID-19 vaccinations began to mitigate the public health effects of the pandemic. However, there was a rise in cases during the last three months of 2021 due to the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 and slower progress on vaccination rates. Recovery from the related economic crisis continues to disproportionately affect certain industries, geographies, and demographics more than others.
We recognize that our customers continue to experience varying degrees of financial distress. There remains a high degree of uncertainty relating to the ongoing spread and severity of the virus and other potential new variants. To the extent that the economy continues to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our results will be affected. In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time, but it has been and is expected to continue to be material.
Hawaii Economy
Hawaii’s economy continues to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and the responses to it. Because the Hawaii economy is heavily dependent on tourism, the combination of various response measures to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant fluxes in Hawaii unemployment. The statewide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.7% in December 2021 compared to 9.3% in December 2020, according to the State of Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, while the national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9% in December 2021 compared to 6.7% in December 2020. Despite decreasing unemployment rates, Hawaii’s demand for workers continues to strengthen but is constrained by a labor shortage that, in many cases, is impeding business activity throughout the State.
Visitor arrivals for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 150.3% compared to the same period in 2020, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. However, the timing and extent of the recovery of the Hawaii tourism industry remains highly uncertain and beyond our control.
The volume of home sales on Oahu has increased relative to the corresponding period of 2020, which was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the volume of single-family home sales increased by 17.9%, while condominium sales increased by 53.1% compared to the same period in 2020, according to the Honolulu Board of Realtors. The median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu was $990,000 and $475,000, respectively, or an increase of 19.3% and 9.2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. As of December 31, 2021, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 0.8 and 1.6 months, respectively. Lastly, state general excise and use tax revenues increased by 18.6% for year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, according to the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism.
Legislative and Regulatory Developments
Actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to partially mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 and related containment measures have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below.
The Federal Reserve has instituted a number of other measures to mitigate the lasting impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, offset forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. For example, among other things, the Federal Reserve lowered the rate charged on its discount window while extending the length of the loans offered and introduced a number of additional facilities designed to enhance support for small and mid-sized businesses.
The U.S. government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, such as:
● The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, established, among other COVID-19 relief programs, a $670 billion loan program (the “Paycheck Protection Program” or the “PPP”) for fully guaranteed loans (which may then be forgiven) to small businesses.
● The Consolidated Appropriations Act - 2021 (the “CAA”) extended the term of a number of initiatives under the CARES Act. One such example was the extension of the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) authority to make commitments under the PPP to March 31, 2021 or until the additional PPP funds were exhausted. The PPP Extension Act of 2021 later extended the covered period of the PPP to June 30, 2021. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021.
● The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“American Rescue Plan”), enacted on March 11, 2021, builds upon the measures established in the CARES Act and the CAA. Through this legislation, unemployment benefits were extended to September 6, 2021, eligible individuals received direct stimulus payments of up to $1,400, an additional $7 billion was added to the PPP, while expanding eligibility to include non-profit organizations previously excluded from the program, and funds were allocated for COVID-19 vaccines, testing and contact tracing.
We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government.
The State of Hawaii received at least $1.25 billion in federal aid from the CARES Act, with a majority of this federal aid used to help fund state and county government response efforts to COVID-19. Additional federal funding is expected to provide unemployment assistance, direct cash payments to Hawaii residents and funding to support local schools and colleges. The CAA provided an additional $1.7 billion in new federal funding, while extending the ability of the State of Hawaii and its local governments to use its previously received federal aid until December 31, 2021. The State of Hawaii has fully allocated the $1.6 billion of federal funding received from the American Rescue Plan.
Impact to our Operations
We saw a significant decrease in customer traffic in our branches in recent periods. As a result, in 2020, we strategically closed 26 of our branch locations on a temporary basis. As of January 2022, we reopened 19 of the temporarily closed branch locations in connection with the reopening of local businesses and permanently closed 7 branches. The temporary (or in certain cases, permanent) closures of bank branches and the safety precautions implemented at reopened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and seeing less need for face-to-face interaction. Our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors. The Bank continues to adapt to these changing behaviors and launched its newly enhanced mobile banking application in April 2021, allowing customers to perform certain transactions virtually as well as integrate their financial information in one place. We continue to provide service to customers and operate our businesses on all islands of Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Many of our employees continue to work remotely. We continue to emphasize the importance of practicing social distancing and good hygiene practices in the workplace, especially as more employees have returned to working in our physical offices and spaces.
Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations
We expect that COVID-19 will continue to impact commercial activity throughout the State of Hawaii and nationally, and thus continue to affect the way our customers (businesses and individuals), vendors and counterparties meet existing payment, or other, obligations to us. As Hawaii’s economy remains open, we expect that local consumption of goods and services will continue to improve. Although Hawaii’s economy had favorable results with the recent holiday season, the timing and extent of the recovery of the Hawaii tourism industry continues to remain uncertain and is dependent upon, among other things, the number of cases declining around the globe, in the United States and, in particular, in Hawaii, public health impacts of the new COVID-19 variants, the continued administration of the vaccine to unvaccinated populations, and the effectivity and the duration of immunity granted by current vaccines.
During this time of uncertainty, we remain committed to servicing our customers. The economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits, affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. For example, certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on visitors or in-person foot traffic) as certain consumers may still be hesitant to travel or return to full social interaction. We lend to customers operating in such industries including tourism, hotels/lodging, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate, among others. We will continue to closely monitor the impact that COVID-19 has on our customers and will adjust the means by which we assist our customers during this period of financial hardship.
The uncertainty of the economy as it recovers from the pandemic may continue to have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. The national public health crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with other factors, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages and supply chain disruption, could, despite improvements in 2021, again destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements could further impact the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers. Borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions, which, in turn, are likely to impact our borrowers’ creditworthiness and our ability to make loans.
In light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions, we continue to carefully monitor our capital and liquidity positions. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was “well-capitalized” and met all applicable regulatory capital requirements, including a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.24%, compared to the minimum requirement of 4.50%. We continue to anticipate that we will have sufficient capital levels to meet all of these requirements. Additionally, we continue to access our routine short-term funding sources, such as borrowings and repurchase agreements, and to assess longer-term funding sources. For additional discussions regarding our capital and liquidity positions and related risks, refer to the sections titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Capital” in this MD&A.
These and other key factors could impact our profitability in future reporting periods. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, beginning in the section captioned “Summary of Risk Factors.”
Selected Financial Data:
Our financial highlights for the years indicated are presented in Table 1:
(continued)
(1) We present net interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense, net income, basic earnings per share, diluted earnings per share and the related ratios described below, on an adjusted, or “core,” basis, each a non-GAAP financial measure. These core measures exclude from the corresponding GAAP measure the impact of certain items that we do not believe are representative of our financial results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures helps identify underlying trends in our business from period to period that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses, gains and other items included in our operating results. We believe that these core measures provide useful information about our operating results and enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future performance. Investors should consider our performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing our performance or financial condition. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense and net income to their “core” non-GAAP financial measures:
(a) Costs associated with the sale of stock for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 related to changes in the valuation of the funding swap entered into with the buyer of our Visa Class B restricted sales in 2016.
(b) One-time items for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of fees related to the prepayment of $200.0 million of FHLB advances and severance costs. One-time items for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a nonrecurring payment to a former executive of the Company pursuant to the Bank’s Executive Change-in-Control Retention Plan, nonrecurring offering costs and the loss on our funding swap as a result of a 2019 decrease in the conversion rate of our Visa Class B restricted shares sold in 2016.
(c) Represents the adjustments to net income, tax effected at the Company’s effective tax rate for the respective period.
(2) Core net interest margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core net interest margin as the ratio of core net interest income to average earning assets. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core net interest income, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(3) Core efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core efficiency ratio as the ratio of core noninterest expense to the sum of core net interest income and core noninterest income. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core noninterest expense, core net interest income and core noninterest income, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(4) Core return on average total assets is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core return on average total assets as the ratio of core net income to average total assets. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core net income, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(5) Core return on average tangible assets is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core return on average tangible assets as the ratio of core net income to average tangible assets, which is calculated by subtracting (and thereby effectively excluding) amounts related to the effect of goodwill from our average total assets. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core net income, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(6) Core return on average total stockholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core return on average total stockholders’ equity as the ratio of core net income to average total stockholders’ equity. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core net income, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(7) Core return on average tangible stockholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core return on average tangible stockholders’ equity as the ratio of core net income to average tangible stockholders’ equity, which is calculated by subtracting (and thereby effectively excluding) amounts related to the effect of goodwill from our average total stockholders’ equity. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core net income, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(8) Core noninterest expense to average assets is a non-GAAP financial measure. We compute our core noninterest expense to average assets as the ratio of core noninterest expense to average assets. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for core noninterest expense, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Table.
(9) Return on average tangible assets, return on average tangible stockholders’ equity, tangible book value per share and tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We compute our return on average tangible assets as the ratio of net income to average tangible assets. We compute our return on average tangible stockholders’ equity as the ratio of net income to average tangible stockholders’ equity. We compute our tangible book value per share as the ratio of tangible stockholders’ equity to outstanding shares. We compute our tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets as the ratio of tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets. We believe that these financial measures are useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate financial performance and capital adequacy relative to other financial institutions. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by shareholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
The following table provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with their most closely related GAAP measures for the years indicated:
Financial Highlights
Net income was $265.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $80.0 million or 43% as compared to 2020. Basic earnings per share was $2.06 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.63 per share or 44% as compared to 2020. Diluted earnings per share was $2.05 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.62 or 43% as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a benefit to provision for credit losses (the "Provision") of $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a Provision of $121.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by a $37.8 million increase in noninterest expense, a $25.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes, a $12.5 million decrease in noninterest income and a $5.2 million decrease in net interest income.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was negatively impacted by $9.0 million in fees related to the prepayment of the $200.0 million FHLB advances, a $6.0 million charge on the funding swap for the Visa Class B restricted shares sold in 2016, a $2.1 million loss on litigation, and a $1.2 million severance cost expense. Core net income was $279.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $89.9 million or 47% as compared to 2020. Core basic earnings per share was $2.17 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.71 or 49% as compared to 2020. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.16 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.71 or 49% as compared to 2020. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Table 2, GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.

Diluted earnings per share was $1.43 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.70 or 33% as compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $107.9 million increase in the Provision and a $37.7 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $39.3 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, a $4.8 million increase in noninterest income and a $2.8 million decrease in noninterest expense.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by a $4.8 million charge on the funding swap for the Visa Class B restricted shares sold in 2016. Core net income was $189.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $102.4 million or 35% as compared to 2019.

Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders’ equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders’ equity, see Table 3, GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.
Our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 were highlighted by the following:
● Net interest income was $530.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5.2 million or 1% as compared to 2020. Our net interest margin was 2.43% for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 34 basis points as compared to 2020. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower yields in most loan categories, a decrease in average loan balances in a few loan categories and lower yields in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher average balances in our investment securities portfolio and lower deposit funding costs.
● The Provision was a benefit of $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a Provision of $121.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The benefit was largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL at levels deemed adequate to absorb probable credit losses that are expected in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date.
● Noninterest income was $184.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $12.5 million or 6% as compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $21.4 million decrease in other noninterest income, a $2.6 million decrease in bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, a $0.9 million decrease in trust and investment services income and a $0.7 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. This was partially offset by an $8.1 million increase in credit and debit card fees and a $4.7 million increase in other service charges and fees.
● Noninterest expense was $405.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $37.8 million or 10% as compared to 2020. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an $18.7 million increase in other noninterest expense, an $8.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $4.4 million increase in equipment costs, a $3.1 million increase in card rewards program expenses, a $2.8 million increase in contracted services and professional fees and a $0.5 million increase in occupancy expense.
Our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were highlighted by the following:
● Net interest income was $535.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $37.7 million or 7% as compared to 2019. Our net interest margin was 2.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 43 basis points as compared to 2019. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower yields in all loan categories and lower yields in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by lower deposit funding costs and higher average balances in our investment securities portfolio.
● The Provision was $121.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $107.9 million as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher expected credit losses as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on Hawaii’s economy, key industries, businesses and our customers. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL at levels deemed adequate to absorb probable credit losses that are expected in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date.
● Noninterest income was $197.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.8 million or 3% as compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $20.7 million increase in other noninterest income, a $2.6 million decrease in the net loss on investment securities and a $0.6 million increase in trust and investment services income. This was partially offset by a $11.3 million decrease in credit and debit card fees, a $5.6 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts and a $2.4 million decrease in other service charges and fees.
● Noninterest expense was $367.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.8 million or 1% as compared to 2019. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $7.8 million decrease in card rewards program expenses, a $3.3 million decrease in other noninterest expense and a $1.2 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in contracted services and professional fees, a $2.9 million increase in equipment costs, a $1.3 million increase in regulatory assessment and fees and a $1.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits.
Balance sheet highlights consisted of the following:
● Total loans and leases were $13.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $317.1 million or 2% as compared to December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our commercial and industrial portfolio, which was largely due to a decrease in PPP loans of $584.8 million from the prior year, as well as reductions in our dealer flooring portfolio. These decreases were offset by increases in our residential portfolio and our commercial real estate portfolio.
● The ACL was $157.3 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $51.2 million or 25% from December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned improvement in credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ratio of our ACL to total loans and leases outstanding decreased to 1.21% as of December 31, 2021, compared to 1.57% as of December 31, 2020. The overall level of the ACL was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile and the Hawaii economy.
● We continued to invest in high-grade investment securities, primarily collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The total fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.4 billion or 39% compared to December 31, 2020. The higher balances in investment securities were primarily due to redeploying excess balance sheet liquidity.
● Total deposits were $21.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.6 billion or 13% from December 31, 2020. The increase in total deposits was primarily due to a $1.9 billion increase in demand deposits, a $0.7 billion increase in money market deposit balances and a $0.6 billion increase in savings deposit balances, partially offset by a $0.6 billion decrease in time deposit balances.
● Total stockholders’ equity was $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $87.2 million or 3% from December 31, 2020. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was primarily due a $153.3 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, dividends declared and paid to the Company’s stockholders of $134.1 million and common stock repurchases of $75.0 million, partially offset by earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $265.7 million, and equity-based awards of $9.5 million.
Analysis of Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, average balances, related income and expenses, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, and resulting yields and rates are presented in Table 4. An analysis of the change in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, is presented in Table 5.
(1) Non-performing loans and leases are included in the respective average loan and lease balances. Income, if any, on such loans and leases is recognized on a cash basis.
(2) Interest income includes taxable-equivalent basis adjustments of $2.8 million, $0.7 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(1) The change in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $533.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.1 million or 1% as compared to 2020. Our net interest margin was 2.43% for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 34 basis points as compared to 2020. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to lower yields in most loan categories, a decrease in average loan balances in a few loan categories and lower yields in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher average balances in our investment securities portfolio and lower deposit funding costs. Yields on our loans and leases were 3.42% for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 25 basis points as compared to 2020. We experienced a decrease in our yield from total loans primarily due to decreases in our commercial and industrial (excluding PPP loans), commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. The decrease in our adjustable rate commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans are typically based on LIBOR. Fees are accelerated into net interest income upon the forgiveness of PPP loans. Net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $31.6 million and $16.7 million, respectively, of fees from PPP loans. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately $5.4 million of additional fees remaining on our PPP loans that had not yet been recognized into income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the average balance of our investment securities portfolio increased $2.2 billion or 45% to $7.1 billion. Yields on our investment securities portfolio were 1.46% for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 21 basis points compared to 2020. Deposit funding costs were $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $21.6 million or 61% compared to 2020. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 11 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 19 basis points compared to 2020.
The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began in 2019 at 5.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. During 2020, the prime rate decreased 150 basis points in March to end the first quarter at 3.25%, where it remained as at the end of 2021. As noted above, our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the LIBOR. At December 31, 2021, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 0.10% and 0.21%, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 0.14% and 0.24%, respectively, while at December 31, 2019, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 1.76% and 1.91%, respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began 2019 at 2.25% to 2.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 1.50% to 1.75%. During 2020, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 150 basis points in March to at 0.00% to 0.25%, where it remained as at the end of 2021. The decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in 2020 was largely an emergency measure by the Federal Reserve aimed at mitigating the economic impact of COVID-19. In December 2021, the Federal Reserve released projections related to the target range for the federal funds rate that imply, while there can be no such assurance, increases in the federal funds rate will occur in 2022, followed by additional increases in 2023 and 2024.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $536.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $37.0 million or 6% as compared to 2019. Our net interest margin was 2.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 43 basis points as compared to 2019. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to lower yields in all loan categories and lower yields in our investment securities portfolio and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. This was partially offset by lower deposit funding costs and higher average balances in our investment securities portfolio. Yields on our loans and leases were 3.67% for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 72 basis points as compared to 2019. We experienced a decrease in our yield from total loans primarily due to decreases in adjustable rate commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, which are typically based on LIBOR. Decreases in the yield on commercial and industrial loans also stemmed from our participation in the PPP, as these loans have a fixed interest rate of one percent per annum. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the average balance of our investment securities portfolio increased $596.3 million or 14% to $4.9 billion. Yields on our investment securities portfolio were 1.67% for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 48 basis points compared to 2019. Deposit funding costs were $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $52.4 million compared to 2019. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 30 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 51 basis points compared to 2019.
Provision for Credit Losses
The Provision was a benefit of $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a Provision of $121.7 million in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Provision included a negative $38.7 million in provision for credit losses for loans and leases and a negative $0.3 million in provision for credit losses for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The benefit was largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded net charge-offs of $12.5 million and $30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This represented net charge-offs of 0.10% and 0.23% of total average loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The ACL was $157.3 million and $208.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and represented 1.21% of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2021, compared to 1.57% of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2020. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $30.3 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $30.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate by management based on the factors noted in the “Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Credit Risk” section of this MD&A.
Noninterest Income
Table 6 presents the major components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:

Service charges on deposit accounts were $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $0.7 million or 2% as compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in checking account service fees and a $0.2 million decrease in overdraft and checking account fees, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in ATM interchange fees from customers. Service charges on deposit accounts were $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $5.6 million or 17% as compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a $5.3 million decrease in overdraft and checking account fees, resulting from decreased transactions and spending due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a $0.8 million decrease in ATM interchange fees from customers, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in account analysis service charges.
Credit and debit card fees were $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.1 million or 15% as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in interchange settlement fees, a $3.7 million increase in merchant service revenues, a $1.2 million increase in ATM interchange and surcharge fees, and a $1.0 million increase in debit card interchange fees. This was partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in network association dues. Credit and debit card fees were $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $11.3 million or 17% as compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to an $8.3 million decrease in interchange settlement fees and a $7.1 million decrease in merchant service revenues, both resulting from decreased transactions and spending due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease also related to a $2.3 million decrease in ATM interchange and surcharge fees, resulting from FHI waving ATM surcharge fees for a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a $0.3 million decrease in credit card fees from cash advances. This was partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease in network association dues.
Other service charges and fees were $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.7 million or 14% as compared to 2020.

Trust and investment services income was $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $0.9 million or 3% as compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in business cash management fees, a $0.4 million decrease in money market fund management fees, a $0.2 million decrease in personal property agency account fees, and a $0.2 million decrease in tax services. This was partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in investment management fees and a $0.9 million increase in irrevocable trust fees. Trust and investment services income was $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.6 million or 2% as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in investment management fees, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in administrative fees for retirement accounts.
BOLI income was $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.6 million or 16% as compared to 2020.

Contracted services and professional fees were $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.2 million or 8% as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in contracted data processing, primarily related to system upgrades and product enhancements, a $1.4 million increase in audit, legal and consultant fees, and a $0.8 million increase in outside services, primarily attributable to marketing and new customer services.
Occupancy expense was $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.5 million or 2% as compared to 2020. This increase was due to a $0.5 million increase in utilities expense.

Card rewards program expense was $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.1 million or 14% as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in interchange fees paid to our credit card partners, a $0.6 million increase in priority rewards card redemptions and a $0.5 million increase in credit card cash reward redemptions. Card rewards program expense was $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $7.8 million or 26% as compared to 2019.

Decreased transactions and spending by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic led to decreased expenses for each of the aforementioned card reward programs.
Other noninterest expense was $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $18.7 million or 40% as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to $9.0 million in prepayment fees to terminate the Company’s FHLB fixed-rate advances, a $2.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily around supplies, insurance, meals and entertainment and shipping and delivery, a $2.2 million increase in software amortization expense, a $2.1 million settlement payment in connection to a lawsuit against the Company, a $1.5 million increase in pension-related expenses, a $0.5 million increase in broker fees, and $0.5 million in estimated PPP loan losses. Other noninterest expense was $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.3 million or 7% as compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.8 million decrease in pension-related expenses, a $1.0 million decrease in charitable contributions, a $0.8 million decrease in travel expenses, and a $0.6 million decrease in collection fees on delinquent consumer loans. This was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in software amortization expense.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $83.3 million (reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.86%) for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with a provision for income taxes of $58.0 million (reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.79%) in 2020. Additional information about the provision for income taxes is presented in “Note 15. Income Taxes” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Analysis of Business Segments
Our business segments are Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, and Treasury and Other. Table 8 summarizes net income (loss) from our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Additional information about operating segment performance is presented in “Note 22. Reportable Operating Segments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, established, among other COVID-19 relief programs, a loan program (the “PPP”) for fully guaranteed loans (which may then be forgiven) to small businesses. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company made changes to the internal measurement of segment operating profits for the purpose of evaluating segment performance and resource allocation. The primary reason for the change was to align PPP loan balances within the business segment that directly manages them. Specifically, PPP loan balances previously included as part of the Retail Banking segment have been reclassified to the Commercial Banking segment. The reallocation of select PPP loan balances affected net interest income, net interest income after provision for credit losses, noninterest expense, provision for income taxes, net income and asset balances. The Company has reported its selected financial information using the new PPP loan balance alignments for year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has restated the selected financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 in order to conform with the current presentation. As PPP loans were instituted in 2020, this reclassification had no impact to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Retail Banking. Our Retail Banking segment includes the financial products and services we provide to consumers, small businesses and certain commercial customers. Loan and lease products offered include residential and commercial mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and loans, automobile loans and leases, secured and unsecured lines of credit, installment loans, and small business loans and leases. Deposit products offered include checking, savings and time deposit accounts. Our Retail Banking segment also includes our wealth management services. Products and services from Retail Banking are delivered to customers through 54 banking locations throughout the State of Hawaii, Guam and Saipan.
Net income for the Retail Banking segment was $186.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $43.3 million or 30% as compared to 2020. The increase in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to the Provision. The Provision was a benefit of $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a Provision of $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income for the Retail Banking segment also stemmed from a $10.5 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $15.0 million increase in noninterest expense, a $14.9 million increase in the provision for income taxes and a $6.4 million decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in the Provision was largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher spread on our residential real estate loans. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher overall expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment, a settlement in connection with a lawsuit against the Company and an increase in equipment expense, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense and regulatory assessment and fees. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to decreases in gains on the sale of residential loans, trust and investment services income, service charges on deposit accounts and market adjustments for foreign exchange transactions, partially offset by an increase in other service charges and fees. The increase in total assets for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to an increase in residential real estate loans, partially offset by decreases in indirect automobile loans and other consumer loans.
Net income for the Retail Banking segment was $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $60.9 million or 30% as compared to 2019. The decrease in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a $46.5 million increase in the Provision, a $37.9 million decrease in net interest income and a $4.6 million increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $25.5 million decrease in the provision for income taxes and a $2.6 million increase in noninterest income. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher expected credit losses as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on our customers. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in transfer pricing credits on interest expenses from deposits as a result of lower yields on our deposit portfolio and lower spreads on our commercial and residential real estate portfolios. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher overall expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in pretax income. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in gains on the sale of residential loans and mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by a decrease in overdraft and checking account fees, an increase in amortization on mortgage servicing rights and a decrease in other service charges and fees. The decrease in total assets for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to the sale of residential mortgages and decreases in consumer loans.
Commercial Banking. Our Commercial Banking segment includes our corporate banking related products, residential and commercial real estate loans, commercial lease financing, secured and unsecured lines of credit, automobile loans and auto dealer financing, business deposit products and credit cards. Commercial lending and deposit products are offered primarily to middle-market and large companies locally, nationally and internationally.
Net income for the Commercial Banking segment was $119.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $45.8 million or 62% as compared to 2020. The increase in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to the Provision. The Provision was a benefit of $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a Provision of $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income for the Commercial Banking segment also stemmed from a $11.4 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $21.0 million increase in noninterest expense, a $15.6 million increase in the provision for income taxes and a $5.4 million decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in the Provision was largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in loan fees. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher overall expenses that were allocated to the Commercial Banking segment, and increases in salaries and benefits expense, card rewards program expense, supplies expense and estimated PPP loan losses. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to decreases in gains on the sale of commercial loans, customer-related interest rate swap fees and volume-based incentives, partially offset by increases in credit and debit card fees and other service charges and fees. The decrease in total assets for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to decreases in PPP loans and our dealer flooring portfolio, partially offset by increases in our commercial real estate and our Shared National Credits portfolios.
Net income for the Commercial Banking segment was $74.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $18.6 million or 20% as compared to 2019. The decrease in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a $46.4 million increase in the Provision, partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in net interest income, a $10.3 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, a $4.6 million increase in noninterest income and a $2.4 million decrease in noninterest expense. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher expected credit losses as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on our customers. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in loan fees and higher spread on our commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease in transfer pricing credits on interest expenses from deposits as a result of lower yields on our deposit portfolio. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in pretax income. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to gains on the sale of loans and increases in customer-related interest rate swap fees and volume-based incentives, partially offset by decreases in credit and debit card fees and other service charges and fees. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in card rewards program expense, partially offset by increases in contracted services expense and salaries and benefits expense, higher overall expenses that were allocated to the Commercial Banking segment, and an increase in other tax expense. The increase in total assets for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to PPP loans and an increase in construction loans, partially offset by decreases in our dealer flooring portfolios, Shared National Credits, indirect automobile loans and credit card balances.
Treasury and Other. Our Treasury and Other segment includes our treasury business, which consists of corporate asset and liability management activities, including interest rate risk management. The assets and liabilities (and related interest income and expense) of our treasury business consist of interest-bearing deposits, investment securities, federal funds sold and purchased, government deposits, short and long-term borrowings and bank-owned properties. Our primary sources of noninterest income are from BOLI, net gains from the sale of investment securities, foreign exchange income related to customer driven currency requests from merchants and island visitors and management of bank-owned properties in Hawaii and Guam. The net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in Treasury and Other, along with the elimination of intercompany transactions.
Other organizational units (Technology, Operations, Credit and Risk Management, Human Resources, Finance, Administration, Marketing, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) provide a wide range of support to our other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the applicable business segments through an internal cost allocation process.
Net loss for the Treasury and Other segment was $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase in net loss of $9.1 million as compared to 2020. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $27.1 million increase in net interest expense and a $1.9 million increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $15.4 million decrease in the Provision and a $5.2 million increase in the benefit for income taxes. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in net transfer pricing charges that reside in the Treasury and Other segment, partially offset by an increase in our investment securities portfolio average balance and a decrease in our borrowings. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to prepayment fees to terminate the Company’s FHLB fixed-rate advances, and increases in salaries and employee benefits expense, contracted services and professional fees, equipment expense, software amortization expense, occupancy expense, pension-related expenses, regulatory assessment and fees, advertising and marketing expense, other insurance expense and supplies expense, partially offset by higher overall credits that were allocated to the Treasury and Other segment. The decrease in the Provision was largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax loss. The increase in total assets for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to increases in our investment securities portfolio and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.
Net loss for the Treasury and Other segment was $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase in net loss of $19.1 million as compared to 2019. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $15.1 million increase in the Provision, a $10.2 million decrease in net interest income and a $2.3 million decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in noninterest expense and a $3.5 million increase in the benefit for income taxes. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher expected credit losses as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on our customers. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower earnings credits as a result of lower average yields in our loan portfolio and lower average yields in our investment securities portfolio and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, partially offset by a decrease in transfer pricing charges as a result of lower yields on our deposit portfolio. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to decreases in ATM surcharge fees, ATM interchange fees from customers and other service charges and fees, and insurance settlement income received in 2019, partially offset by a
decrease in net losses on the sale of investment securities as a result of the investment portfolio restructuring and sale of 48 investment securities in January 2019. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Treasury and Other segment, and decreases in pension-related expenses, advertising and marketing expenses, charitable contributions and occupancy expense, partially offset by increases in equipment expense, salaries and employee benefits expense, software amortization expense and contracted services and professional fees. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax loss. The increase in total assets for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to increases in our investment securities portfolio and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.
Analysis of Financial Condition
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity refers to our ability to maintain cash flow that is adequate to fund operations and meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or by obtaining additional funding through liability management. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength. Our objective is to manage our cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost.
Liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit, deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory and internal guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability and off-balance sheet positions. The Company’s Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.
Immediate liquid resources are available in cash which is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the “FRB”). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. The carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities were $8.4 billion and $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we maintained our excess liquidity primarily in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Municipal Housing Authorities. As of December 31, 2021, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with a weighted average life of approximately 5.8 years. These funds offer substantial resources to meet either new loan demand or to help offset reductions in our deposit funding base. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB. As of December 31, 2021, we have borrowing capacity of $1.8 billion from the FHLB and $1.1 billion from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged.
Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost of funding. Our core deposits, defined as all deposits exclusive of time deposits exceeding $250,000, totaled $21.0 billion and $17.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, which represented 96% and 93%, respectively, of our total deposits. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company; however, deposit levels could decrease if interest rates increase significantly or if corporate customers increase investing activities and reduce deposit balances.
Our material cash requirements from our current and long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:
Commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon; therefore, these items are not included in the table above. Purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations, including the systems and applications in the Bank’s new core system expected to be implemented in 2022. Postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to the postretirement benefit plan. Actual contributions may differ from these estimates.
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $204.1 million and $154.5 million, respectively. The increase in UTB was primarily due to additions related to state tax refund claims for periods during which the Company was the parent company for the state combined returns filed with BNPP and BOW. We are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As a result, our liability for UTBs is not disclosed in the table above.
See the discussion of credit, lease and other contractual commitments in “Note 4. Loans and Leases” and “Note 17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Other material cash requirements include general corporate operating activities, stock repurchases, and capital to be returned to our shareholders.
We expect to meet these obligations from dividends paid by the Bank to the Parent. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include selling residential real estate loans in the secondary market, taking out short- and long-term borrowings and issuing long-term debt and equity securities. At the start of the pandemic, we increased our liquidity position through additional public time deposits in anticipation of a surge in funding needs due to our participation in the PPP and other additional liquidity needs. While our public time deposits have since decreased from the fourth quarter of 2020, we have continued to maintain high levels of liquidity as of December 31, 2021. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, and cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next twelve months and beyond.
Potential Demands on Liquidity from Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have off-balance sheet arrangements, such as variable interest entities, guarantees, and certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, that may affect the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Variable Interest Entities
We hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing tax credit investments in partnerships and limited liability companies. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity’s net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. Based on our analysis, we have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. Unfunded commitments to fund these low-income housing tax credit investments were $62.6 million and $89.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Guarantees
We sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover: ownership of the loan; validity of the lien securing the loan; the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan; compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement; compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws; and other matters. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold was $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met in the origination of those loans. Upon receipt of a repurchase request, we work with investors to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred. We manage the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were two residential mortgage loan repurchases totaling $0.6 million and there were no pending repurchase requests.
In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, substantially all of the loans we sell to investors are sold with servicing rights retained. We also service loans originated by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans, or loan modifications or short sales. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor. These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company. Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had no repurchase requests related to loan servicing activities, nor were there any pending repurchase requests as of December 31, 2021.
Although to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions and servicing activities have been limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. However, as of December 31, 2021, management believes that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends and thus has not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases. As of December 31, 2021, 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for investors were current. We maintain ongoing communications with investors and continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in loans sold to investors.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
See “Note 17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.
Investment Securities
Table 10 presents the estimated fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Table 11 presents the maturity distribution at amortized cost and weighted-average yield to maturity of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021:
(1) Weighted-average yields were computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
(2) Maturities for mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations anticipate future prepayments.
The fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.4 billion or 39% compared to December 31, 2020. The higher balances in investment securities were primarily due to deploying excess balance sheet liquidity. Our available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) or through the Provision.
As of December 31, 2021, we maintained all of our investment securities in the available-for-sale category recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, with $4.7 billion invested in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our available-for-sale portfolio also included $3.4 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Municipal Housing Authorities, $192.6 million in debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and government agencies (U.S. International Development Finance Corporation bonds), $105.2 million in collateralized loan obligations and $44.2 million in debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions.
We continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities and change the composition of our investment securities portfolio.
Gross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $24.6 million and $97.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio were $157.3 million and $10.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in unrealized loss and decrease in unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio was primarily due to higher market interest rates as of December 31, 2021, relative to December 31, 2020, resulting in a lower valuation. Additionally, the increase in unrealized loss and decrease in unrealized gain positions were primarily related to our collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities, the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
We conduct a regular assessment of our investment securities portfolio to determine whether any securities are impaired. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and the ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through the ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not record any credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio.
We are required to hold non-marketable equity securities, comprised of FHLB stock, as a condition of our membership in the FHLB system. Our FHLB stock is accounted for at cost, which equals par or redemption value. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held $10.1 million and $18.1 million in FHLB stock, respectively, which is recorded as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
See “Note 3. Investment Securities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our investment securities portfolio.
Loans and Leases
Table 12 presents the composition of our loan and lease portfolio by major categories as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Total loans and leases were $13.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $317.1 million or 2% from December 31, 2020, with decreases in commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans and lease financing, partially offset by increases in commercial real estate loans, construction loans and residential real estate loans. The decrease in total loans and leases was primarily due to our participation in the PPP which had a total amortized cost basis of $216.4 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $584.8 million from December 31, 2020. It is possible that the continued effects of COVID-19 on the economy could result in less demand for our loan products.
Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes. We also offer a variety of automobile dealer flooring lines to our customers in Hawaii and California to assist with the financing of their inventory. Commercial and industrial loans were $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $932.4 million or 31% from December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in PPP loans, as well as a reduction in dealer flooring balances, partially offset by an increase in our Shared National Credits during the year. The decrease in dealer flooring balances was driven by the global chip shortage that has been adversely impacting the automobile industry.
Commercial real estate loans are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan to value (“LTV”) ratios generally not exceeding 75% and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1. The commercial properties are predominantly apartments, neighborhood and grocery anchored retail, industrial, office, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property and owner occupied property is cash flow from the property and the operating cash flow from the business, respectively. Commercial real estate loans were $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $246.9 million or 7% from December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in U.S. Mainland commercial real estate loans during the year.
Construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. Loans in this portfolio are primarily for the purchase of land, as well as for the development of commercial properties, single family homes and condominiums. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if a loan is retained by the Bank, the loan is reclassified to the commercial real estate or residential real estate classes of loans. Construction loans were $814.0 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $78.2 million or 11% from December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in U.S. Mainland and Hawaii construction loan draws during the year.
Residential real estate loans are generally secured by 1-4 unit residential properties and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income (“DTI”) ratios, liquidity and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer fixed rate mortgage products and variable rate mortgage products with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth or tenth year, depending on the product and are based on LIBOR. Variable rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We generally do not offer interest-only, payment-option facilities, Alt-A loans or any product with negative amortization. Residential real estate loans were $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $428.1 million or 9% from December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in residential mortgages of $393.1 million and home equity lines of $35.0 million during the year.
Consumer loans consist primarily of open- and closed-end direct and indirect credit facilities for personal, automobile and household purchases as well as credit card loans. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in consumer lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines, which include an evaluation of personal credit history, cash flow and collateral values based on existing market conditions. Consumer loans were $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $123.9 million or 9% from December 31, 2020. The decrease in consumer loans was primarily due to decreases in indirect automobile loans and other unsecured consumer loans.
Lease financing consists of commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases. Underwriting of new lease transactions is based on our lending policy, including but not limited to an analysis of customer cash flows and secondary sources of repayment, including the value of leased equipment, the guarantors’ cash flows and/or other credit enhancements. No new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Lease financing was $231.4 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $14.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2020. The reduction was reflective of weak demand for new business equipment and vehicles in the Hawaii market coupled with supply chain disruption causing significant delays in deliveries of new orders.
See “Note 4. Loans and Leases” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the discussion in “Analysis of Financial Condition - Allowance for Credit Losses” of this MD&A for more information on our loan and lease portfolio.
The Company’s loan and lease portfolio includes adjustable-rate loans, primarily tied to Prime and LIBOR, hybrid rate loans, for which the initial rate is fixed for a period from one year to as much as ten years, and fixed rate loans, for which the interest rate does not change through the life of the loan. Table 13 presents the recorded investment in our loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2021:
Tables 14 and 15 present the geographic distribution of our loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1) For secured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on where the collateral is located. For unsecured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on the location where the majority of the borrower's business operations are conducted.
(1) For secured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on where the collateral is located. For unsecured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on the location where the majority of the borrower's business operations are conducted.
Our lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii. However, we also have lending activities on the U.S. mainland, Guam and Saipan. Our commercial lending activities on the U.S. mainland include automobile dealer flooring activities in California, participation in the Shared National Credits Program and selective commercial real estate projects based on existing customer relationships. Our lease financing portfolio includes commercial leveraged and single investor lease financing activities both in Hawaii and on the U.S. mainland. However, no new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Our consumer lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii and to a smaller extent, Guam and Saipan.
Table 16 presents certain contractual loan maturity categories and sensitivities of those loans to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2021:
(1) Based on contractual maturities, including extension and renewal options that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
Credit Quality
We evaluate certain loans and leases, including commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction loans, individually for impairment and non-accrual status. A loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. We generally place a loan on non-accrual status when management believes that collection of principal or interest has become doubtful or when a loan or lease becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest, unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans on non-accrual status are generally classified as impaired, but not all impaired loans are necessarily placed on non-accrual status. See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our credit quality indicators.
For purposes of managing credit risk and estimating the ACL, management has identified three categories of loans (commercial, residential real estate and consumer) that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the ACL. The categorization of loans for the evaluation of credit risk is specific to our credit risk evaluation process and these loan categories are not necessarily the same as the loan categories used for other evaluations of our loan portfolio. See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our approach to estimating the ACL.
The following tables and discussion address non-performing assets, loans and leases that are 90 days past due but are still accruing interest, impaired loans and loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring.
Non-Performing Assets and Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest
Table 17 presents information on our Non-Performing Assets (“NPAs”) and Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Table 18 presents the activity in NPAs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The level of NPAs represents an indicator of the potential for future credit losses. NPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases and OREO. Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to held for sale classification, transferred to OREO or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.
Total NPAs were $7.3 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.8 million or 20% from December 31, 2020. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases and OREO was 0.06% as of December 31, 2021, a one basis point decrease from December 31, 2020. The decrease in total NPAs was primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in construction loans and a $0.8 million decrease in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in commercial real estate loans and $0.2 million increase in both commercial and industrial loans and OREO.
The largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans. The level of these NPAs remains elevated due to a lengthy judicial foreclosure process in Hawaii. As of December 31, 2021, residential mortgage non-accrual loans were $5.6 million, a decrease of $0.8 million or 12% from December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 32 loans with a weighted average current loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 43%.
Construction non-accrual loans were nil as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.0 million from December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to a $1.8 million transfer to loans held for sale and payments of $0.6 million, offset by an addition of $0.4 million.
Commercial and industrial non-accrual loans were $0.7 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.2 million or 39% from December 31, 2020. This increase was due to additions in commercial and industrial loans totaling $0.5 million, offset by $0.2 million in payments and $0.1 million in charge-offs.
Commercial real estate non-accrual loans were $0.7 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.6 million from December 31, 2020. This increase was due to additions in commercial real estate loans totaling $0.8 million, offset by $0.2 million in payments.
OREO represents property acquired as a result of borrower defaults on loans. OREO is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2021, OREO was $0.2 million which comprised of one residential property. As of December 31, 2020, we did not hold any OREO.
Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest. Loans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection.
Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $7.2 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $4.0 million or 35% as compared to December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in consumer loans of $1.5 million, commercial and industrial loans of $1.4 million, home equity lines of $1.1 million and commercial real estate loans of $0.9 million that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest during the year ended December 31, 2021. This was partially offset by an increase in residential mortgages that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Impaired Loans. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For a loan that has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement, not the contractual terms specified by the modified loan agreement.
Impaired loans were $42.2 million and $25.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These impaired loans had a related ACL of $4.2 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in impaired loans during 2021 was primarily due to increases in consumer loans of $15.7 million, residential mortgage loans of $1.8 million and commercial real estate loans of $0.6 million, offset by decreases in construction loans of $1.4 million and commercial and industrial loans of $0.3 million. The change in impaired loan balance includes charge-offs and paydowns. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charge-offs of $1.8 million and $16.8 million, respectively, related to our total impaired loans. Our impaired loans are considered in management’s assessment of the overall adequacy of the ACL.
If interest due on the balances of all non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2021 had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $0.3 million in additional interest income would have been recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $1.0 million in additional interest income would have been recorded for 2020. Actual interest income recorded on these loans was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
COVID-19 Financial Hardship Relief Programs
Certain borrowers were unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the adverse effects of COVID-19. To help mitigate these effects, we offered various relief programs to assist customers who experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19. For example, for certain residential mortgage and commercial loans, various relief options were available on a case-by-case basis, including payment deferrals for up to six months. For certain consumer loans, loan assistance was being offered in the form of payment deferrals for up to three months, which extended the term of the loan by the number of months deferred, and interest continued to accrue on the principal balance. The short-term modifications for payment deferrals, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment described above that were insignificant and made on a good faith basis in response to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 who were current prior to any relief were not required to be accounted for and disclosed as TDRs under GAAP. Please see “Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion on short-term modifications.
Table 19 presents information on the portion of our loans and leases balance as of December 31, 2021 that received payment deferrals under our COVID-19 financial hardship relief programs:
In addition to the relief programs described above, we are also participating in the PPP offered by the SBA. The PPP is intended to help small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic by providing “fully forgivable” loans to cover payroll expenses, including employee benefits, and can also be used for various other eligible expenses. PPP loans have a fixed interest rate of one percent per annum and a maturity date of up to five years, with the ability to prepay the loan in full without penalty. The first payment is deferred for 10 months or until compensation is received for forgiven amounts, and interest will continue to accrue during the initial deferment period. The borrower may apply with the Bank for loan forgiveness of the amount due on the loan in an amount equal to payroll, employee benefits, and other eligible expenses incurred, subject to limitations, in accordance with the PPP and CARES Act, as amended by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (“PPPF Act”) and CAA. Because the purpose of the PPP is to help small businesses keep their workers employed and paid, if the business spends less than 60% of loan proceeds on payroll costs, uses the loan proceeds for non-payroll costs that are not eligible expenses, or significantly reduces its employee count or compensation levels without qualifying for other exceptions, a portion of the loan will not be forgiven, and the business will be required to repay that portion of the loan to the Bank over the remaining term of the loan.
Table 20 presents information on our PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, to borrowers operating in industries we consider to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (“high impact industries”) and all other industries:
(1) “All other industries” represent borrowers that received PPP loans that did not operate in the five high impact industries listed above. At December 31, 2021, this was primarily comprised of the construction, health care, administrative and support services, and arts and entertainment industries. At December 31, 2020, this was primarily comprised of the construction, health care, professional services, and administrative and support services industries.
(2) At December 31, 2021, outstanding loan balances are reported net of deferred loan costs and fees of $0.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, outstanding loan balances are reported net of deferred loan costs and fees of $1.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively.
Loans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring
Table 21 presents information on loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Loans modified in a TDR were $36.3 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $19.3 million from 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in consumer loans of $15.7 million, residential mortgages of $3.3 million and construction loans of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, $34.9 million or 96% of our loans modified in a TDR were performing in accordance with their modified contractual terms and were on accrual status.
Generally, loans modified in a TDR are returned to accrual status after the borrower has demonstrated performance under the modified terms by making six consecutive timely payments. See “Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and “Analysis of Financial Condition - COVID-19 Financial Hardship Relief Programs” for more information and a description of the modification programs that we have been offering to our customers.
As noted above, we have been providing our borrowers with opportunities to defer payments, or portions thereof. In the absence of intervening factors, such short-term modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings, nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to COVID-19 reported as past due or placed on non-accrual status (provided the loans were not past due or on non-accrual status prior to the deferral).
Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans and Leases & Reserve for Unfunded Commitments
We adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. This guidance changes the accounting for credit losses from an “incurred loss” model, which estimates a loss allowance based on current known and inherent losses within a loan portfolio to an “expected loss” model, which estimates a loss based on losses expected to be recorded over the life of the loan portfolio.
Effective January 1, 2020, we recorded a pre-tax cumulative effect adjustment to increase the ACL by $0.8 million and to increase the reserve for unfunded commitments by $16.3 million. The Company’s ACL under CECL is significantly more dependent on the quantitative model and less on the qualitative assessment, compared to the previous incurred loss model. The increase in the ACL was primarily related to our indirect auto, commercial real estate and consumer loan products. This was partially offset by the decrease in the ACL related to our commercial and industrial, home equity lines and residential real estate loan products. These directional changes were predominantly due to differences between the loss emergence periods previously used under the incurred loss methodology and the remaining life of the loan as required under CECL. The large increase to our reserve for unfunded commitments was primarily due to an increase in utilization rates estimated using our CECL methodology.
Table 22 presents an analysis of our ACL for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Tables 23 and 24 present the allocation of the ACL by loan category, in both dollars and as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Table 25 presents the net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans and leases by category during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
As of December 31, 2021, the ACL was $157.3 million or 1.21% of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an ACL of $208.5 million or 1.57% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The level of the ACL was commensurate with the adverse impacts that COVID-19 is having on the Hawaii and global economy.
Net charge-offs of loans and leases were $12.5 million or 0.10% of total average loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $30.9 million or 0.23% for 2020. Net charge-offs in our commercial lending portfolio were $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net charge-offs of $12.9 million for 2020. Net charge-offs in our residential lending portfolio were $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net recoveries of $0.3 million for 2020. Net charge-offs in our consumer lending portfolio were $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net charge-offs of $18.3 million for 2020. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolio segment include those related to credit card, automobile loans, installment loans and small business lines of credit and reflect the inherent risk associated with these loans.
The decrease in the ACL was primarily due to lower expected credit losses as the economic outlook and credit quality improved in 2021 compared to 2020. However, we still retained a COVID-19 related overlay as a component of the ACL as Hawaii’s economy continues to be significantly impacted by COVID-19. As noted earlier, a significant number of our customers (primarily individuals and small businesses) have taken advantage of payment deferral programs in assisting them while they may be temporarily unemployed or while their businesses have closed. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our tourism industry and the re-opening of the Hawaii economy under new guidelines. While we have begun to see and may continue to see a gradual improvement in unemployment as local businesses and the Hawaii tourism industry continues to reopen and the COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely administered, the timing and extent of the return of air travel and the recovery of the Hawaii tourism industry is highly uncertain and beyond our control.
Although we determine the amount of each component of the ACL separately, the ACL as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2021, while the allocation of our ACL to our commercial, residential and consumer portfolio segments was lower as compared to December 31, 2020, the ACL was considered adequate based on our ongoing analysis of estimated expected credit losses, credit risk profiles, current economic outlook, coverage ratios and other relevant factors. We will continue to monitor factors that drive expected credit losses including COVID-19 and the impact on the Hawaii economy, local businesses and our customers.
See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the ACL.
Goodwill
Goodwill was $995.5 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our goodwill originated from the acquisition of the Company by BNPP in December of 2001. Goodwill generated in that acquisition was recorded on the balance sheet of the Bank as a result of push down accounting treatment, and remains on our consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or between annual assessments if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Company performed its annual assessment of the criteria included in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, and based on such assessment, the Company concluded that there was no impairment in our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021. Future events, including the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, that could cause a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in our business or the business climate may necessitate taking charges in future reporting periods related to the impairment of our goodwill.
Other Assets
Other assets were $643.2 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $39.8 million or 7% from December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $50.5 million increase in current tax receivables and deferred tax assets, a $33.0 million increase in interest-earning advances and a $30.3 million increase in prepaid expenses. This was partially offset by a $79.0 million decrease in interest rate swap agreements.
Deposits
Deposits are the primary funding source for the Bank and are acquired from a broad base of local markets, including both individual and corporate customers. We obtain funds from depositors by offering a range of deposit types, including demand, savings, money market and time.
Table 26 presents the composition of our deposits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1) Foreign deposits were comprised of Guam and Saipan deposit accounts.
(2) Public deposits were $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $532.7 million or 32% compared to December 31, 2020.
Total deposits were $21.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.6 billion or 14% from December 31, 2020. The increase in deposit balances stemmed primarily from a $1.9 billion increase in non-public demand deposit balances, a $845.6 million increase in non-public savings deposit balances and a $695.8 million increase in non-public money market deposit balances. These increases are partially offset by a $571.9 million decrease in total time deposit balances and a $252.9 million decrease in public savings deposit balances.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $14.7 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits.
Table 27 presents the amount of time deposits that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, further segregated by time remaining until maturity, as of December 31, 2021:
Long-term Borrowings
As of December 31, 2021, there were no long-term borrowings compared to $200.0 million in long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s long-term borrowings were terminated in November 2021 and were comprised of $200.0 million in FHLB fixed-rate advances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.73% and original maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2024. Long-term borrowings mature in excess of one year from the consolidated balance sheet date.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had an undrawn line of credit of $1.8 billion from the FHLB. As of December 31, 2020, the available remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $2.0 billion. The FHLB borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2021 and the fixed-rate advances and remaining borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2020 were secured by residential real estate loan collateral.
Pension and Postretirement Plan Obligations
We have a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan for certain key executives (“SERP”), a directors’ retirement plan, a non-qualified pension plan for eligible directors and a postretirement benefit plan providing life insurance and healthcare benefits that we offer to our directors and employees, as applicable. The qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, the SERP and the directors’ retirement plan are all frozen plans to new participants. In March 2019, the Company’s board of directors approved an amendment to the SERP to freeze the SERP, which became effective on July 1, 2019. As a result of the amendment, since the effective date, there have not been any, and there will be no, new accruals of benefits, including service accruals. Existing benefits under the SERP, as of the effective date of the amendment described above, will otherwise continue in accordance with the terms of the SERP. To calculate annual pension costs, we use the following key variables: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate.
Pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations, net of pension plan assets, were $119.2 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $7.9 million or 6% from December 31, 2020. The balance as of December 31, 2021 included retirement benefits payable of $134.5 million for the Company’s underfunded plans, partially offset by pension plan assets for overfunded plans, recorded as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, of $15.3 million.
See “Note 14. Benefit Plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to the Capital Rules, which implemented the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than previously required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) impose a capital measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and ‘‘Additional Tier 1 capital’’ instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.
The Capital Rules also require a 2.5% capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 10.5% total capital to risk-weighted assets.
As of December 31, 2021, our capital levels remained characterized as “well capitalized” under the Capital Rules. Our regulatory capital ratios, calculated in accordance with the Capital Rules, are presented in Table 28 below. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2021 that management believes have changed either the Company’s or the Bank’s capital classifications.
Total stockholders’ equity was $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $87.2 million or 3% from December 31, 2020. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to dividends declared and paid to the Company’s stockholders of $134.1 million, a net loss in the fair value of our investment securities of $160.6 million and common stock repurchased of $75.0 million. This was partially offset by earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $265.7 million.
In February 2021, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to $75.0 million of its outstanding common stock during 2021. Under this plan, the Company repurchased 2,679,532 shares at a total cost of approximately $75.0 million during 2021. In January 2022, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to $75.0 million of its outstanding common stock during 2022. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, are influenced by various internal and external factors.
In January 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share on our outstanding shares. The dividend is to be paid on March 4, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2022.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in “Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements are those that are related to the determination of the ACL, goodwill, fair value estimates, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, significant reliance on estimated loss rates on portfolios and consideration of our evaluation of macro-economic factors and trends. While our methodology in establishing the ACL attributes portions of the ACL to the commercial, residential real estate and consumer portfolio segments, the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses in the total loan and lease portfolio.
The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected from loans and leases. Loans and leases are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan or lease balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related Provision, can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considers changes in economic conditions, customer behavior, and collateral value, among other factors. From time to time, economic factors or business decisions may affect the composition and mix of the loan and lease portfolio, causing management to increase or decrease the ACL.
The following are some of the significant judgments and inherent limitations which affect the estimate of the ACL:
● The Accuracy of Internal Credit Risk Ratings, Monitoring of Loans Past Due and Delinquency Trends. The ACL related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of internal credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists.
● Data. We have applied considerable judgments about the sufficiency and applicability of our internal data to provide an accurate view of historical loss information. For each of our portfolio segments we have examined between 8 and 12 years of historical data. For many of our residential real estate and consumer loan classes, we have assumed that the historical loss period observed is sufficient to capture a full credit loss cycle and that the credit loss exposures observed over this historical loss period are representative of those for which we will be making estimates of future expected credit losses under CECL. In making this assumption, we have relied on the fact that the historical loss period incorporated the most recent observed recessionary period as well as the subsequent period of sustained recovery and growth.
● Reasonable and Supportable Forecast Period. For contractual periods which extend beyond the one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, management elected an immediate reversion to the mean approach. Management will continue to assess whether a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period is appropriate. Changes to the economic environment and uncertainty with regards to the timing and extent of an economic recovery may result in management decreasing or increasing the current reasonable and supportable forecast period.
● Economic Adjustments over the Reasonable and Supportable Forecast Period. The Company’s economic forecast team meets at least quarterly to discuss the economic outlook over the reasonable and supportable forecast period and determines whether economic adjustments should be applied in estimating the total ACL. The adjustments could be attributable to forecasted levels of local and national employment, visitor arrivals and spending, interest rates and real estate prices. Various economic forecasts ranging from mild, medium to severe are evaluated to forecast losses over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Such adjustments are highly subjective and are a result of significant management judgment.
● Qualitative Adjustments. For risks not captured in the long-run default rates or in the economic forecast over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company applies segment level dollar adjustments. These adjustments are estimated based on the best information available as of the reporting date and may include, as appropriate, adjustments for model limitations, regulatory determinants, overlays for natural disasters, and other events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
● Identification and Measurement of Individually Assessed Loans, including Loans Modified in a TDR. Our experienced senior credit officers may consider a loan impaired based on their evaluation of current information and events, including loans modified in a TDR. The measurement of impairment is typically based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows. The development of these expectations requires significant management judgment and estimation.
The ACL for loans and leases was $157.3 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a decrease of $51.2 million, compared to the ACL for loans and leases of $208.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $30.3 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a decrease of $0.3 million, compared to the reserve for unfunded commitments of $30.6 million as of December 31, 2020. These decreases were primarily due to improvements in the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio and lower expected credit losses as a result of the economic recovery and easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To illustrate the sensitivity of the Company’s ACL model to credit quality, we downgraded the internal credit risk ratings on commercial loans by one grade and reduced FICO scores on retail loans by ten points. Downgrading 1% of our commercial portfolio would increase the ACL at December 31, 2021 by approximately $1.4 million, and reducing FICO scores on the entire retail portfolio would increase the ACL at December 31, 2021 by approximately $4.9 million. These sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and have been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in internal credit risk ratings and FICO scores may have on the ACL estimate, with all other inputs remaining constant.
See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data and “Analysis of Financial Condition - Allowance for Credit Losses” for more information on the ACL.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company’s policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at December 31 or between annual assessments if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, and an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited.
The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using valuation methods based on the market and income approaches:
● The market approach involves the calculation of valuation multiples of comparable public companies (e.g., based on market capitalization, net income, book equity and tangible book equity). Because the initial fair value determined under the market approach represents a noncontrolling interest, a control premium is applied to arrive at the estimated fair value on a controlling basis. The key assumptions with respect to this method are the selected multiples and control premium.
● The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) method to value a company on a going concern basis. The DCF method is based on the present value of (1) multi-period projections of free cash flows and (2) a terminal value. The sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value represents the fair value of the reporting unit under the income approach. The projected cash flows and terminal value are converted to present value through applying a discount rate. The key assumptions with respect to this method are the determination of the free cash flows, discount rate and terminal value.
The Company performed its annual quantitative impairment test in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, and based on such assessment, the Company concluded that there was no impairment in our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant judgment and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions that could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, including the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our reporting units in relation to their carrying amounts and could necessitate taking charges in future reporting periods related to the impairment of our goodwill.
Because there was no impairment for the current year ended December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance remained unchanged at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020.
To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate assumption across each of the Company’s reporting units would not have resulted in a fair value below the respective reporting unit’s carrying value.
See “Note 7. Other Assets” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on goodwill.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy defines Level 1 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.
Financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available for sale investment securities, and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8.5 billion or 34% and $6.2 billion or 27%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available for sale investment securities measured using information from a third-party pricing service. These investments in debt securities and mortgage backed securities were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $6.8 million or less than 1% and $5.8 million or less than 1%, respectively, of our total liabilities, consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and $5.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the liability which was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy was related to the sale of our Visa Class B restricted shares in 2016. We recorded a derivative liability which requires payment to the buyer of the Visa Class B restricted shares in the event Visa further reduces the conversion rate to its publicly traded Visa Class A shares.
Our third-party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions or defects. As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third-party pricing service:
(1) Our third-party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities. We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy. This documentation is periodically updated by our third-party pricing service. Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy.
(2) On a monthly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third-party pricing service. This review process includes a comparison to non-binding third-party broker quotes, as well as a review of market related conditions impacting the information provided by our third-party pricing service. We also identify investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades relative to historic levels, as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets. As of December 31, 2021, management did not make adjustments to prices provided by our third-party pricing service as a result of illiquid or inactive markets.
(3) On an annual basis, to the extent available, we obtain and review independent auditor's reports from our third-party pricing service related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness. We did not note any significant control deficiencies in our review of the independent auditors’ reports related to services rendered by our third-party pricing service.
(4) Our third-party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices. Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third-party pricing service. Our third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us. Our third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis.
Based on the composition of our investment securities portfolio, we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements by our third-party pricing service. See “Note 21. Fair Value” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our use of fair value estimates.
Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We use the following key variables to calculate annual pension costs: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate. Pension cost is directly affected by the number of employees eligible for pension benefits and their estimated compensation increases. To calculate estimated compensation increases, management reviews our salary increases each year and compares this data with industry information. For all pension and postretirement plan calculations, we use a measurement date of December 31.
The expected long-term rate of return was based on a calculated rate of return from average rates of return on various asset classes over a 20-year historical time horizon. Using long-term historical data allows the Company to capture multiple economic environments, which management believes is relevant when using historical returns. Net actuarial gains or losses that exceed a 5% corridor of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost on a straight-line basis over five years.
In estimating the projected benefit obligation, an independent actuary bases assumptions on factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and other assumptions related to the population of individuals in the pension plan. If significant actuarial gains or losses occur, the actuary reviews the demographic and economic assumptions with management, at which time the Company considers revising these assumptions based on actual results.
Our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash outflows for benefit payments and cash inflows for maturities and return on plan assets. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. The discount rate assumption is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rate assumption used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year end is the rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.
The projected benefit obligation for pension benefits was $204.4 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a decrease of $15.0 million, compared to the projected benefit obligation for pension benefits of $219.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other benefits was $21.4 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a decrease of $1.1 million, compared to the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other benefits of $22.5 million as of December 31, 2020.
To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, if the discount rate assumption decreased by 100 basis points, the projected benefit obligation for pension benefits and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other benefits at December 31, 2021 would increase by approximately $19.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
See “Note 14. Benefit Plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations.
Income Taxes
In estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position. Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position. These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our consolidated statements of income and balance sheets.
Management's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
We are also required to record a liability for UTBs for the entire amount of a tax benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our liabilities for UTBs were $204.1 million and $154.5 million, respectively. See “Note 15. Income Taxes” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on income taxes.
Future Application of Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not adopted by us as of December 31, 2021, see “Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.
Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Managing risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management and operational risk. See “Analysis of Financial Condition - Liquidity” and “-Capital” sections of this MD&A for further discussions of liquidity risk management and capital management, respectively.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial, real estate and consumer credit policies, risk ratings and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers’ borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history.
Management has identified three categories of loans that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the ACL: commercial, residential and consumer.
Commercial lending is further categorized into four distinct classes based on characteristics relating to the borrower, transaction and collateral. These classes are: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, construction and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes by medium to larger Hawaii based corporations, as well as U.S. mainland and international companies. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by non-real estate assets whereby the collateral is trading assets, enterprise value or inventory. As with many of our customers, our commercial and industrial loan customers are heavily dependent on tourism, government expenditures and real estate values. Commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate, including but not limited to structures and facilities to support activities designated as retail, health care, general office space, warehouse and industrial space. Our Bank’s underwriting policy generally requires that net cash flows from the property be sufficient to service the debt while still maintaining an appropriate amount of reserves. Commercial real estate loans in Hawaii are characterized by having a limited supply of real estate at commercially attractive locations, long delivery time frames for development and high interest rate sensitivity. Our construction lending portfolio consists primarily of land loans, single family and condominium development loans. Financing of construction loans is subject to a high degree of credit risk given the long delivery time frames for such projects. Construction lending activities are underwritten on a project financing basis whereby the cash flows or lease rents from the underlying real estate collateral or the sale of the finished inventory is the primary source of repayment. Market feasibility analysis is typically performed by assessing market comparables, market conditions and demand in the specific lending area and general community. We require presales of finished inventory prior to loan funding. However, because this analysis is typically performed on a forward-looking basis, real estate construction projects typically present a higher risk profile in our lending activities. Lease financing activities include commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases used to purchase items ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. Underwriting of new leasing arrangements typically includes analyzing customer cash flows, evaluating secondary sources of repayment, such as the value of the leased asset, the guarantors’ net cash flows as well as other credit enhancements provided by the lessee.
Residential lending is further categorized into the following classes: residential mortgages (loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties and home equity loans) and home equity lines of credit. Our Bank’s underwriting standards typically require LTV ratios of not more than 80%, although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance. First mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk, with an average loan size of approximately $377,000. Residential mortgage loan production is added to our loan portfolio or is sold in the secondary market, based on management’s evaluation of our liquidity, capital and loan portfolio mix as well as market conditions. Changes in interest rates, the economic environment and other market factors have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, the marketability and value of collateral and the financial condition of our borrowers which impacts the level of credit risk inherent in this portfolio, although we remain in a supply constrained housing environment in Hawaii. Geographic concentrations exist for this portfolio as nearly all residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are for residences located in Hawaii, Guam or Saipan. These island locales are susceptible to a wide array of potential natural disasters including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes. We offer home equity lines of credit with variable rates; fixed rate lock options may be available post-closing. All lines are underwritten at 2% over the fully indexed rate. Our procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of an applicant’s overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on repayment ability via debt-to-income ratios, LTV ratios and an evaluation of credit history.
Consumer lending is further categorized into the following classes of loans: credit cards, automobile loans and other consumer-related installment loans. Consumer loans are either unsecured or secured by the borrower’s personal assets. The average loan size is generally small and risk is diversified among many borrowers. We offer a wide array of credit cards for business and personal use. In general, our customers are attracted to our credit card offerings on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs and other product features. Credit card underwriting decisions are generally based on repayment ability of our borrower via DTI ratios, credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and analysis of financial capacity. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate the majority of our automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant’s overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan or lease. Although an applicant’s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured. Installment loans consist of open and closed end facilities for personal and household purchases. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in installment lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines which include an evaluation of personal credit history and cash flow.
In addition to geographic concentration risk, we also monitor our exposure to industry risk. While the Bank, our customers and our results of operations could be adversely impacted by events affecting the tourism industry, we also monitor our other industry exposures, including, but not limited to, our exposures in the oil, gas and energy industries. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have material exposures to customers in the oil, gas and energy industries.
Market Risk
Market risk is the potential of loss arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates.
The potential cash flows, sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In the banking industry, changes in interest rates can significantly impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity.
Interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. This occurs when our interest earning loans and interest-bearing deposits mature or reprice at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rates may also affect loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, pre- payment speeds and other items affecting earnings.
Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.
Market Risk Measurement
We primarily use net interest income simulation analysis to measure and analyze interest rate risk. We run various hypothetical interest rate scenarios and compare these results against a measured base case scenario. Our net interest income simulation analysis incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments on and off-balance sheet, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices and (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset liability management strategies to manage our interest rate risk.
 
Table 29 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2021 and 2020, an estimate of the changes in net interest income that would result from ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (immediate changes) in market interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. Ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base case scenario. Shock scenarios assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates across the entire yield curve, relative to the base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged. We evaluate the sensitivity by using a static forecast, where the balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are held constant.
The table above shows the effects of a simulation which estimates the effect of a gradual and immediate sustained parallel shift in the yield curve of −100, −50, +50 and +100 basis points in market interest rates over a twelve-month period on our net interest income.
Currently, our interest rate profile is such that we project net interest income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities.
Under the static balance sheet forecast as of December 31, 2021, our net interest income sensitivity profile is slightly lower in higher interest rate scenarios compared to similar forecasts as of December 31, 2020. The sensitivity outcomes described above are primarily due to changes in the balance sheet mix as of December 31, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2020.
The comparisons above provide insight into the potential effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income. The Company believes that its approach to interest rate risk has appropriately considered its susceptibility to both rising and falling rates and has adopted strategies which minimize the impact of such risks.
We also have longer term interest rate risk exposures which may not be appropriately measured by net interest income simulation analysis. We use market value of equity (“MVE”) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. MVE involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our MVE. MVE analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario, which will impact the discounted present value. The amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing option risk in the balance sheet.
Limitations of Market Risk Measures
The results of our simulation analyses are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from those projected, our net interest income might vary significantly. Non-parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause our net interest income to be different from that depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other short-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or faster than our assets re-price. Actual results could differ from those projected if we grow assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if we experience a net outflow of deposits or if our mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. For example, while we maintain relatively high levels of liquidity, a faster than expected withdrawal of deposits out of the bank may cause us to seek higher cost sources of funding. Actual results could also differ from those projected if we experience substantially different prepayment speeds in our loan portfolio than those assumed in the simulation analyses. Finally, these simulation results do not consider all the actions that we may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to our loan, investment, deposit, funding or hedging strategies.
Market Risk Governance
We seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from changes in market interest rates. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to increase net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
To manage the impact on net interest income, we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates through our asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our ALCO and approved by our board of directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposures. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
Through review and oversight by the ALCO, we attempt to engage in strategies that neutralize interest rate risk as much as possible. Our use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in “Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.
Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines.
In addition, our business relies upon a large volume of loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in “new” contracts by December 31, 2021 at the latest. Although the full impact of alternatives to LIBOR on the valuations, pricing and operation of our financial instruments is not yet known, we have established a working group, consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the Company, to spearhead the continued transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. In the United States, LIBOR-priced transactions and products will transfer to the SOFR, Prime Rate or other similar indices (collectively, “Alternative Rates”). There are risks inherent with the transition to any Alternative Rate as the rate may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events.
Our LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including work to ensure that our technology systems are prepared for the transition, our loan documents that reference LIBOR-based rates have been appropriately amended to reference other methods of interest rate determinations and internal and external stakeholders are apprised of the transition. We have implemented certain SOFR conventions and are in the process of developing other products and transaction agreements that are based on reference rates other than LIBOR.
For a further discussion of the various risks the Company faces in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see “Risk Factors-Market Risks-Certain of our businesses, our funding and financial products may be adversely affected by changes or the discontinuance of LIBOR.”
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (such as natural disasters), or compliance, reputational or legal matters, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. Operational risk is inherent in all of our business ventures and the management of that risk is important to the achievement of our objectives. We have a framework in place that includes the reporting and assessment of any operational risk events, and the assessment of our mitigating strategies within our key business lines. This framework is implemented through our policies, processes and reporting requirements. We measure and report operational risk using the seven operational risk event types projected by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel II: (1) external fraud; (2) internal fraud; (3) employment practices and workplace safety; (4) clients, products and business practices; (5) damage to physical assets; (6) business disruption and system failures; and (7) execution, delivery and process management. Our operational risk review process is also a core part of our assessment of material new products or activities.
