LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our current assets were $13,892,681 and $1,251,029, respectively, and our current liabilities were $9,998,194 and $15,660,748, respectively, which resulted in a working capital surplus of $3,894,487 and working capital deficit of $14,409,719, respectively. The increase in current assets is a result of the closing of the Offering, whereby the Company issued 4,600,000 units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant and 690,000 over-allotment warrants. The units were sold at $4.30 per unit for gross proceeds of $19,786,900 ($19,780,000 from the sale of 4,600,000 units at $4.30 and $6,900 from the sale of 690,000 over-allotment warrants at $0.01). The warrants are exercisable immediately at $4.73/share and expire three (3) years from the issuance date. The decrease in current liabilities is the result of using some of the proceeds from the November 4 transaction to pay off all outstanding derivative liabilities. In addition, notes receivable increased to $176,851 as of December 31, 2021, as a result of the disposition of True Wireless.
Total assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $19,500,202 and $7,325,071, respectively. The increase in total assets is a result of the closing of the Offering. The units were sold at $4.30 per unit for gross proceeds of $19,786,900 ($19,780,000 from the sale of 4,600,000 units at $4.30 and $6,900 from the sale of 690,000 over-allotment warrants at $0.01). The warrants are exercisable immediately at $4.73/share and expire three (3) years from the issuance. Total assets increased by $12,175,131 from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021.

The operating lease right of use increased related to a new lease acquired in the ECS assets purchase agreement.
At December 31, 2021, our total liabilities of $15,948,881 decreased $2,102,156 from $18,051,037 at December 31, 2020. The proceeds from the closing of the Offering allowed the Company to repay all outstanding derivative liabilities.
At December 31, 2021, our total stockholders’ surplus was $3,551,321 as compared to a deficit of $10,725,966 at December 31, 2020. The principal reason for the increase in stockholders’ equity was the closing of the Offering.
We do not expect to incur net losses going forward and expect a positive cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2022 and for the entire year. Revenue streams are expecting to increase to cover the overall general and administrative expenses of the Company. We believe the ACP will continue to grow quarter over quarter in 2022. This revenue stream is expected deliver a positive net income as soon as the first quarter of 2022.
The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
As a result of increased financing activities in 2021, the cash increased in 2021 by $5,609,501.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had the following material commitments and contingencies.
Notes payable - related party - See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Notes payable and long-term debt - See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Convertible promissory notes - See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Related party transactions - See page to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash requirements and capital expenditures - At the current level of operations, the Company does not anticipate borrowing funds to meet basic operating costs. The Company may need to borrow funds to meet the hyper-growth expected to occur in the ACP in 2022.
Known trends and uncertainties - The Company is planning to acquire other businesses with similar business operations. The uncertainty of the economy may increase the difficulty of raising funds to support the planned business expansion.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has included a “going concern” explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect to continue to see increased revenues from the ACP that started in August of 2021 and we expect to show a positive net income in the coming months and throughout 2022 as our ACP related revenues increase. It is the expectation that the expansion could be the catalyst in the Company no longer having a “going concern” explanation in the notes to the unaudited financial statements the Company expect to file in one or more Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in calendar year 2022.
