ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” You should also carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
Overview
We were formed on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform developer under the name MassRoots, Inc. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from “MassRoots, Inc.” to “Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc.” We sold all of our social media assets on October 28, 2021 for cash consideration equal to $10,000 and discontinued all operations related to our social media business. On September 30, 2021, we closed our acquisition of Empire Services, Inc. (“Empire”), which operates 11 metal recycling facilities in Virginia and North Carolina. The acquisition was deemed effective October 1, 2021 on the effective date of the Certificate of Merger in Virginia.
Upon the acquisition of Empire, we transitioned into the scrap metal industry which involves collecting, classifying and processing appliances, construction material, end-of-life vehicles, boats, and industrial machinery. We process these items by crushing, shearing, shredding, separating, and sorting, into smaller pieces and categorize these recycled ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed metal pieces based on density and metal prior to sale. In cases of scrap cars, we remove the catalytic converters, aluminum wheels, and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to shredding the vehicle. We have designed our systems to maximize the value of metals produced from this process.
We operate an industrial shredder at our Kelford, North Carolina location. Our shredder is designed to produce a denser product and, in concert with advanced separation equipment, more refined recycled ferrous metals, which are more valuable as they require less processing to produce recycled steel products. In totality, this process reduces large metal objects like auto bodies into baseball-sizes pieces of shredded recycled metal.
The shredded pieces are then placed on a conveyor belt under magnetized drums to separate the ferrous metal from the mixed nonferrous metal and residue, producing consistent and high-quality ferrous scrap metal. The nonferrous metals and other materials then go through a number of additional mechanical systems which separate the nonferrous metal from any residue. The remaining nonferrous metal is further processed to sort the metal by type, grade, and quality prior to being sold as products, such as zorba (mainly aluminum), zurik (mainly stainless steel), and shredded insulated wire (mainly copper and aluminum).
One of our main corporate priorities is to open a facility with rail or deep-water port access to enable us to efficiently transport our products to domestic steel mills and overseas foundries. Because this would greatly expand the number of potential buyers of our processed scrap products, we believe opening a facility with port or rail access could result in an increase in both the revenue and profitability of our existing operations.
Empire is headquartered in Suffolk, Virginia and employs 89 people as of April 4, 2022.
Competitors
We compete with other metal recycling facility operators, such as Schnitzer Steel Industries, and are focused on utilizing technology to create operating efficiencies and competitive advantages over our peers.
Recent Developments and Other Sources of Funding
Financings
On February 16, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor for the sale of five (5) shares of our Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $100,000. The purchase and issuance of such shares of Series X Preferred Stock closed on February 18, 2021.
On February 22, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor for the sale of 1.25 shares of our Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $25,000. The purchase and issuance of such shares of Series X Preferred Stock closed on February 24, 2021.
On March 10, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor for the sale of 3.75 shares of our Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $75,000. The purchase and issuance of such shares of Series X Preferred Stock closed on March 12, 2021.
On November 30, 2021, we entered into securities purchase agreements with accredited investors for the placement of secured convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $37,714,966 together with warrants to purchase 2,514,332 shares of common stock. We paid $2,200,000 and a warrant to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock as commission for the offering. Our Chief Executive Officer rolled $4,762,838 of debt into the offering. Aggregate proceeds from the offering were $27,585,450.
COVID-19
We continue to proactively monitor and assess the COVID-19 global pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including but not limited to curtailing physical contact with customers). We further continue to monitor developments of the COVID-19 pandemic and we may take additional actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, patients, and business partners. We have implemented appropriate safety measures, following guidance from the Center for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments.

This increase was mainly attributed to the closing of our acquisition of Empire, which significantly expanded our operations, number of employees, and internal systems. There was an increase in payroll and related expenses of $1,237,923 as payroll and related expenses were $1,541,773 for 2021 as compared to $303,850 for the same period in 2020, which was the result of an increase in our labor force primarily due to the closing of the Empire acquisition. Advertising expense decreased by $25,366 to $33,595 for 2021 as compared to $58,961 for 2020 as the Company focused its resources on its scrap metal operations. Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased by $888,781 to $888,781 for 2021 from $0 in 2020 as a result of the Company acquiring fixed assets and intangible assets in the Empire acquisition. There were hauling and equipment maintenance costs of $513,928 in 2021, as compared to $0 in 2020, an increase of $513,928, due to the Company’s transportation and logistics costs increasing due to the Empire acquisition. Consulting, accounting, and legal expenses decreased to $395,901 during the year ended December 31, 2021 from $684,422 during the same period in 2020 a decrease of $288,521.

Our other general and administrative expenses increased to $1,789,698 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $107,857 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,681,841, as a result of the Company’s operations expanding from the Empire acquisition.
The increase of these expenditures resulted in our total operating expenses increasing to $5,787,118 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,165,892 during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,621,226.
Loss from Operations
Our loss from operations increased $1,767,353 to $2,927,564 during the year ended December 31, 2021, from $1,160,211 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other (Expense)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred other income of $1,295,143, as compared to $(13,550,249) for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $14,845,392. This increase is primarily due to a gain of the forgiveness of debt of $739,710 and $250,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There was a gain on settlement of convertible notes payable and accrued interest, warrants and accounts payable of $182,160,381 and $162,109,131 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company is party to senior secured convertible debt in the principal amount of $37,714,966 which matures on May 30, 2022 with an automatic extension until November 30, 2022 for an additional 6% original issuance discount. This senior secured debt is currently convertible into common shares at $15.00 per share and will automatically convert into shares of common stock should Greenwave’s shares of common stock be listed on a national exchange. Greenwave expects this debt will be converted into shares of common stock during fiscal year 2022; however, if the debt is not converted, the Company may have to raise additional capital to fulfill its obligations under these notes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the guidance on accounting for convertible debt instruments by removing the separation models for: (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature; and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, the Company will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature in such debt. Instead, we will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt, unless certain other conditions are met. We expect the elimination of these models will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for the Company’s convertible instruments falling under the scope of those models before the adoption of ASU 2020-06. Also, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The provisions of ASU 2020-06 are applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement” (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU 2018-13 removes certain disclosure requirements, including the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 also adds disclosure requirements, including changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. ASU 2018-13 became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, as if it had originated the contracts. Prior to this ASU, an acquirer generally recognizes contract assets acquired and contract liabilities assumed that arose from contracts with customers at fair value on the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendment (or if adopted early as of an interim period, as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application). We are still assessing this standard’s impact on our consolidated financial statements.
There are other various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and property and equipment valuation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill: Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested annually at December 31 for impairment. The annual qualitative or quantitative assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill exists. A qualitative assessment evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be recognized. The amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value then an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04-Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 requires goodwill impairments to be measured on the basis of the fair value of a reporting unit relative to the reporting unit’s carrying amount rather than on the basis of the implied amount of goodwill relative to the goodwill balance of the reporting unit. Thus, ASU 2017-04 permits an entity to record a goodwill impairment that is entirely or partly due to a decline in the fair value of other assets that, under existing GAAP, would not be impaired or have a reduced carrying amount. Furthermore, the ASU removes “the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.” Instead, all reporting units, even those with a zero or negative carrying amount will apply the same impairment test. Accordingly, the goodwill of reporting unit or entity with zero or negative carrying values will not be impaired, even when conditions underlying the reporting unit/entity may indicate that goodwill is impaired.
We test our goodwill for impairment annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. We are required to write down the value of goodwill only when our testing determines the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Our annual measurement date for testing goodwill impairment is December 31.
None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.
Intangible: Intangible assets with finite useful lives consist of tradenames, licenses and customer relationships and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to ten years. The estimated useful lives associated with finite-lived intangible assets are consistent with the estimated lives of the associated products and may be modified when circumstances warrant. Such assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $0 in impairment expense related to intangibles and $739,625 in amortization of intangible assets.
Beneficial Conversion Feature: The Company accounts for convertible notes payable in accordance with the guidelines established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, and EITF 00-27, Application of Issue No 98-5 To Certain Convertible Instruments. The Beneficial Conversion Feature (“BCF”) of a convertible note is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature of certain notes payable that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or in-the-money when issued. The Company records a BCF related to the issuance of a convertible note when issued and also records the estimated fair value of any warrants issued with those convertible notes. Beneficial conversion features that are contingent upon the occurrence of a future event are recorded when the contingency is resolved.
The BCF of a convertible note is measured by allocating a portion of the note’s proceeds to the warrants, if applicable, and as a reduction of the carrying amount of the convertible note equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature, both of which are credited to additional paid-in-capital. The value of the proceeds received from a convertible note is then allocated between the conversion features and warrants on an allocated fair value basis. The allocated fair value is recorded in the financial statements as a debt discount (premium) from the face amount of the note and such discount is amortized over the expected term of the convertible note (or to the conversion date of the note, if sooner) and is charged to interest expense using interest method.
Income Taxes: The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC 740, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates in effect in years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company also follows the guidance related to accounting for income tax uncertainties. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
Greenwave has also experienced impacts of inflation to its operations, mainly the significant increases in the prices of recycled metal, which in turn, has resulted in increases to the Company’s revenue and profit margin. The Company has also experienced increases to its wages and salaries, hauling, and towing expenses caused by inflation, but is taking steps to minimize impacts to the Company’s financial position. Greenwave does not experience material changes to its business due to seasonality.
