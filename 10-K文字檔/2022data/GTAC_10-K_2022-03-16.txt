.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K
includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “continue,” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other SEC filings.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated on February 9, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses or entities. We have not selected any Business Combination target and, prior to our Initial Public Offering on October 25, 2021 we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any Business Combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt.
The issuance of additional shares in a Business Combination:
•
may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the Initial Public Offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B Ordinary Shares resulted in the issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares on a greater than one-to-one
basis upon conversion of the Class B Ordinary Shares;
•
may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A Ordinary Shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A Ordinary Shares;
•
could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A Ordinary Shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
•
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;
•
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Units, Class A Ordinary Shares and/or warrants; and may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants
Similarly, if we issue debt or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in:
•
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
•
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
•
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;
•
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;
•
our inability to pay dividends on our Class A Ordinary Shares;
•
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A Ordinary Shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
•
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and
•
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,326,000 of cash and approximately $1,500,000 of working capital. We expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering and, subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying and completing a suitable Business Combination. Following the Initial Public Offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. For the periods from February 9, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021 we had losses from operations of approximately $291,000 associated with our organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering as well as, since October 25, 2021, efforts to identify a suitable Business Combination. Our expenses have increased substantially since the closing of the Initial Public Offering. More specifically, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for the costs for professional and consulting fees and travel associated with evaluating various Initial Business Combination candidates, as well as costs in connection with negotiating and executing a definitive agreement and related agreements and proxy materials. We have and expect to continue to generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents since the Initial Public Offering.
Loss from operations -
For the period from February 9, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately $291,000 consisting primarily of costs for being a public company of approximately $253,000 (including certain cost prior to the Initial Public Offering) and approximately $37,000 of costs associated with searching for a suitable Business Combination.
Other income -
In addition to operating costs, the Company had net other income of approximately $4,638,000 consisting of interest income of approximately $4,000, costs associated with issuance of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants and the change in fair value of the Company’s warrant liability of a reduction of approximately $5,125,000.
As discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements (and below), the Company accounts for its outstanding public and private warrants as components as derivative liabilities in the accompanying financial statements. As a result, the Company is required to measure the fair value of the public and private warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognize changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for each current period.
In addition, since we are organized as an exempt company in the Cayman Islands we are not subject to income tax in either the Cayman Islands or the United States.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of the Initial Public Offering through (i) $25,000 paid by our Sponsor to cover certain of our offering and formation costs in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares to our Sponsor and (ii) the receipt of loans to us of up to $300,000 by our Sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. As of February 10, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under the unsecured promissory note. Through closing of the Initial Public Offering on October 25, 2021 we borrowed an aggregate of $240,000 and upon closing of the Initial Public Offering, the entire balance of $240,000 was repaid.
The net proceeds from (i) the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $725,000, underwriting commissions of $4,000,000 including the commission on the underwriters’ over-allotment option exercise (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $7,000,000, including the deferred commission on the underwriters’ over-allotment option), and (ii) the sale of the Private Placement Warrants for a purchase price of $10,500,000 including the amount paid in connection with the underwriters’ over-allotment option exercise were approximately $205,775,000 including the underwriters’ over-allotment option exercise. Of this amount, $204,000,000 is held in the Trust Account, which includes the deferred underwriting commissions described above. The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The remaining $1,775,000 will not be held in the Trust Account.
We believe that we have sufficient working capital at December 31, 2021 to continue our operations for at least 15 months and likely longer.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest income (if any) to pay income taxes, if any. Since we are an exempt Cayman Island Company, we do not expect to pay income taxes in the Cayman Islands of in the United States. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, we will have available to us the initial $1,775,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account, as well as certain funds from loans from our Sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team. We will use these funds to primarily identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following
the Initial Public Offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial Business Combination, other than funds available from loans from our Sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth
due diligence and negotiating an initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor, its affiliates or our management team as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.
We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $300,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful Business Combinations; $260,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting obligations; $650,000 for office space, administrative and other support services; $500,000 for directors and officers insurance liability premiums; $55,000 for Nasdaq continued listing fees; and $135,000 for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. We have entered into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we pay our Sponsor or an affiliate thereof $10,000 per month (which is a portion of the amounts referenced in the immediately preceding sentence) for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team as well as the services to be provided by one or more investment professionals, creation and maintenance of our website, and miscellaneous additional services and other expenses and obligations of our Sponsor. Furthermore, we may enter into consulting arrangements directly or indirectly with individuals (who will not be our executive officers) to provide similar services.
These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed Business Combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific Business Combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.
Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial Business Combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. If we have not consummated our initial Business Combination within the required time period because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting estimates and policies:
Accounting estimates:
A critical accounting estimate to our financial statements is the estimated fair value of our warrant liability. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
•
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;
•
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
•
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
At inception of the warrants, October 25, 2021, the Company utilized an independent valuation consultant that used a binomial lattice model incorporating the Cox-Ross-Rubenstein
methodology to value the warrants. The estimated fair value of the warrant liability at October 25, 2021 was determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its shares based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield
curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero.
Since the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, at December 31, 2021, our Public Warrants were trading in an active market. As such, at December 31, 2021, the Company valued its Public Warrants based on publicly observable inputs (Level 1 inputs) from the trading in the Public Warrants in an active market ($0.54 per warrant on December 31, 2021). Since the Private Placement Warrants are substantially similar to the Public Warrants but do not trade, the Company valued them based on the value of the Public Warrants (significant other observable inputs - Level 2). The Company is required to record the warrants at fair value at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations.
The difference between the estimated fair value at October 25, 2021 ($0.79 per warrant or approximately $16,195,000) and the estimated fair value at December 31, 2021 ($0.54 per warrant or approximately $11,070,000) was $0.25 or approximately $5,125,000. For reference, each $0.10 change in fair value of our warrants translated to approximately $2,050,000.
Net Income or Loss per Ordinary Share:
The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Net income or loss per Ordinary Share is computed by dividing net income or loss applicable to Ordinary Share shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period plus, to the extent dilutive, the incremental number of Ordinary Shares to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury stock method.
The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Warrants”) and Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 20,500,000 Class A Ordinary Shares in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted income (loss) per Ordinary Share is the same as basic income (loss) per Ordinary Share for the period presented.
The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata among the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the respective period.
The following table reflects the net income per share after allocating income between the shares based on outstanding shares.
Financial Instruments:
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company complies with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured
and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial
assets and liabilities that are re-measured
and reported at fair value at least annually.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
•
our ability to complete our initial Business Combination;
•
our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial Business Combination;
•
our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial Business Combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements;
•
our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial Business Combination;
•
our pool of prospective target businesses;
•
the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities;
•
our public securities’ potential liquidity and trading;
•
the lack of a market for our securities;
•
the use of proceeds not held in the Trust Account or available to us from interest income on the Trust Account balance; or
•
our financial performance.
In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Offering Costs:
The Company complies with the requirements of the FASB ASC 340-10-S99-1
and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5A-“Expenses of Offering.” Costs incurred in connection with preparation for the Initial Public Offering were approximately $11,725,000 including approximately $725,000 of Company costs together with $11,000,000 of underwriters’ discount. Such costs have been allocated to equity instruments ($11,234,000) and warrant liability ($491,000), based on their relative values, and charged to equity or expense (in the case of the portion allocated to warrant liability) upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Company retained an independent financial advisor in connection with the Initial Public Offering of the Company’s Ordinary Shares and paid an agreed amount of $175,000 that was included in offering costs, net of full reimbursement by the underwriters.
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption:
All of the 20,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares sold on October 25, 2021 as part of a Unit in the Initial Public Offering discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of Ordinary Shares under the Company’s liquidation or tender offer/stockholder approval provisions. In
accordance with FASB ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the security to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of FASB ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, its articles of association provide that in no event will it redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (tangible assets less intangible assets and liabilities) to be less than $5,000,001. However, because all of the Class A Ordinary Shares are redeemable, all of the shares are recorded as Class A Ordinary Shares subject to redemption on the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company recognizes changes immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the securities at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares are affected by adjustments to additional paid-in
capital. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, 20,000,000 of the 20,000,000 Public Shares were classified outside of permanent equity. Class A Ordinary Shares subject to redemption consist of:
Derivative Financial Instruments:
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value upon issuance, and the liability is then re-valued
at each reporting date, as determined by the Company based upon a valuation report obtained from its independent third-party valuation firm, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current
based on whether or not net-cash
settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The Company’s warrant liability is a derivative financial instrument, see Note 5 to the financial statements.
