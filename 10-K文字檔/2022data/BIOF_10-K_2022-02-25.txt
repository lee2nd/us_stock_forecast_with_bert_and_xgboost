Business Overview
Blue Biofuels, Inc (the “Company”) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy, biofuels, and bioplastics technologies sectors.
In early 2018, our chief executive officer (“CEO”) Ben Slager invented a new technology system referred to as Cellulose-to-Sugar or CTS 2.0, and the Company filed, and recently received, a patent application for this technology. The CTS 2.0 process is a continuous mechanical/chemical dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar and lignin.
The CTS 2.0 system converts plant-based feedstock into two product streams, soluble sugars and lignin, each of which can be converted into multiple products: (1) sugars can be further processed into cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels like jet fuel, and potentially into bio chemicals; and (2) Lignin can be used in ion exchange resins, specialty chemicals, or to create bioplastics. Lignin can also be burned as a renewable fuel.
The Company expects to have its 5th generation CTS 2.0 prototype, along with auxiliary equipment, completed in 2022. The goal of the 5th generation system is to prove larger volume production, and to be an intermediate step to the final 6th generation which is intended to be a commercial volume system.
Plan of Operation
The Company’s strategy is to diversify its product portfolio to include a number of product lines. These potentially include (1) biofuels - such as ethanol, or converting ethanol into higher biofuels like jet-fuel and the like; (2) selling sulfur-free lignin to ion exchange resin producers; (3) making bioplastics from lignin; or, (4) using the sugars and lignin to make biochemicals. We believe that one or more of these co-products could potentially be profitable for the Company.
Our goal is to develop our CTS 2.0 technology to a commercial scale and then seek to either enter into a joint venture or acquire existing corn ethanol plants to install the CTS 2.0 technology. The Company is also looking into converting ethanol to jet fuel. To minimize dilution to shareholders, we will seek project-based financing to build (or acquire and retrofit) or joint venture with existing ethanol producers to produce cellulosic ethanol and lignin/bioplastics and other specialty chemicals from our CTS 2.0 system. We believe retrofitting existing plants with the CTS 2.0 technology may achieve more rapid commercialization than building new plants. If its first plant is profitable, the Company intends to grow with additional plants in the United States and explore international growth by either licensing the technology or forming joint ventures with foreign domestic partners to build plants ourselves.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included the Renewable Fuel Standard Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), mandates a certain amount of renewable fuel be blended into the transportation fuel used by all vehicles in the country. This Program provides monetary incentives to companies that produce renewable transportation fuel, and establishes Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) or credits for each gallon of renewable transportation fuel produced in the United States, and breaks down those fuels into different D-codes depending on the source of the renewable fuel. D3 is the code for renewable ethanol that comes from cellulosic materials. (D6 is for corn ethanol). The value of the D3 RIN fluctuates, but as of this filing, it is approximately $3.40 per gallon of ethanol. To profit from these incentives, the Company plans to apply for these D3 RIN credits as it brings its first plant into commercial operation.
The Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization. As of this date, the Company has generated $194,319 in revenue, however it has not generated any revenues from its core business.
Capital Formation
From January 1, 2021 through the date of filing, 13,455,008 warrants were exercised for proceeds of $1,302,817.
From January 1, 2021, through the date of filing, the Company issued 10,543,332 shares at prices ranging from $0.075 to $0.25 per share for proceeds of $2,260,750.
From January 1, 2021, through the date of filing, 500,000 options were exercised for proceeds of $20,400.
From January 1, 2021 through the date of filing, the Company issued an aggregate of 515,700 shares of its common stock for services valued at $120,152.
From January 1, 2021 through the date of filing, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,166,667 warrants for services. Using a Black-Scholes asset-pricing model, these warrants were valued at $72,090. These warrant have all been exercised.
From January 1, 2021 through the date of filing, the company issued 7,080,000 shares in exchange for convertible debt of $279,000.
Purchases of Equity Securities
The Company has never purchased, nor does it own, any equity securities of any other issuer.
Going Concern
The Company has incurred losses since inception, and although it currently has a working capital surplus, it may be unable to raise further capital. At December 31, 2021 the Company had a working capital surplus of $713,554 and had incurred accumulated losses of $48,821,403 since its inception. The Company expects to incur significant additional losses in connection with its continued start-up activities. As disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and its need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to pay its operating expenses.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $0 in revenue and also $0 in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s general and administrative expenses decreased by $192,826 to $1,034,948 from $1,227,776 in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to non-cash options packages valued at $876,291 in 2020 as compared to $31,104 non-cash stock compensation in 2021, partially offset by increased salaries to $942,522 from $396,394 in 2020.
Interest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2021 by $156,420 to $33,772 from $190,192 in 2020. This decrease is due to the Company’s decision to accrue interest on the back pay due to management in 2020 followed by the repayment of most back pay in 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received a loan forgiveness of $66,330 versus $0 in 2020.
Research and Development
The Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the amounts charged to research and development expenses were $1,103,436 and $763,159, respectively.
The increase is due to the Company hiring additional laboratory personnel after successfully raising additional capital.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2021 the Company had $1,164,664 in cash and total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was negative $1,396,046. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $286,579 in cash and total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was negative $3,336,764. Total debt, including advances, accounts payable and other notes payable at December 31, 2021, together with interest payable thereon and contingent liabilities, was $3,234,293, a decrease of $994,973 from December 31, 2020, where it stood at $4,229,266. This decrease is primarily attributable to paying down back pay and $279,000 of convertible notes having converted. $2,738,132 of the remaining debt was renegotiated to be payable out of future revenue or future profits and otherwise does not come due.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s operating expenses increased $180,933 to $2,171,868 from $1,990,935 in 2020. This increase can primarily be attributed to an increase in salaries.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s investing activities used $233,132 in cash. This can be attributed to $216,390 used to purchase machinery and equipment, and $16,742 in patent expenses.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated an aggregate of $3,576,467 through its financing activities, which is an increase of $2,272,757 from $1,303,710 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. This increase from the prior year can be attributed to $2,260,750 raised in private placements as compared to $887,380 in 2020, and $1,315,717 received from the exercise of warrants as compared to $350,000 in 2020.
Capital Resources
At this time, the Company has limited liquidity and capital resources. To continue funding its operations, the Company will need to generate revenue or obtain additional financing for current and future operations. The Company anticipates needing around $7.5 to $10 million to optimize and scale up its CTS 2.0 system to be commercially ready. The Company anticipates reaching this stage in around 12-18 months. There is no guarantee that we will achieve all of the additional funding that is needed.
As of the date of filing, the Company has raised $7,500 through the exercise of warrants in 2022, $3,576,467 in 2021, through the issuance of common stock and the exercise of warrants and options, in addition to $10,692,293 raised through the end of 2020 through its private placement offerings, and in addition to capital raised through debt or convertible notes. However, there is no guarantee that the company will be able to raise any additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company.
The inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to re-evaluate and revise its operations.
Equity
As of December 31, 2021, shareholders’ equity was negative $(1,396,046).
There were 274,003,883 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
There were no preferred shares outstanding.
The Company has paid no dividends.
