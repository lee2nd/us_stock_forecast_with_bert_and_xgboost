Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Acquisition of Meredith:
On December 1, 2021, Dotdash Media Inc. (formerly known as About Inc., "Dotdash"), a wholly owned subsidiary of IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC"), completed the acquisition of Meredith Holdings Corporation ("Meredith"), which holds Meredith Corporation's national media business, which is comprised of its digital and magazine businesses, and its corporate operations. The parent of the combined entity is Dotdash Meredith, Inc. ("Dotdash Meredith").
Vimeo Spin-off:
On May 25, 2021, IAC completed the spin-off of its full stake in Vimeo to IAC shareholders (which we refer to as the “Spin-off”). Following the Spin-off, Vimeo, Inc. (formerly Vimeo Holdings, Inc. ("Vimeo")) became an independent, separately traded public company. Therefore, Vimeo is presented as a discontinued operation within IAC's financial statements for all periods prior to May 25, 2021.
MTCH Separation:
On December 19, 2019, IAC/InterActiveCorp ("Old IAC") entered into a Transaction Agreement (as amended, the "Transaction Agreement") with Match Group, Inc. ("Old MTCH"), IAC Holdings, Inc. ("New IAC" or the "Company"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Old IAC, and Valentine Merger Sub LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Old IAC. On June 30, 2020, the businesses of Old MTCH were separated from the remaining businesses of Old IAC through a series of transactions that resulted in the pre-transaction stockholders of Old IAC owning shares in two, separate public companies-(1) Old IAC, which was renamed Match Group, Inc. ("New Match") and which owns the businesses of Old MTCH and certain Old IAC financing subsidiaries, and (2) New IAC, which was renamed IAC/InterActiveCorp, and which owns Old IAC's other businesses-and the pre-transaction stockholders of Old MTCH (other than Old IAC) owning shares in New Match. This transaction is referred to as the "MTCH Separation."

As used herein, "IAC," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" and similar terms refer to IAC/InterActiveCorp and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
For a more detailed description of the Company's operating businesses, see "Description of IAC Businesses" included in "Item 1 - Business."
Sources of Revenue
Dotdash Meredith revenue consists of digital and print revenue. Digital revenue consists principally of display advertising, performance marketing, and licensing and other revenue. Print revenue consists principally of subscription, newsstand, print advertising, and performance marketing revenue.
Display advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly by Dotdash Meredith's sales team and through programmatic advertising networks. Performance marketing revenue includes commissions generated through affiliate commerce, affinity marketing, and performance marketing channels. Affiliate commerce and performance marketing commission revenue is generated when Dotdash Meredith refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction, or generated on a cost-per-click, cost-per-lead, or some other cost-per-action basis. Affinity marketing programs partner with third parties to market and place magazine subscriptions online for both Dotdash Meredith and third-party publisher titles where Dotdash Meredith acts as an agent. Commissions are earned when a subscriber name has been provided to the publisher and any free trial period is completed. Licensing and other revenue primarily includes revenue generated through brand and content licensing agreements. Brand licensing generates royalties from multiple long-term trademark licensing agreements with retailers, manufacturers, publishers, and service providers.
Print subscription revenue is derived from the sale of magazines and books to consumers. Most of Dotdash Meredith's subscription sales are prepaid at the time of order and may be canceled at any time for a refund of the pro rata portion of the initial subscription. Newsstand revenue is related to single copy magazines or bundles of single copy magazines to wholesalers for resale on newsstands. Publications sold to magazine wholesalers are sold with the right to receive credit from Dotdash Meredith for magazines returned to the wholesaler by retailers. Print advertising revenue relates to the sale of advertising in magazines directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies, which is recognized when the magazine issue is published, which is the issue’s on-sale date.
Angi Ads and Leads Revenue is primarily derived from (i) advertising revenue, which includes revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising, (ii) consumer connection revenue, which is comprised of fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service), and (iii) membership subscription revenue from service professionals and consumers. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered, and geographic location of service. Angi Services revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from jobs (i) sourced through the “Book Now” feature, which lets consumers complete booking the entire transaction digitally for work that is completed physically, (ii) under managed projects (including Angi Roofing), which are home improvement projects, and (iii) through retail partnerships for installation of furniture or other household items.
The Search segment consists of Ask Media Group and the Desktop business. Ask Media Group and Desktop revenue consist principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. The majority of the paid listings displayed are supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") pursuant to our services agreement with Google, described below under "Services Agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement")." Ask Media Group also earns revenue from display advertisements (sold directly and through programmatic advertising networks). Desktop revenue also includes fees paid by subscribers for downloadable desktop applications, as well as display advertisements.
Included in the Emerging & Other segment are Care.com and Mosaic Group. Care.com generates revenue through subscription fees from families and caregivers to its suite of products and services, as well as through annual contracts with corporate employers who provide access to Care.com’s suite of products and services as an employee benefit and through contracts with businesses that recruit employees through its platform. Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees paid by subscribers for downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and directly to consumers, as well as display advertisements. Revenue for the remaining businesses within the Emerging & Other segment is generated primarily through marketplace services, advertising, media production and distribution, and subscriptions.
Services Agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement")
A meaningful portion of the Company's revenue (and a substantial portion of IAC’s net cash from operating activities attributable to continuing operations that it can freely access) is attributable to the Services Agreement. In addition, the Company earns certain other advertising revenue from Google that is not attributable to the Services Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, total revenue earned from Google was $755.1 million, $556.1 million and $732.1 million, respectively, representing 20%, 20%, and 29%, respectively, of the Company's revenue. The related accounts receivable totaled $89.1 million and $61.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The total revenue earned from the Services Agreement for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $661.3 million, $498.3 million and $677.0 million, respectively, representing 18%, 18% and 27%, respectively, of the Company's revenue.
The revenue attributable to the Services Agreement is earned by Ask Media Group and the Desktop business, both within the Search segment. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue earned from the Services Agreement was $542.1 million, $344.8 million and $385.9 million, respectively, within Ask Media Group, and $119.1 million, $153.5 million and $291.1 million, respectively, within the Desktop business.
Effective August 1, 2021, the Company and Google amended the Services Agreement to extend the expiration date from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024 and to provide for an automatic renewal for an additional one year period absent a notice of non-renewal from either party on or before March 31, 2023. The Company believes that the amended agreement, taken as a whole, is comparable to its previously existing agreement with Google. The Services Agreement requires that the Company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google. Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. These updates may be specific to the Services Agreement or could be more general and thereby impact the Company as well as other companies. These policy and guideline updates have in the past and could in the future require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which have been and could be costly to address or negatively impact revenue and have had and in the future could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As described below, Google has made changes to the policies under the Services Agreement and has also made industry-wide changes that have negatively impacted the Desktop business-to-consumer ("B2C") business and it may do so in the future.
Certain industry-wide policy changes became effective on July 1, 2019 and August 27, 2020. These industry-wide changes, combined with increased enforcement of policies under the Services Agreement have had a negative impact on the results of operations of the B2C business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reassessed the fair values of the Desktop reporting unit and the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $265.1 million and $32.2 million, respectively. The reduction in the Company’s fair value estimates was due to lower consumer queries, increasing challenges in monetization and the reduced ability to market profitably due to policy changes implemented by Google and other browsers. The effects of COVID-19 on monetization were an additional factor.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, Google suspended services with respect to some B2C's products and may do so with respect to other products in the future. As a result, the B2C business elected to modify certain marketing strategies in early January 2021. Subsequently, Google informed us of another policy change in the first quarter of 2021 that became effective on May 10, 2021. We anticipated that this Google policy change would eliminate our ability to successfully introduce and market new B2C products that would be profitable. Therefore, we undertook cost reduction measures and effectively eliminated all marketing of B2C products beginning in March 2021. This elimination of marketing has positively impacted profitability in 2021 because revenue from B2C products is earned over multiple periods beyond just the period in which the initial marketing is incurred. Following the cessation of the introduction of new products in March 2021, the B2C revenue stream relates solely to the then existing installed base of products. For the year ended December 31, 2021, B2C revenue declined by $55.5 million to $77.7 million, while Desktop operating income, excluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2020, increased by $32.5 million to $49.7 million, versus the year ended December 31, 2020. Beyond 2021, we expect the revenue and profits of the B2C business and Desktop, respectively, to decline significantly.
Angi Inc.'s Brand Integration Initiative
In March 2021, ANGI Homeservices Inc. changed its name to Angi Inc. and updated one of its leading websites and brands, Angie’s List, to Angi, and since then, has concentrated its marketing investment in the Angi brand in order to focus its marketing, sales, and branding efforts on a single brand.
Angi Inc. relies heavily on free, or organic, search results from search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing to drive traffic to its websites. This brand integration initiative has adversely affected the placement and ranking of Angi Inc. websites, particularly Angi.com, in organic search results as Angi does not have the same domain history as Angie’s List. In addition, Angi Inc. shifted marketing to support Angi, away from HomeAdvisor, which has negatively affected the efficiency of its search engine marketing efforts.
Since the beginning of the integration process, these efforts have had a pronounced negative impact on service requests from organic search results and via Angi Inc.'s mobile applications, which in turn has resulted in increased paid search engine marketing to generate service requests. These factors have increased marketing spend and reduced revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, materially more than expected at the launch of the brand initiative in March 2021. Angi Inc. expects the pronounced negative impact to organic search results, increased paid search engine marketing costs, and reduced monetization from our mobile applications to continue until such time as the new brand establishes search engine optimization ranking and consumer awareness is established.
Angi Services Investment
Angi Services was launched in August 2019 and Angi Inc. has invested significantly in Angi Services and expects to continue to do so going forward. Angi Inc. expects significant future revenue growth at Angi Services as it expands the business, refines the overall experience, and increases penetration in certain geographies and service categories. This increased investment in Angi Services has contributed to losses for Angi Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021 and this investment is expected to continue through at least 2023.
Dotdash Meredith Print Publications
In February 2022, the Company announced its plans to discontinue certain print publications, consisting of Entertainment Weekly, InStyle, EatingWell, Health, Parents, and People en Español, with the April 2022 issues of these publications being their final print editions. Dotdash Meredith plans on investing in its remaining print magazines, which include PEOPLE, Better Homes & Gardens, and Southern Living, by among other things enhancing paper quality and trim sizes.
Dotdash Meredith Digital Content Investment
Dotdash Meredith plans to invest $80 million in 2022 in digital content across all brands.
Distribution, Marketing and Advertiser Relationships
We pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments made to partners who direct traffic to our Ask Media Group websites, who distribute our business-to-business customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites, and fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. We also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as Google and other search engines and social media websites such as Facebook. With the acquisition of Meredith we also pay subscription acquisition costs, which represent commission payments to third-party agents to sell magazine subscriptions within our print business. In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. These distribution channels might also offer their own services and products, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
We market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
COVID-19 Update
The impact on the Company from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to contain its spread has been varied and volatile.
As previously disclosed, the impact of COVID-19 on the businesses in IAC's Angi Inc. segment initially resulted in a decline in demand for service requests, driven primarily by decreases in demand in certain categories of jobs (particularly discretionary indoor projects). While these businesses experienced a rebound in service requests in the second half of 2020 and through early 2021, service requests started to decline in May 2021 compared to the comparable months of 2020 as a result of the surge in 2020 and due to impacts of the Angi Inc.'s Brand Integration Initiative described above. Moreover, many service professionals' businesses have been adversely impacted by labor and material constraints and many service professionals have and continue to have limited capacity to take on new business, which continues to negatively impact the ability of these businesses to monetize the slightly increased level of service requests. Although Angi Inc.'s ability to monetize service requests rebounded modestly in the second half of 2021, it still has not returned to levels it experienced pre-COVID-19. No assurances can be provided that Angi Inc. will continue to be able to improve monetization, or that service professionals' businesses and, as a consequence, its revenue and profitability will not continue to be adversely impacted in the future. The Search segment has experienced an increase in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year due, in part, to lower advertising rates in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.
The volatile nature of our operating results in 2020 due to COVID-19 will impact the comparability of our year-over-year results of operations.
In the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company determined that the effects of COVID-19 were an indicator of possible impairment for certain of its assets and identified the following impairments:
•a $212.0 million impairment related to the goodwill of the Desktop reporting unit (included in the Search segment);
•a $21.4 million impairment related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Desktop reporting unit;
•a $51.5 million impairment of certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values; and
•a $7.5 million impairment of a note receivable and a warrant related to certain investees.
In the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded impairments of $53.2 million and $10.8 million related to the goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, of the Desktop reporting unit. These impairments were due in part to the effects of COVID-19 on monetization. Refer to "Services Agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement")" for additional information.
The extent to which developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and measures designed to curb its spread continue to impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including the continuing spread of COVID-19, the severity of resurgences of COVID-19 caused by variant strains of the virus, the effectiveness of vaccines and attitudes toward receiving them, materials and supply chain constraints, labor shortages, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel, discretionary services and other activity, and public reactions to these developments.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." For a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the annual audited consolidated and combined financial statements of the Company and notes thereto filed on the Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities Exchange Commission on June 1, 2021.
Revenue
________________________
N/A = Not applicable
•Dotdash Meredith revenue increased 113% to $456.3 million due to the contribution of $169.9 million from Meredith, acquired December 1, 2021, growth from Dotdash of $44.5 million, or 32%, in Display Advertising Revenue and $28.1 million, or 37%, higher Performance Marketing Revenue. The growth in Dotdash Display Advertising Revenue was driven by an increase in advertising sold at higher rates in 2021 through its direct sales and programmatic channels as the prior year rates were negatively impacted by COVID-19. The increase in Dotdash Performance Marketing Revenue was due primarily to growth in both affiliate commerce commission revenue and performance marketing commission revenue due to increased online sales and new performance marketing products.
•Angi Inc. revenue increased 15% to $1.7 billion driven by increases of $195.4 million, or 120%, in Angi Services Revenue, $11.7 million, or 1%, in Angi Ads and Leads Revenue and $10.4 million, or 14%, at the European businesses. The increase in Angi Services Revenue is due primarily to organic growth and, to a lesser extent, from Angi Roofing, acquired July 1, 2021. The increase in Angi Ads and Leads Revenue is due primarily to an increase in advertising revenue of $25.5 million or 11%. The revenue increase at the European businesses was due to strong growth across all of its markets due to increased consumer demand and the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British Pound.
•Search revenue increased 42% to $873.3 million due to growth of $301.0 million, or 70%, from Ask Media Group, partially offset by a decrease of $40.9 million, or 23%, from Desktop. The increase in Ask Media Group revenue was due to higher and more efficient marketing driving increased visitors to ad supported search and content websites and an increase in advertising rates in 2021 as the prior year rates were negatively impacted by COVID-19. The decrease in Desktop revenue was due primarily to the Google policy changes announced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 described above under "Services Agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement")."
•Emerging & Other revenue increased 46% to $685.2 million due primarily to the contribution and growth of Care.com, acquired February 11, 2020, the addition of Lifecare, acquired by Care.com in October 2020, and increased revenue from IAC Films, Bluecrew, Vivian Health, and The Daily Beast.
Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation shown separately below)
Cost of revenue in 2021 increased from 2020 due to increases of $255.8 million from Search, $152.6 million from Angi Inc., $94.1 million from Dotdash Meredith, and $53.8 million from Emerging & Other.
•The Search increase was primarily due to an increase of $240.9 million in traffic acquisition costs at Ask Media Group resulting from the increase in revenue.
•The Angi Inc. increase was due primarily to organic growth from Angi Services resulting in increased payments to third-party professional service providers and $51.2 million of costs attributable to the inclusion of Angi Roofing, primarily for roofing materials and third-party contractors.
•The Dotdash Meredith increase was due primarily to $63.6 million of expense from the inclusion of Meredith, and increases of $17.4 million in compensation expense related to increased headcount and $7.0 million in third-party content creation costs. The increased investment in content creation costs is due primarily to contractors working on projects related to content updates and improvements, video content production, and writer and expert fees.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to $22.1 million in payments made to workers staffed by Bluecrew resulting from an increase in revenue, $16.2 million of expense from the inclusion of Lifecare, and $13.5 million and $8.8 million in production costs and participation payments, respectively, at IAC Films due to recent theatrical releases, partially offset by a decrease of $12.7 million at Care.com related to a change from gross to net revenue recognition for certain Care For Business contracts.
Selling and marketing expense
Selling and marketing expense in 2021 increased from 2020 due to increases of $121.1 million from Angi Inc., $65.7 million from Dotdash Meredith, and $54.7 million from Emerging & Other, partially offset by a decrease of $44.2 million from Search.
•The Angi Inc. increase was due primarily to increases in advertising expense of $66.2 million and compensation expense of $33.2 million, expense of $14.0 million from the inclusion of Angi Roofing, and an increase in consulting costs of $12.2 million. The increase in advertising expense was due primarily to increases of $58.5 million in online marketing and $6.9 million in television spend. The increase in online marketing spend is attributable to the brand integration initiative described above under "Angi Inc.'s Brand Integration Initiative." The increase in television spend in 2021 reflects the return to historical spending levels as compared to the cost cutting initiatives during 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as continued efforts related to the brand integration initiative. The increase in compensation expense was due primarily to increased commission expense and an increase in sales force headcount, partially offset by lower compensation expense in France due to headcount reductions in 2020. The increase in consulting costs was due primarily to various sales initiatives at Angi Services.
•The Dotdash Meredith increase was due primarily to $45.8 million of expense from the inclusion of Meredith, and increases in online advertising expense of $11.4 million and compensation expense of $6.3 million. The increase in online advertising expense is due primarily to an increase relative to depressed levels in 2020 due to COVID-19. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to higher headcount.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to increases of $26.7 million in online marketing and television spend at Care.com, $7.3 million in television spend at Mosaic, $4.8 million in expense from the inclusion of Lifecare, and increases of $4.2 million and $2.3 million in compensation expense at Care.com and Vivian Health, respectively, each due primarily to higher headcount. The increase in online marketing and television spend at Care.com is due primarily to efforts to increase its customer base.
•The Search decrease was due primarily to a decrease in marketing of $73.7 million at Desktop as it substantially reduced marketing of its B2C products in January 2021 and the subsequent elimination of all marketing of its B2C products beginning in early March 2021 due primarily to the Google policy changes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 described above under "Services Agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement")," partially offset by an increase of $28.3 million in online marketing at Ask Media Group.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense in 2021 increased from 2020 due to increases of $102.4 million from Dotdash Meredith, $33.1 million from Emerging & Other, and $31.7 million from Angi Inc., partially offset by decreases of $108.0 million from Corporate and $7.0 million from Search.
•The Dotdash Meredith increase was due primarily to $75.0 million of expense from the inclusion of Meredith and $25.2 million in transaction-related costs at Dotdash related to the Meredith transaction. Included in Meredith's expense is $53.3 million in transaction-related costs associated with its acquisition, including charges related to double-trigger change in control payments.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to a change of $21.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (expense of $15.0 million in 2021 compared to income of $6.9 million in 2020) due to the amount of contingent consideration to be paid out in connection with a previous Mosaic Group acquisition, $11.4 million of expense from the inclusion of Lifecare, and an increase of $7.8 million in compensation expense at Care.com due primarily to an increase in headcount, partially offset by a decrease of $7.1 million in compensation expense at Mosaic Group.
•The Angi Inc. increase was due primarily to an increase of $27.7 million in professional fees, $10.8 million of expense from the inclusion of Angi Roofing, $9.6 million in one-time costs related to Angi Inc. reducing its real estate footprint in 2021, increases of $8.4 million in the provision for credit losses, and $7.2 million in software and maintenance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $37.9 million in compensation expense. The increase in professional fees was due primarily to an increase in outsourced personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, legal fees, consulting costs, and recruiting fees. The increase in outsourced personnel costs is due primarily to an increase in call volume related to Angi Inc.'s customer service function. The real estate related costs are the result of impairments of right-of-use lease assets, leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment associated with office space Angi Inc. vacated. The increase in the provision for credit losses is primarily due to higher Angi Services revenue as the provision for credit losses as a percentage of revenue has remained relatively flat. The increase in software licenses and maintenance costs is due to increased investment in software to support Angi Inc.'s customer service function. The decrease in compensation expense was due primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $54.6 million and severance costs recorded in the European business in 2020 associated with headcount reductions in France, partially offset by $15.6 million in wage related expenses resulting primarily from wage increases and $7.0 million in charges related to the acquisition of the remaining interests in MyBuilder at a premium to fair value. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to $30.8 million in stock appreciation rights expense recognized in 2020 which was not incurred in 2021 as the awards became fully vested in 2020 and a net decrease of $7.7 million due to the reversal of previously recognized expense related to unvested awards that were forfeited due to management departures in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since 2020.
•The Corporate decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $56.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, a $25.0 million contribution to the IAC Fellows endowment included in the prior year period, a decrease in transaction-related costs ($19.7 million and $2.2 million related to the MTCH Separation and the Spin-off, respectively, in 2020 compared to $6.2 million in connection with the Spin-off in 2021) and the prior year period reflecting higher employer payroll taxes related to Match Group stock option exercises by IAC employees. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense is due primarily to the inclusion in 2020 of $54.8 million in modification charges related to the MTCH Separation and the forfeiture of certain equity awards in 2021, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since 2020.
•The Search decrease was due primarily to decreases of $5.8 million in compensation expense and $2.2 million in lease expense at Desktop. The decrease in compensation expense is primarily due to a reduction in headcount and the decrease in lease expense is primarily due to the early termination of a lease agreement in 2020.
Product development expense
Product development expense in 2021 increased from 2020 due to increases of $24.7 million from Emerging & Other and $14.3 million from Dotdash Meredith.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to increases of $8.4 million and $5.9 million in compensation expense and outsourced personnel costs, respectively, at Care.com, $4.5 million in expense from the inclusion of Lifecare, and $1.8 million in compensation expense at Vivian Health. The increase in compensation expense at both Care.com and Vivian Health is primarily due to increases in headcount. The increase in outsourced personnel costs at Care.com is primarily due to enhancing existing product offerings and developing new products.
•The Dotdash Meredith increase was due primarily to $7.9 million of expense from the inclusion of Meredith and an increase of $5.3 million in compensation expense. The increase in compensation expense is due to higher headcount to aid in new and enhanced user experiences on its websites.
Depreciation
Depreciation in 2021 increased from 2020 due primarily to the investments in Angi Inc.'s capitalized software and $3.9 million of expense from the inclusion of Meredith, partially offset by the inclusion in 2020 of write-offs of leasehold improvements as a result of early lease terminations at Desktop and Mosaic Group.
Operating income (loss)
________________________
NM = Not meaningful.
Operating loss decreased $400.6 million to a loss of $137.1 million due primarily to the inclusion in 2020 of a goodwill impairment of $265.1 million and $32.2 million in indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments at Search related to the Desktop business, a decrease of $109.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, a decrease of $19.8 million in amortization of intangibles, excluding the $32.2 million Desktop impairment noted above, and an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million described below, partially offset by a change of $21.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (expense of $15.0 million in 2021 compared to income of $6.9 million in 2020) and an increase of $6.2 million in depreciation. The goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments in 2020 at the Desktop business were primarily due to lower consumer queries, increasing challenges in monetization and the reduced ability to market profitably due to browser policy changes implemented by Google and other browsers. The effects of COVID-19 on monetization were an additional factor. The remaining decrease in amortization of intangibles of $19.8 million was due principally to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during 2020, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to the acquisitions of Meredith and Lifecare. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the inclusion in 2020 of $55.7 million in modification charges related to the MTCH Separation, the forfeiture of certain equity awards in 2021 and stock appreciation rights expense recognized in 2020, which was not incurred in 2021, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since 2020. The increase in depreciation was due primarily to the investments in Angi Inc. capitalized software and expense from the inclusion of Meredith.
See "Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a detailed description of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments.
The aggregate carrying value of goodwill for which the most recent estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value is less than 20% is approximately $243.0 million. There are no indefinite-lived intangible assets for which the most recent estimate of the excess fair value over carrying value is less than 20%.
At December 31, 2021, there was $365.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 5.1 years.
Adjusted EBITDA
For a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see "Principles of Financial Reporting." For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see "Note 13-Segment Information" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
•Dotdash Meredith Adjusted EBITDA decreased 49% to $33.6 million, despite higher revenue, due primarily to $25.2 million in transaction-related costs in connection with the Meredith transaction, increases in compensation expense, advertising expense, and third-party content creation costs, and losses from Meredith due primarily to $53.3 million in transaction-related costs associated with its acquisition, including charges related to double-trigger change in control payments.
•Angi Inc. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 84% to $27.9 million, despite higher revenue, due primarily to increases in cost of revenue due primarily to the growth of Angi Services, including $51.2 million of costs attributable to the inclusion of Angi Roofing, advertising expense attributable to the brand integration initiative described above under "Angi Inc.'s Brand Integration Initiative," compensation expense due to increased commission expense and headcount, $9.6 million in one-time costs as a result of Angi Inc. reducing its real estate footprint, and $7.0 million in charges related to the acquisition of the remaining interests in MyBuilder at a premium to fair value.
•Search Adjusted EBITDA increased 111% to $108.4 million due to an increase in Ask Media Group revenue and the decrease of $73.7 million in marketing at Desktop as it substantially reduced marketing of its B2C products in January 2021 and the subsequent elimination of all marketing of B2C products beginning in early March 2021 as a result of Google policy changes.
•Emerging & Other Adjusted EBITDA increased $71.1 million to $33.4 million from a loss of $37.7 million due primarily to increased profits at Care.com as 2020 included $34.0 million in transaction-related items from its acquisition (including $17.3 million in deferred revenue write-offs and $16.7 million in transaction-related costs), and profits in the current year compared to losses in the prior year at IAC Films.
•Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased 35% to $96.0 million due primarily to the inclusion in 2020 of the $25.0 million contribution to the IAC Fellows endowment, a decrease in transaction-related costs ($19.7 million and $2.2 million related to the MTCH Separation and the Spin-off, respectively, in 2020 compared to $6.2 million in connection with the Spin-off in 2021), and the prior year period reflecting higher employer payroll taxes related to Match Group stock option exercises by IAC employees.
Interest expense
Interest expense in 2021 increased from 2020 due primarily to the issuance of the ANGI Group Senior Notes in August 2020, the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the termination of the ANGI Group Revolving Facility in August 2021, the borrowings of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans and commitment fees relating to the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility in December 2021, and the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the termination of a bridge facility entered into by IAC in connection with the Meredith transaction, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of the ANGI Group Term Loan during the second quarter of 2021 and the inclusion in 2020 of the write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the termination of the IAC Group Credit Facility in October 2020. Interest expense was further impacted by a decrease in interest expense on the ANGI Group Term Loan due to lower interest rates and the decrease in the average outstanding balance compared to the prior year period.
Unrealized gain on investment in MGM Resorts International
The Company recognized unrealized gains of $789.3 million and $840.5 million on its investment in MGM during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company purchased a total of 59.0 million shares of MGM.
Other income (expense), net
_____________________
(a) Includes $10.0 million in foreign exchange losses primarily related to the substantial liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries.
(b) Represents the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the ANGI Group Term Loan, which was repaid in its entirety during the second quarter of 2021.
(c) Includes $51.5 million in impairments related to investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values and $7.5 million in impairments of a note receivable and a warrant related to certain investees in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income tax (provision) benefit
For further details of income tax matters, see "Note 3-Income Taxes" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
In 2021, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, partially offset by state taxes, an increase in the valuation allowance on beginning-of-the-year deferred tax assets related to the Spin-off, and non-deductible transaction-related items associated with the acquisition of Meredith.
In 2020, the income tax benefit was due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the Desktop impairment.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021 and 2020 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in Angi Inc.'s losses. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021 also includes a third party interest in a subsidiary that holds two marketable equity securities that the Company recorded gains on in 2021. The Company sold its shares in one of the investments in the third quarter of 2021.
PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Company reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The Company endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
Definition of Non-GAAP Measure
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.
The following table reconciles net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA:
For a reconciliation of operating (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see "Note 13-Segment Information" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded from Our Non-GAAP Measure
Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense associated with awards that were granted under various IAC stock and annual incentive plans and expense related to awards issued by certain subsidiaries of the Company. These expenses are not paid in cash and we view the economic costs of stock-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; we also include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding for GAAP earnings per share using the treasury stock method. The Company is currently settling all stock-based awards on a net basis; IAC remits the required tax-withholding amounts for net-settled awards from its current funds.
Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our buildings, capitalized software, leasehold improvements and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as advertiser relationships, licensee relationships, trade names, technology, subscriber relationships, service professional relationships, customer lists and user base, memberships and content, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.
FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial Position
The Company's international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences. During the year ending December 31, 2021, international cash totaling $20.6 million was repatriated to the U.S.
For a detailed description of long-term debt, see "Note 8-Long-term Debt" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Cash Flow Information
In summary, IAC's cash flows are as follows:
Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations consists of net earnings adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of changes in working capital, and acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (to the extent greater than the liability initially recognized at the time of acquisition). Non-cash adjustments include the unrealized gain on the investment in MGM, goodwill impairments, stock-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, amortization of intangibles, unrealized (increase) decrease in the estimated fair value of a warrant, provision for credit losses, depreciation, net (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, non-cash lease expense (including right-of-use asset impairments), and pension and postretirement benefit expense.
Adjustments to net earnings attributable to continuing operations consist primarily of an unrealized gain on the investment in MGM of $789.3 million, an unrealized increase in the estimated fair value of a warrant of $104.0 million, and net gains on investments in equity securities of $40.6 million, partially offset by deferred taxes of $133.4 million, provision of credit losses of $89.9 million, stock-based compensation expense of $79.5 million, depreciation of $75.0 million, amortization of intangibles of $74.8 million, non-cash lease expense (including right-of-use asset impairments) of $35.7 million, and pension and postretirement benefit expense of $18.2 million. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in accounts receivable of $157.0 million and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $31.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $82.8 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $8.3 million. The increase in accounts receivable is due primarily to revenue growth at Angi Inc., primarily attributable to Angi Services, and an increase at Search due primarily to revenue growth, partially offset by timing of cash receipts. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is due to cash payments on leases net of interest accretion. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is due primarily to increases in (i) accrued traffic acquisition costs and related payables at Search, (ii) accrued advertising and related payables at Angi Inc., (iii) accrued professional fees at Dotdash Meredith, primarily related to transaction-related costs associated with the acquisition of Meredith, and (iv) customer deposit liability due to the inclusion of Meredith, partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation costs due primarily to a decrease in deferred payroll tax payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and payments of cash bonuses. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to the growth in subscription sales at Care.com.
Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations includes cash used for acquisitions of $2.7 billion, principally related to the acquisitions of Meredith at Dotdash for $2.7 billion and Angi Roofing at Angi Inc. for $25.4 million, the cash distribution related to the spin-off of Vimeo of $333.2 million, capital expenditures of $90.2 million primarily related to investments in capitalized software at Angi Inc. to support its products and services and payment of $12.7 million related to the purchase of a 50% interest in an aircraft at Corporate, and purchases of investments of $24.3 million, primarily related to Turo, partially offset by maturities of marketable debt securities of $225.0 million and net proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments of $16.5 million, primarily related to the sales of certain investments.
Net cash provided by financing activities attributable to continuing operations includes the borrowings of Dotdash Meredith Term Loans of $1.6 billion, partially offset by a prepayment of the ANGI Group Term Loan of $220.0 million, which otherwise would have matured on November 5, 2023, withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees for stock-based awards that were net settled of $96.0 million, withholding taxes paid on behalf of Angi Inc. employees for stock-based awards that were net settled of $61.9 million, the repurchase of 3.2 million shares of Angi Inc. Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, for $35.4 million at an average price of $11.06 per share, the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $30.3 million, and debt issuance costs of $23.5 million, primarily related to the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans and Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility.
Adjustments to net earnings from continuing operations consist primarily of $840.6 million of the unrealized gain on the investment in MGM and $18.4 million of deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $265.1 million goodwill impairment, $189.0 million of stock-based compensation expense, $126.8 million of amortization of intangibles, including impairments of $32.2 million, $78.9 million of provision for credit losses, $68.8 million of depreciation, $41.1 million of losses on equity securities, net, which includes $51.5 million of impairments of certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values, and non-cash lease expense (including right-of-use asset impairments) of $30.0 million. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in accounts receivable of $131.7 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $29.8 million, an increase in other assets of $24.8 million, and a decrease in income taxes payable and receivable of $11.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $36.0 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $25.1 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at Angi Inc., Care.com, and Dotdash. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is due to cash payments on leases net of interest accretion. The increase in other assets is primarily due to increases in capitalized sales commissions at Angi Inc. and capitalized production costs of various production deals at IAC Films, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized downloadable search toolbar costs at Search. The decrease in income taxes payable and receivable is due primarily to the settlement of audits and 2020 income tax payments in excess of 2020 income tax accruals. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is primarily due to increases in: (i) accrued traffic acquisition costs at Search, (ii) accrued employee compensation due, in part to the deferral of payroll tax payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, partially offset by timing of payments of cash bonuses, (iii) third-party accrued interest at Angi Inc., and (iv) accrued advertising and related payables at Angi Inc. and Mosaic. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to growth in subscription sales at Care.com.
Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations includes $1.0 billion for the purchase of 59.0 million shares of MGM, cash used for investments and acquisitions of $686.4 million, which is primarily related to the Care.com acquisition, purchases (net of maturities) of marketable debt securities of $174.8 million, and capital expenditures of $60.7 million, which is primarily related to investments in capitalized software at Angi Inc. to support their products and services, and leasehold improvements, partially offset by a decrease in notes receivable-related party of $54.8 million, and proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments of $26.1 million, which are primarily related to the sales of Dictionary and Electus in 2018, a portion of the proceeds of which were held in escrow and received in 2020, and the sales of certain investments.
Net cash provided by financing activities attributable to continuing operations includes cash transfers from Old IAC to the Company pursuant to the terms of the MTCH Separation of $1.7 billion and cash merger consideration of $837.9 million paid by Old IAC in connection with the MTCH Separation, proceeds related to the sale of Old IAC Class M common stock of $1.4 billion, and proceeds from the issuance of the ANGI Group Senior Notes of $500.0 million, partially offset by withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees for stock-based awards that were net settled of $85.1 million, withholding taxes paid on behalf of Angi Inc. employees for stock-based awards that were net settled of $64.1 million, the repurchase of 8.5 million shares of Angi Inc. Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, for $63.7 million at an average price of $7.47 per share, principal payments on ANGI Group Term Loan of $27.5 million, including prepayment of the $13.8 million of principal payments that were otherwise due in 2021, debt issuance costs of $6.5 million, and the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $4.3 million.
Discontinued Operations
Net cash provided by discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $319.2 million and $190.5 million, respectively, relates to the operations of Vimeo. The Company does not expect cash flows from discontinued operations following the Spin-off.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Acquisition of Meredith
As discussed above, on December 1, 2021, Dotdash completed the acquisition of Meredith under the terms of an agreement dated as of October 6, 2021 and, following the acquisition, the parent of the combined entity is Dotdash Meredith, Inc. The aggregate purchase price was $2.7 billion.
Financing Arrangements
Dotdash Meredith Term Loans and Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility
On December 1, 2021, Dotdash Meredith, Inc. entered into the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement, which provides for (a) the five-year $350 million Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A, (b) the seven-year $1.25 billion Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B and (c) the five-year $150 million Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility. The proceeds of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Meredith and pay related fees and expenses.
The outstanding balances on the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A and Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B were $350.0 million and $1.25 billion and bore interest at 2.15% and 4.50% at December 31, 2021, respectively. Interest payments are due at least quarterly through maturity of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans. The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A requires quarterly principal payments of $4.4 million through December 31, 2024, $8.8 million through December 31, 2025 and $13.1 million thereafter through maturity. The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B requires quarterly payments of $3.1 million through maturity. Commencing December 31, 2022, pursuant to the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement, the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B may require additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, in part, is governed by the net leverage ratio.
There were no outstanding borrowings under the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility at December 31, 2021. The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is based on the consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement, most recently reported and was 35 basis points at December 31, 2021. Any borrowings under the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility would bear interest, at Dotdash Meredith's option, at either a base rate or term benchmark rate, plus an applicable margin, which is based on Dotdash Meredith's net leverage ratio.
Commencing March 31, 2022, the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement requires Dotdash Meredith to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter of no greater than 5.5 to 1.0 provided that either (i) $1.00 or more is drawn under the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility or Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A, or (ii) the outstanding face amount of undrawn letters of credit, other than cash collateralized letters of credit at 102%, exceeds $25 million, subject to certain increases for qualifying material acquisitions.
The obligations under the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of Dotdash Meredith's wholly-owned subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the assets of Dotdash Meredith and certain of its subsidiaries.
ANGI Group Debt
As of May 6, 2021, the outstanding balance of the ANGI Group Term Loan was repaid in its entirety. The outstanding balance of the ANGI Group Term Loan at December 31, 2020 was $220.0 million and bore interest at 2.16%.
The $250 million ANGI Group Revolving Facility, which otherwise would have expired on November 5, 2023, was terminated effective August 3, 2021. No amounts were ever drawn under the ANGI Group Revolving Facility prior to its termination.
Investment in MGM Resorts International
On February 16, 2022, the Company purchased an additional 4.5 million shares of MGM for $202.5 million. Following this purchase, the Company owns approximately 63.5 million shares, representing a 14.4% ownership interest in MGM as of February 16, 2022.
Share Repurchase Authorizations and Activity
At December 31, 2021, IAC has 8.0 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Angi Inc. repurchased 3.2 million shares of its Class A common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average price of $11.06 per share, or $35.4 million in aggregate. From January 1, 2022 through February 11, 2022, Angi Inc. repurchased an additional 1.0 million shares at an average price of $7.80, or $8.1 million in aggregate. Angi Inc. has 15.0 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization as of February 11, 2022.
IAC and Angi Inc. may purchase their shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
Outstanding Stock-based Awards
IAC and Angi Inc. may settle stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and restricted stock on a gross or a net basis based upon factors deemed relevant at the time. To the extent that equity awards are settled on a net basis, the holders of the awards receive shares of IAC or Angi Inc., as applicable, with a value equal to the fair value of the award on the vest date for RSUs and restricted stock and with a value equal to the intrinsic value of the award upon exercise for stock options or stock settled appreciation rights less, in each case, an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment, which will be paid by IAC or Angi Inc., as applicable, on the employee's behalf. All awards are being settled currently on a net basis.
Certain previously issued Angi Inc. stock appreciation rights are settleable in either shares of Angi Inc. common stock or shares of IAC common stock at IAC's option. If settled in IAC common stock, Angi Inc. reimburses IAC in shares of Angi Inc.'s common stock.
The following table summarizes (i) the aggregate intrinsic value of IAC options, Angi Inc. options, Angi Inc. stock settled stock appreciation rights, IAC and Angi Inc. non-publicly traded subsidiary denominated stock settled stock appreciation rights and (ii) the aggregate fair value (based on stock prices as of February 11, 2022) of IAC and Angi Inc. RSUs and IAC restricted stock outstanding as of that date; assuming these awards were net settled on that date, the withholding taxes that would be paid by the Company on behalf of employees upon exercise or vesting that would be payable (assuming these equity awards are net settled with a 50% tax rate), and the shares that would have been issued are as follows:
_______________
(a) The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards and the cash withholding tax obligation may vary significantly as a result of the determination of the fair value of the relevant subsidiary at the time of exercise. In addition, the number of shares required to settle these awards will be impacted by movement in the stock price of IAC.
(b) The Company has the discretion to settle these awards net of withholding tax and exercise price (which is represented in the table above) or settle on a gross basis and require the award holder to pay its share of the withholding tax, which he or she may do by selling IAC common shares. Assuming all IAC stock options outstanding on February 11, 2022 were settled on a gross basis, i.e., through the issuance of a number of IAC common shares equal to the number of stock options exercised, the Company would have issued 2.9 million common shares and would have received $40.5 million in cash proceeds. These amounts reflect adjustments made to IAC awards upon the completion of the Spin-off.
(c) Approximately 80% of the estimated withholding taxes payable on shares that will vest after December 31, 2022 is related to awards that are scheduled to cliff vest in 2025, the five-year anniversary of the grant date.
(d) On November 5, 2020, the Company granted 3.0 million shares of IAC restricted common stock to its CEO, that cliff vest on the ten-year anniversary of the grant date based on satisfaction of IAC's stock price targets and continued employment through the vesting date.
(e) Includes stock options, RSUs and subsidiary denominated equity.
(f) Pursuant to the employee matters agreement between IAC and Angi Inc., certain stock appreciation rights of Angi, Inc. and equity awards denominated in shares of Angi Inc.'s subsidiaries may be settled in either shares of Angi Inc. common stock or IAC common stock. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, Angi Inc. is obligated to reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing shares of Angi Inc. common stock.
For a detailed description of employee stock-based awards, see "Note 12-Stock-Based Compensation" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Contractual Obligations
The Company enters into various contractual arrangements as a part of its continued operations. At December 31, 2021, material obligations discussed in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included principal and interest payments on the Company's long-term debt discussed above and in "Note 8-Long-Term Debt," operating leases discussed in "Note 14-Leases," and pension and postretirement benefits discussed in "Note 17-Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans."
In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Company has material purchase obligations which represent legally binding agreements to purchase goods and services that specify all significant terms. These obligations are discussed in "Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Capital and Other Expenditures
The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2022 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2021 capital expenditures of $90.2 million by approximately 20% to 30%, primarily due to the development of capitalized software to support products and services at Dotdash Meredith and Angi Inc.
Liquidity Assessment
At December 31, 2021, the Company's consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities, excluding MGM, was $2.1 billion, of which $428.1 million and $233.4 million was held by Angi Inc. and Dotdash Meredith, respectively. After giving effect to the purchase of the additional 4.5 million shares of MGM for $202.5 million on February 16, 2022, the cash held by the Company at December 31, 2021, exclusive of cash held by Angi and Dotdash Meredith, would have been $1.3 billion. The Company's consolidated debt includes $1.6 billion, which is a liability of Dotdash Meredith, Inc., a subsidiary of IAC, and $500.0 million, which is a liability of ANGI Group, a subsidiary of Angi Inc. The Company generated $118.9 million of operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $11.2 million and $6.2 million was generated by Dotdash Meredith and Angi Inc., respectively. Angi Inc. is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, the Company cannot freely access the cash of Angi Inc. and its subsidiaries. In addition, the terms of the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement contain covenants that would limit Dotdash Meredith’s ability to pay dividends or make distributions in the event a default has occurred or if Dotdash Meredith’s consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement) exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. There were no such limitations at December 31, 2021.
The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services due to COVID-19 or other factors. As described in the "COVID-19 Update" section above, to date, the COVID-19 outbreak and measures designed to curb its spread have adversely impacted the Company's businesses.
The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all, which may also be impacted by any disruptions in the financial markets caused by COVID-19 or otherwise. The indebtedness at the Company's subsidiaries could further limit its ability to raise incremental financing.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in "Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements
Acquisitions, which are generally referred to in GAAP as business combinations, are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $2.7 billion and $685.2 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
Management makes two critical determinations at the time of an acquisition: (1) the reporting unit that will benefit from the acquisition and to which goodwill will be assigned and (2) the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired business to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their fair values. The reporting unit determination is important beyond the initial allocation of purchase price because future impairment assessments of goodwill, as described below, are performed at the reporting unit level. Historically, when the Company’s acquisitions have been complementary to existing reporting units, for example, the 2021 acquisition of Total Home Roofing by Angi Inc., the goodwill is allocated to an existing reporting unit. Acquisitions within the Emerging & Other reportable segment, such as Care.com in 2020, usually result in the creation of a new reporting unit because it is a standalone business with unique product offerings, management or target markets, for example. The acquisition of Meredith closed on December 1, 2021. The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and determination of the reporting units for Meredith is still in process of being assessed. Once that is completed the determination of fair value of the reporting units will need to be determined so that goodwill can be allocated. Therefore, the allocation of goodwill for the acquisition of Meredith is not complete as of December 31, 2021. See "Note 5-Business Combinations" in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the preliminary status of the accounting for this business combination.
The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based upon their fair values and is complex because of the judgments involved in determining these values. The determination of purchase price and the fair value of monetary assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically the least complex aspect of the Company’s accounting for business combinations due to management’s experience and/or the inherently lower level of judgment required. Due to the higher degree of complexity associated with the valuation of acquired intangible assets, the Company usually obtains the assistance of outside valuation experts in the allocation of purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired, which can be both definite-lived, such as advertiser/customer relationships and acquired technology, or indefinite lived, such as acquired trade names and trademarks. While outside valuation experts may be used, management has the ultimate responsibility for the valuation methods, models and inputs used and the resulting purchase price allocation. The excess purchase price over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) expected to benefit from the business combination as of the acquisition date.
In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. The premise underlying the accounting for contingent consideration arrangements is that there are divergent views as to the acquired company’s valuation between the Company and the selling shareholders of the acquiree. Therefore, a model is developed with future payments of a portion of the purchase price linked to one or more financial (e.g., revenue and/or profit performance) and/or operating (e.g., number of subscribers) metrics that will be achieved over a specified time frame in the future based upon the performance of the business. In keeping with the accounting guidance for business combinations, each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and the fair value is included in the aggregate purchase price. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the financial statements. The number of scenarios used is typically greater for longer-term arrangements. The contingent consideration arrangements are reassessed and reflected at current fair values for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "General and administrative expense" in the statement of operations. Significant changes in the specified forecasted financial or operating metrics can result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, which can result in volatility of general and administrative expense as the resulting remeasurement gains and losses are recorded.
Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The carrying value of goodwill is $3.2 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $679.1 million and $246.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. In performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company has the option under GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value; if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment, the Company does not perform a quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit, as of October 1. GAAP provides a not all-inclusive set of examples of macroeconomic, industry, market and company specific factors for entities to consider in performing the qualitative assessment described above; management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments. While the Company also has the option under GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1, in part, because the level of effort required to perform the quantitative and qualitative assessments is essentially equivalent.
If the conclusion of our qualitative assessment is that there are indicators of impairment and a quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment equal to the excess is recorded.
The Company’s annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time the Company changes its operating segments. If the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly formed reporting units, the allocation is usually made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values.
For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2021, a qualitative assessment of the Angi Inc., Care.com, Bluecrew and Vivian Health reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:
•Angi Inc.'s October 1, 2021 market capitalization of $6.2 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $5.0 billion.
•The Company prepared valuations of the Care.com, Bluecrew and Vivian Health reporting units primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity awards that are denominated in the equity of these businesses during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2021. The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2021 carrying value.
For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2021, the Company quantitatively tested the Mosaic Group reporting unit. The Company's quantitative test indicated that there was no impairment. The Company's Ask Media Group, Desktop, The Daily Beast, IAC Films and Newco reporting units have no goodwill as of October 1, 2021.
The aggregate carrying value of goodwill for which the most recent estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value is less than 20% is approximately $243.0 million.
The fair value of the Company's reporting units (except for Angi Inc. described above) is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its non-public subsidiary denominated stock-based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative test. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units was 15.0% in both 2021 and 2020 (for the Mosaic Group reporting unit). Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. The future cash flows are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10.0% to 40.0% in 2021 and 11.5% to 25.0% in 2020, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1.0% to 5.0% in 2021 and 1.0% to 5.5% in 2020.
If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. There are no indefinite-lived intangible assets for which the most recent estimate of the excess fair value over carrying value is less than 20%.
The October 1, 2021 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not identify any impairments.
In the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company determined that the effects of COVID-19 were an indicator of possible impairment for certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and identified impairments of $212.0 million and $21.4 million related to the goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Desktop reporting unit.
In the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company reassessed the fair values of the Desktop reporting unit and the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded impairments equal to the remaining carrying value of the goodwill of $53.2 million and $10.8 million related to the intangible assets. The reduction in the Company’s fair value estimates of the Desktop business in the first and third quarters of 2020 was primarily due to lower consumer queries, increasing challenges in monetization and the reduced ability to market profitably due to policy changes implemented by Google and other browsers. The effects of COVID-19 on monetization were an additional factor.
The October 1, 2020 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not identify any additional impairments.
Impairment charges recorded on indefinite-lived intangibles are included in "Amortization of intangibles" in the accompanying statement of operations.
Recoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets
We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising right-of-use assets ("ROU assets"), buildings, capitalized software, leasehold improvements and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is $1.8 billion and $593.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the Company's net deferred tax liability is $383.2 million and $76.6 million, respectively.
The Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $18.0 million and $20.1 million, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
The ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
The Company was included within Old IAC’s tax group for purposes of federal and consolidated state income tax return filings through June 30, 2020, the date of the MTCH Separation. For periods prior thereto, the income tax benefit and/or provision was computed for the Company on an as if standalone, separate return basis and payments to and refunds from Old IAC for the Company’s share of Old IAC’s consolidated federal and state tax return liabilities/receivables calculated on this basis have been reflected within cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
Stock-Based Compensation
The stock-based compensation expense reflected in our statements of operations includes expense related to equity awards issued by certain of our subsidiaries (including awards assumed in acquisitions, including the transaction resulting in the formation of Angi Inc. in 2017, referred to as the "Combination") and, for periods prior to the MTCH Separation, an allocation of expense from Old IAC related to awards issued to the Company's employees that were granted under various Old IAC stock and annual incentive plans. The form of awards granted to the Company's employees are principally restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based RSUs, market-based RSUs, restricted stock and stock options.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $79.5 million and $189.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in the stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 are modification charges of $56.0 million related to the MTCH Separation, and $28.2 million related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into Angi Inc. equity awards in the Combination.
Stock-based compensation at the Company is complex due to our desire to attract, retain, inspire and reward our management team and employees at each of our subsidiaries, including those employed by recently acquired companies, by allowing them to benefit directly from the value they help to create. We accomplish these objectives, in part, by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our non-publicly subsidiaries as well as in IAC and Angi Inc. We further refine this approach by tailoring certain equity awards to the applicable circumstances. For example, we issue certain equity awards for which vesting is linked to the achievement of a performance target such as revenue or profits; these awards are referred to as performance-based awards. In other cases, we link the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of a value target for a subsidiary or IAC or Angi Inc.'s stock price, as applicable; these awards are referred to as market-based awards. The nature and variety of these types of equity-based awards creates complexity in our determination of stock-based compensation expense.
In addition, acquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. These transactions may result in the modification of equity awards, which creates additional complexity and additional stock-based compensation expense. For example, the Combination resulted in the conversion of previously issued HomeAdvisor and Angi’s awards into Angi Inc. awards, and the recognition of additional stock-based compensation expense. In addition, our spin-offs and internal reorganizations can also lead to modifications of equity awards and result in additional complexity and stock-based compensation expense. For example, the MTCH Separation resulted in the conversion of Old IAC denominated stock options into stock options to purchase IAC common stock and stock options to purchase New Match common stock in a manner that preserved the spread value of the stock options immediately before and immediately after the adjustment, and the recognition of additional stock-based compensation expense.
Finally, the means by which we settle our equity-based awards also introduces complexity into our financial reporting. We provide a path to liquidity by settling the non-public subsidiary denominated awards in IAC or Angi Inc. shares, as applicable. In addition, certain former Angi Inc. subsidiary denominated awards and Angi Inc. stock appreciation rights can be settled in IAC or Angi Inc. awards at the Company’s election. These features increase the complexity of our earnings per share calculations.
The Company estimated the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights issued (including those modified in connection with the MTCH Separation and the Combination) using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $3.3 million, $5.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The Company also issues RSUs, performance-based RSUs, market-based RSUs and restricted stock. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For performance-based RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. For market-based RSUs, a lattice model is used to estimate the value of the awards. For our currently outstanding restricted stock, a lattice model was used to estimate the fair value of the award which is based on the satisfaction of IAC's stock price targets.
Investments in Equity Securities
The Company invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy. Our equity securities, other than those of our consolidated subsidiaries and those accounted for under the equity method, are accounted for at fair value or under the measurement alternative of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities, with any changes to fair value recognized in "Other income (expense), net" in the statement of operations each reporting period. Under the measurement alternative, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer; fair value is generally determined based on a market approach as of the transaction date. A security will be considered identical or similar if it has identical or similar rights to the equity securities held by the Company. The Company reviews its investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values for impairment each reporting period when there are qualitative factors or events that indicate possible impairment. Factors we consider in making this determination include negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company prepares quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments in equity securities, which require judgment and the use of estimates. When our assessment indicates that the fair value of the investment is below its carrying value, the Company writes down the investment to its fair value and records the corresponding charge in "Other income (expense), net" in the statement of operations.
The carrying value of the Company’s equity securities without readily determinable fair values is $324.6 million and $296.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in "Long-term investments" in the balance sheet. As described in the "COVID-19 Update" section, in the first quarter of 2020 the Company recognized unrealized impairments or downward adjustments of $51.5 million related to certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values.
The Company has one investment in a current marketable equity security at December 31, 2021, which is carried at fair value following the investee's initial public offering in 2021; prior to this investee's initial public offering, the investment was accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. The Company recorded an unrealized gain of $18.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 for this investment. The Company sold its shares in another marketable equity security in the third quarter of 2021, which, prior to this investee's initial public offering, was accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value, and recorded a net realized gain of $7.2 million on the sale of this investment. The realized and unrealized gains related to these investments are included in "Other income (expense), net" in the statement of operations.
During the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company purchased 59.0 million shares of MGM. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the Company's investment in MGM is $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The fair value of the investment in MGM is remeasured each reporting period based upon MGM's closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange and any unrealized gains or losses are included in the statement of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized unrealized gains of $789.3 million and $840.5 million, respectively, on its investment in MGM. On February 16, 2022, the Company purchased an additional 4.5 million shares of MGM for $202.5 million. Following this purchase, the Company owns approximately 63.5 million shares, representing a 14.4% ownership interest in MGM as of February 16, 2022.
