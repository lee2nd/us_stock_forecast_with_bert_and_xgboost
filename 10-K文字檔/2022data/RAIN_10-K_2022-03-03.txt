Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements based upon our current plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” and included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully read the sections titled “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described below.
Overview
We are a late-stage precision oncology company developing therapies that target oncogenic drivers for which we are able to genetically select patients we believe will be most likely to benefit. This approach includes using a tumor-agnostic strategy to select patients based on their tumors’ underlying genetics rather than histology. We have in-licensed product candidates, each with a differentiated profile relative to available therapies, and we intend to continue strengthening our pipeline through focused business development and internal research efforts.
Our lead product candidate, milademetan (also known as RAIN-32) is a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), which may be oncogenic in numerous cancers. We in-licensed milademetan from Daiichi Sankyo in September 2020 based on the results of a Phase 1 clinical trial, which demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of liposarcoma (LPS) and other solid tumors. Data from well-differentiated/de-differentiated (WD/DD) liposarcoma LPS patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of milademetan demonstrated median progression-free survival (mPFS) of approximately seven to eight months. Importantly, this result was accomplished with a rationally designed dosing schedule designed to mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition unlocking the potential for milademetan in a broad range of MDM2-dependent cancers. Based on these data, we commenced a pivotal Phase 3 trial in LPS (MANTRA) in July 2021. We also commenced a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors (MANTRA-2) in November 2021. We anticipate commencing a Phase 2 clinical trial in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) (MANTRA-3) in the second half of 2022 and a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of milademetan in combination with atezolizumab in patients with loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and wildtype p53 advanced solid tumors (MANTRA-4) in the second half of 2022. In addition to milademetan, we are also developing a preclinical program that is focused on inducing synthetic lethality in cancer cells by inhibiting RAD52.
Since our inception in 2017, we have incurred significant operating losses and have utilized substantially all of our resources to date in-licensing and developing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our Company and providing other general and administrative support for our operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $90.0 million and we incurred net losses of approximately $51.4 million and $21.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our operations to date have been funded primarily through the issuance of convertible promissory notes, the issuance of convertible preferred stock, as well as issuance and sale of common stock through our initial public offering (IPO). From our inception through December 31, 2021, we have raised aggregate gross proceeds of $9.9 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and $81.9 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock. On April 27, 2021, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 7,352,941 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. On May 11, 2021, we issued an additional 492,070 shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares at the public offering price. Our net proceeds from the sale of shares in the IPO, including the sale of shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, was $121.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering fees. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $140.2 million. Although we believe, based on our current business plans, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will require additional capital in the future in order to continue the research and development of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product
candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products, seek to expand our product pipeline, invest in our organization, as well as incur expenses associated with operating as a public company.
We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, which will not be for many years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources which may include strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements or other arrangements with third parties. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we raise funds through strategic collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our platform technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening of global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses and cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities. Based upon our current operating plan, we estimate that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund our pivotal Phase 3 data timelines in LPS, Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors, a Phase 2 trial in MCC, and a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of milademetan in combination with atezolizumab in patients with loss of CDKN2A and wildtype p53 advanced solid tumors, including continuing to advance our pipeline through additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. For the milademetan program, we have transferred Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) processes to suitable contract manufacturing organizations to supply active pharmaceutical ingredients and clinical drug product for our clinical trials and in preparation for submission of marketing applications and potential future commercial supplies.
COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our clinical trial enrollment, clinical trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs), third-party manufacturers and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications, and most of our employees are working remotely. The increased reliance on our personnel working from home has not negatively impacted productivity, or disrupted, delayed or otherwise seriously harmed our business. The collection and integrity of subject data and clinical trial endpoints have not been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor the evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, including the ability of the FDA and other regulatory authorities to perform routine functions or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. If global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect
our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans, including the resulting impact on our expenditures and capital needs, remains uncertain and is subject to change.
Recent Developments
In January 2022, we announced a clinical supply agreement with Roche for the supply of the anti-Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, atezolizumab. Clinical trials are planned to evaluate milademetan in combination with atezolizumab for the treatment of patients in genetically selected populations (MANTRA-4). Under this agreement, Rain is the sponsor of the anticipated clinical trials, and Roche will supply atezolizumab.
In November 2021, the first patient was dosed in the multicenter, single arm, open-label, Phase 2 basket trial evaluating Milademetan for the treatment of MDM2-amplified advanced solid (MANTRA-2).
In November 2021, we announced our plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial, named MANTRA-3, evaluating the efficacy of milademetan as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with MCC refractory to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in the second half of 2022.
We hosted an R&D day webinar on November 9, 2021, which featuring several key opinion leaders in oncology, along with members of Rain’s management team, who discussed our R&D program, as well as select clinical and preclinical data.
We, in collaboration with certain research partners, presented non-clinical data on milademetan at the IASLC 2021 World Conference of Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (Sept. 8-14, 2021) and at the AACR-NCI-EORTC (Triple Cancer Conference) 2021 on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics virtual conference (Oct. 7-10, 2021), highlighting non-clinical data in MDM2-amplified tumors, MCC, GATA3-mutant ER+ breast cancer, and mesothelioma models. On the strength of recent non-clinical data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute presented at the Triple Cancer Conference, we are now prioritizing our financial resources towards a Phase 2 clinical trial of milademetan as monotherapy in MCC patients failing first-line checkpoint inhibitors, with a clinical trial commencement expected in the second half of 2022. The Phase 2 clinical trial of milademetan in MCC (MANTRA-3) will replace the previously planned Phase 2 clinical trial of milademetan in intimal sarcoma. We do not expect the new planned MCC trial to have significant net impact on our financial condition, cash flow or results of operations.
In July 2021, we announced that the first patient has been randomized in the multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational trial (MANTRA) evaluating milademetan for the treatment of DD LPS.
In June 2021, we announced a patient referral partnership with Caris Life Sciences (Caris). Under the terms of the partnership, Caris will provide patient referral services using their molecular intelligence trials platform for our Phase 2 MDM2-amplified tumor-agnostic basket trial for milademetan (MANTRA-2).
Also in June 2021, we announced a master program and a genomic analysis platform agreement for comprehensive genomic profiling tests utilizing the genomic analysis platform of Tempus, an artificial intelligence and precision medicine company. Under the terms of the agreement, Tempus will provide both centralized tumor testing and patient matching services using their Connect & TIME Trial® Network for the Phase 2 MDM2-amplified tumor-agnostic basket trial for milademetan (MANTRA-2).
Our Development Pipeline
Our development pipeline is unified by a strategy to target oncogenic drivers through differentiated therapies for which we are able to genetically select the patients we believe will be most likely to benefit from treatment. We currently retain global development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates. See Part 1, Item 1. “Business - Our Development Pipeline”.
Collaboration and License Agreements
We are party to a number of license agreements for the in-license of our product candidates and development programs. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales, licenses or collaborations and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue from future product sales. If we enter into license or collaboration agreements for any of our product candidates or intellectual property, we may generate revenue in the future from payments as a result of such license or collaboration agreements. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates or from license or collaboration agreements. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs, including acquisition of in-process research and development, and general and administrative costs.
Research and Development Expenses
To date, our research and development expenses have related to the discovery and clinical development of our product candidates, including acquisition of in-process research and development. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.
Research and development expenses include:
•
salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts;
•
expenses incurred in connection with research, laboratory consumables and preclinical studies;
•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and consultants to conduct and support our planned clinical trials of our product candidates;
•
the cost of consultants engaged in research and development-related services and the cost to manufacture drug product for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
costs related to regulatory compliance;
•
the cost of annual license fees and the cost of acquiring in-process research and development, including upfront license payments; and
•
any development milestone payments that we may make under our license agreements.
We track external development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates as our personnel works across multiple development programs and product candidates. These costs are included in unallocated research and development expenses in the table below.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program:
We plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand the development of our product candidates. The clinical development timeline, probability
of success of clinical trials and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
Our future clinical development costs may vary significantly. See the section titled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Product Development- Preclinical and clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results. If our preclinical studies and clinical trials are not sufficient to support regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development of such product candidates”.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and other administrative functions, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and facility-related costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, pre-commercial preparation activities for our product candidates and, if any product candidate receives marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest on our available-for-sale (AFS) securities.
Interest Expense
We did not have interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense for year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of interest on the outstanding convertible promissory notes.
Change in Fair Value of Convertible Promissory Notes
We issued convertible promissory notes in October 2019 (the 2019 Notes) and June 2020 (the 2020 Notes) for which we had elected the fair value option. We adjusted the carrying value of our convertible promissory notes to their estimated fair value at each reporting date, with any change in fair value of the convertible promissory notes recorded as an increase or decrease to change in fair value of convertible promissory notes in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The fair value of the 2019 Notes and the 2020 Notes were estimated using a scenario-based analysis that estimated the fair value of the convertible promissory notes based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering possible outcomes available to the noteholders, including conversions in subsequent equity financings, settlement and dissolution.
On September 2, 2020, upon consummation of our Series B convertible preferred stock financing, the principal balance plus accrued interest earned on the 2019 Notes and the 2020 Notes automatically converted into 1,905,688 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. Upon conversion, we no longer are required to adjust the carrying value of the convertible promissory notes at each reporting date.
Income Taxes
We are subject to corporate U.S. federal and state income taxation. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $69.2 million and $27.8 million respectively. $0.2 million of the $69.2 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2037 and the remaining $69.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The yearly utilization of such federal net operating loss carryforwards is limited to 80 percent of taxable income. On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which may provide some relief from such limitations. The state tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2031, if not utilized. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal
and state research and development tax credits of approximately $3.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research tax credit will begin to expire in 2039. The California research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely.
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and similar state provisions. Specifically, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership by 5% stockholders over a three-year period), our ability to use such pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited. As a result of our most recent private placements and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have experienced, and, upon the closing of this offering, may experience, an “ownership change.” We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership.
We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on management’s judgment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes in those items in dollars:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development (R&D) expenses were $40.8 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to milademetan and other research costs, including the milestone fees payable to Daiichi Sankyo of $5.5 million. Non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, included as part of personnel costs, were $2.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect our R&D costs to continue to increase in 2022 as we continue our Phase 3 trial in LPS and our Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial for milademetan.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $10.7 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to director and officer insurance of $2.4 million, payroll-related costs of $2.3 million and various third-party G&A costs of $2.4 million. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in G&A expenses was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have incurred and expect to continue incur additional expenses as a result of being a public company following the completion of our IPO in April 2021, including costs associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements as a public company. In addition, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2022 as we continue to add personnel and build out systems and infrastructure to support our operations as a public company.
Other (Income) Expense
Other (income) expense, net with nominal amounts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 represents interest income, interest expense on the outstanding convertible promissory notes and change in the fair value of our convertible promissory notes recorded in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our research programs and product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with conducting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources.
We do not currently have any approved products and have not generated any revenue from product sales since inception. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of convertible promissory notes and the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock. From our inception through December 31, 2021, we have raised aggregate gross proceeds of $9.9 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and $81.9 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock. On April 27, 2021, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 7,352,941 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. On May 11, 2021, we issued an additional 492,070 shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares at the public offering price. Our net proceeds from the sale of shares in the IPO, including the sale of shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, was $121.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering fees. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $140.2 million. Although we believe, based on our current business plans, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will require additional capital in the future in order to continue the research and development of our drug candidates. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Future Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing development activities related to milademetan and other product candidates and programs, which are still in the early stages of development. In addition, following the IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•
continue our on-going clinical trials, initiate new clinical trials for our milademetan program and incur additional preclinical research costs for our RAD52 program;
•
initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;
•
seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;
•
seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
establish a sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
require the manufacture of larger quantities of our product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;
•
maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;
•
acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies;
•
defend against any claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property;
•
hire and retain additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•
build out new facilities or expand existing facilities to support our ongoing development activity;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development, any future commercialization efforts and our transition to a public company;
•
potentially experience the effects of the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and
•
operate as a public company.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of milademetan and other product candidates and programs and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates and programs. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of our current and future clinical trials of milademetan for our current targeted indications;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical research and clinical trials for RAD52 and other product candidates;
•
the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into or maintaining licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates on favorable terms, although we currently have no commitments or agreements to complete any such transactions;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities;
•
our ability to successfully acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator that we may have at such time;
•
the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Developing drug products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or
results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources which may include strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements or other arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through strategic collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses and cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Operating Activities
We have incurred losses since inception. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $37.5 million, consisting primarily of net loss of $51.4 million resulting from expenses associated with research and development activities for our lead product candidate and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a net decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5.2 million and non-cash adjustments of $8.7 million.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $11.2 million, consisting primarily of net loss of $21.1 million offset by a net decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million and non-cash adjustments of $8.2 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $118.2 million, which was primarily related to purchases of available for sale securities of $163.6 million, and payment of $2.5 million to Daiichi Sankyo for in-process research and development expense, partially offset by maturities of available for sale securities of $48.0 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.2 million, which was primarily for payment to Daiichi Sankyo for in-process research and development expense.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $121.6 million, which primarily relates to the net proceeds from IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering fees.
Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $69.5 million primarily relates to proceeds of $6.4 million from issuance of convertible promissory notes and proceeds of $63.2 million from issuance of convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs.
Obligations and other Commitments
As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are party to agreements to license intellectual property. The license agreements may require us to pay future milestones if certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved, as well as to pay royalties on net sales of products applicable to the license agreements. We cannot estimate if milestone and/or royalty payments will occur in future periods and the agreements are cancelable by us at any time upon prior written notice to the licensor.
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts with CROs and other vendors for preclinical studies and clinical trials, research and development supplies and other testing and manufacturing services. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by either party at any time upon prior written notice.
Our incurred and accrued research and development obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $4.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
We pay the office operating lease obligation at the beginning of each month. Under our office operating leases as noted in Note 10 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our obligation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements.
Accrued Liabilities
We are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants, CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting preclinical activities and clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. However, some payments are made in arrears and expenditures are accrued for the time periods which services are performed on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones.
This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service
performed and the associated cost incurred when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. During the course of a preclinical study or clinical trial, we adjust our prepaid and expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred. The accrued research and development balances were $4.3 million and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The other accrued liabilities balances were $5.7 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
We follow the provision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (ASC 718), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards. We determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.
We estimate the fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to develop subjective estimates to be used in calculating the fair value of stock options. The use of the model requires us to make estimates of subjective assumptions, such as expected stock price volatility and the estimated expected term of each award.
Stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value estimated is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (generally the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. Prior to the IPO, the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock as determined on the date of grant by our Board of Directors. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expense was $3.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The following table summarizes unvested equity compensation costs not yet recognized as of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
