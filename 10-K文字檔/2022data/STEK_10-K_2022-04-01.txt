Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Stemtech’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. Stemtech’s audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Company Overview
Stemtech Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on September 4, 2009. Our registration statement on Form S-1 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission was declared effective on May 15, 2013. On August 19th, 2021, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Stemtech Corporation by which the Company acquired one hundred percent of the shares of Stemtech Corp. in exchange for the issuance of 37,060,000 shares of the Company, approximately 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company.
Stemtech has pioneered and patented a whole new category of dietary supplements. Stemtech’s advanced Stem Cell Nutrition formulations are one-of-a-kind natural products designed to help support the three most important aspects of stem cell physiology: 1) Releasing more stem cells; 2) their circulation in the blood; and 3) Migration into tissues, where they can perform their daily function of renewal and rejuvenation for optimal health. We actually harness the incredible power of adult stem cells. How does this work? Adult stem cells are released from your bone marrow into the bloodstream, they then Circulate in the bloodstream and flow to the tissues most in need. As they arrive, the adult stem cells migrate into the tissues, reproduce and become new, healthy cells of those tissues. This process takes place every single day, even without tissue damage, as part of the natural renewal system of the body. It is important to understand that Stemtech’s products do not contain stem cells. They are composed of natural botanicals and other ingredients that have been clinically documented to support the performance of your own adult stem cells.
While sales of product obviously create the cash flow, our real business model is not just “sales”, but lateral penetration. We do this through our IBPs - “Independent Business Partner” Sales Forces, and we invest much energy in growing our IBPs. Post public listing and funding, Stemtech is projecting the addition of 30,000 new independent business partner reps over the next 12 to 24 months, adding to the existing IBPs. With an enhanced compensation plan, IBPs will be even more incentivized to build their network, attracting additional industry leaders. IBPs are a testimonial to our product and business model, lowering our customer acquisition costs.
In order to grow our company’s IBPs post pandemic, we are now looking at reinstituting contests, travel incentives, cruises, other trips, Business Academies for Training, regional conferences, our Annual Convention with new product launches. Our IBPs offer highly flexible yet steady income which is most adapted to todays “Laptop & Cellphone Lifestyle”, with structured and organized weekly corporate training calls, a personalized website, back-office tracking, oversight and management Tools, Reports, Training Materials and Social Sharing.
While there has actually been no active marketing activity since 2017, our sales continued to come in from returning consumers who believe in the quality products. Until September 2021, the Company had operated on an extremely tight budget, with inadequate working capital and difficulties fulfilling orders. Since the cash infusions noted in “Financing” infra, the company now has the resources to contact and re-engage the over 200,000 former distributors. With this new cash infusion, the Company has engaged experienced marketing and social media professionals to initiate new marketing strategies which are expected to bring increased activity. Moreover, we are now better positioned to absorb significant new clientele as the company has directed significant cash towards our inventory, and we now have enough inventory on hand to fulfill over $3 million dollars’ worth of new orders, an inventory level we have not had since going into bankruptcy in 2017. Management conservatively believes that given the cash on hand and working expenditures as describe above, we can reinvigorate sales to be more consistent with the company’s previous revenue historically, as we were recognized 4 times in the Inc 5000 Magazine’s list of fastest growing companies.
Below this IBP level, we have our “DTC” (Direct To Consumer) network marketing Distribution model. This integrative model allows us an immediate global presence and ability to operate in multiple countries on any continent. We are uniquely positioned in this post pandemic economy beset by supply chain issues, as this method requires no up-front or required buy-in of inventory, with monthly shipments available for known recurring sales. This platform has us now operating at the intersection of the ecommerce economy, social economy and gig economy.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Results of Operations
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net sales were $4,321,245 and $4,384,507, respectively. The decrease of $63,262 is primarily due to the lack of revenue from South Korea operations which generated approximately $160,000 in sales in 2020, partially offset by slight increases overall.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our total operating expenses were $6,508,356 and $5,101,154, respectively. The increase of $949,040 is primarily attributable to an increase in stock compensation granted to vendors and officers in 2021.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total non-operating expenses were $3,900,838 and $295,924, respectively, resulting in an increase of $3,604,914. The difference is primarily due to $8,330,201 of interest expense on notes payable, partially offset by the $4,553,372 gain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities in connection with the note payable issued in September 2021.
Our net loss for the December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $7,111,109 and $1,727,658, respectively. The increase in net loss was caused by the factors described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are not currently profitable, and we cannot provide any assurance of when we will be profitable. We incurred a net loss of $7,111,109 and $1,727,658 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we met our short-term liquidity requirements from our existing cash reserves and proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of $3,321,969.
As of December 31, 2021, our current assets were $1,600,039 compared to $573,100 in current assets at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, our current liabilities were $9,387,038 compared to $3,723,387 at December 31, 2020. Current liabilities at December 31, 2021 were comprised of $4,224,585 of derivative liabilities, $4,050,798 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, $1,055,910 in convertible notes and $55,745 in current operating lease liabilities.
Stockholders’ equity decreased from positive $1,267,996 as of December 31, 2020 to a deficit of $4,005,446 at December 31, 2021. This change was primarily caused by the $4,224,585 addition of derivative liabilities that were bifurcated from the notes payable issued in September 2021.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities were $1,914,093 which is primarily due the change in working capital accounts. The net loss of $7,111,109 and $4,553,372 gain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities was offset by the $6,816,739 non-cash interest expense and $1,031,173 of stock compensation expense. Adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities were due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,217,831, an increase in operating lease liabilities of $99,159, offset by decrease in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $237,778 and $109,122, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows used in operating activities were $266,716.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
We have financed our operations primarily from either the issuance of our shares of common stock or notes payable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $2,628,739 cash from financing activities which consists of $3,321,969 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, partially offset by payments on notes payable of $693,230. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $159,402.
Plan of Operation and Funding
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of equity securities and debt instruments.
Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and director loans. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
