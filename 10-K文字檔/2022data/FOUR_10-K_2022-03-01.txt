ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a leading independent provider of payment acceptance and payment processing and technology solutions in the United States based on total volume of payments processed. We have achieved our leadership position through decades of solving business and operational challenges facing our customers overall commerce needs. We distribute our services through our network of software partners (“ISVs”) and value-added resellers (“VARs”). For our software partners, we offer a single integration to an end-to-end payments offering, a proprietary gateway and a robust suite of technology solutions to enhance the value of their software and simplify payment acceptance. For our merchants, we provide a seamless, unified consumer experience as an alternative to relying on multiple providers to accept card-based payments, while providing the digital tools necessary to provide their end-customers a seamless commerce experience.
At the heart of our business is our payments platform. Our payments platform is a full suite of integrated payment products and services that can be used across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and tablet-based) and industry verticals, including:
•end-to-end payment processing for a broad range of payment types;
•merchant acquiring;
•proprietary omni-channel gateway capable of multiple methods of mobile, contactless and QR code-based payments;
•complementary software integrations;
•full eCommerce capabilities, including web-store design, hosting, shopping cart management and fulfillment integrations;
•integrated and mobile POS solutions;
•security and risk management solutions; and
•reporting and analytical tools.
In addition, we offer innovative technology solutions that go beyond payment processing. Some of our solutions are developed in-house, such as business intelligence and POS software, while others are powered by our network of complementary third-party applications. Our focus on innovation combined with our product-driven culture enables us to create scalable technology solutions that benefit from an extensive library of intellectual property.
We have a partner-centric distribution approach. We market and sell our solutions through a diversified network of over 7,000 software partners, which consists of ISVs and VARs. ISVs are technology providers that develop commerce-enabling software suites with which they can bundle our payments platform. VARs are organizations that provide distribution support for ISVs and act as trusted and localized service providers to merchants by providing them with software and services. Together, our ISVs and VARs provide us immense distribution scale and provide our merchants with front-line service and support.
Our end-to-end payments offering combines our payments platform, including our proprietary gateway and breadth of software integrations, and our suite of technology solutions to create a compelling value proposition for our merchants. Our end-to-end payment volume was $46.7 billion, $24.3 billion, and $22.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. This end-to-end payment volume contributed approximately 62%, 61%, and 57% of gross revenue less network fees for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Our merchants range from small to medium sized businesses (“SMBs”) to large enterprises across numerous verticals, including food and beverage, hospitality, stadiums and arenas, gaming, specialty retail, non-profits and eCommerce.
Recent developments
Stock Repurchases
On December 16, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the commencement of a stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”) and will expire on December 31, 2022.
Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization.
This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Common Stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.
As of December 31, 2021, we repurchased 378,475 shares of Common Stock for $21.1 million, including commissions paid, at an average price paid of $55.81 per share, which is recorded within “Treasury stock” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $78.9 million remained available for future purchases under the program.
In January 2022, we repurchased 245,700 shares of Common stock for $13.9 million, including commissions paid, at an average price paid of $56.48 per share. As of February 23, 2022, approximately $65.0 million remained available for future purchases under the program.
TSYS outage
In August 2021, TSYS, a Global Payments Company and an important vendor to the Company, experienced a significant platform outage that resulted in the disruption of payment processing for our merchants (“TSYS outage”). TSYS is utilized by many major credit card issuers and payment processors, which meant the impact of the outage was felt by many card accepting merchants and cardholders across the nation. In response to the TSYS outage, we distributed payments to both merchants and partners in order to alleviate the impact of the outage on their businesses. The following paragraphs describe how these payments are reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we distributed $22.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in payments to our merchants to approximate the lost revenues they experienced as a result of the TSYS outage. Under ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), these payments were recorded as contra revenue, which is reflected as a reduction of “Gross revenue” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. These payments are considered nonrecurring and are therefore reflected as an adjustment when calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Revenue Less Network Fees. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2021, gross revenue less network fees excludes the impact of the TSYS outage.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we also distributed $2.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in payments to our partners to approximate their lost revenues and compensate them for the additional support required from them to manage the outage. Consistent with the treatment of our payments to our partners in the normal course of business, these payments are reflected as an increase to “Cost of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. These payments are considered nonrecurring and are therefore reflected as an adjustment when calculating Adjusted EBITDA.
See Note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about the TSYS outage and Key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and gross revenue less network fees.
Convertible Notes Offering - 2027 Notes
In July 2021, we issued an aggregate $632.5 million of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (“2027 Convertible Notes”) to qualified institutional buyers in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. We received net proceeds, after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $617.7 million from the 2027 Convertible Notes offering. The net proceeds of the 2027 Convertible Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, will be used for general corporate purposes.
Advertising and marketing
In the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $20.8 million in expenses related to the integration of 3dcart as it was rebranded as Shift4Shop. These expenses are anticipated to be nonrecurring in nature.
Investments in securities
As of December 31, 2021, we invested $27.5 million in Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (“SpaceX”), which designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets, spacecraft and satellites, $2.0 million in Sightline Payments, Inc. (“Sightline Payments”), a financial technology company that provides cashless, mobile, and omni-channel commerce solutions for the gaming, lottery, sports betting and other industries and $1.0 million in MagicCube, a software company that allows any android mobile device to function as a fully secure, EMV-certified, payment acceptance device, significantly reducing the cost and complexity associated with traditional hardware deployments. Additionally, in January 2022, we invested $1.0 million in Interchecks Technologies, Inc. (“Interchecks”), one of the fastest growing instant payment infrastructure and service providers for the online gaming, fintech, and digital ecosystem verticals.
Recent acquisitions
Finaro
On March 1, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Credorax, Inc. d/b/a Finaro (“Finaro”) for approximately $200.0 million in cash, $325.0 million in shares of our Class A common stock and a performance-based earnout of up to $50.0 million in shares of our Class A common stock. Consummation of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals. Finaro is a cross-border eCommerce platform and bank specializing in solving complex payment problems for multi-national merchants that we believe will accelerate our growth in international markets.
The Giving Block
On February 28, 2022, we acquired The Giving Block, Inc. (“The Giving Block”) for approximately $13.5 million in cash, $40.5 million in shares of our Class A common stock and a performance-based earnout of up to $61.5 million in cash and $184.5 million in shares of our Company’s Class A common stock. The Giving Block is a cryptocurrency donation marketplace that we believe will accelerate our growth in the non-profit sector with significant cross-sell potential.
Postec
In September 2021, we acquired Postec, Inc. (“Postec”), for $14.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired. This acquisition enables the boarding of the vendor’s customers on our end-to-end acquiring solution and empowers our distribution partners to sign the vendor’s customer accounts and leverage the combined expertise to handle all aspects of installation, service, and support. See Note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
VenueNext
In March 2021, we acquired VenueNext Inc. (“VenueNext”), a leader in integrated payments solutions in sporting arenas and event complexes, for $66.9 million in aggregate purchase consideration, net of cash acquired. We believe this acquisition enhances our presence and capabilities in a number of large and growing verticals such as stadiums and arenas, while significantly expanding our total addressable market with entry into entertainment, universities, theme parks, airports, and other verticals. See Note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility
In January 2021, Shift4 Payments, LLC amended and restated its First Lien Credit Agreement and increased the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility to $100.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on January 29, 2026 or, if greater than $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes remains outstanding on September 15, 2025, on that date. The Revolving Credit Facility requires periodic interest payments until maturity.
Loans incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either the LIBO rate plus a margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% per year or the alternate base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or the prime rate announced from time to time in The Wall Street Journal) plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% per year (“Applicable Rate”). The Applicable Rate varies depending on the Company’s total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The alternate base rate and the LIBO rate are each subject to a zero percent floor. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate ranging from 0.25% per year to 0.50% per year, in each case based on the total leverage ratio. We are also subject to customary letter of credit and agency fees. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
COVID-19 Pandemic Update
While great progress has been made in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic remains a global challenge and continues to impact international travel and corporate travel patterns, both of which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our financial performance could be adversely impacted by any local or government-imposed pandemic restrictions, although we are currently unable to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to COVID-19, see risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
Factors impacting our business and results of operations
In general, our results of operations are impacted by factors such as adoption of software solutions that are integrated with our payment solutions, continued investment in our core capabilities, on-going pursuit of strategic acquisitions, and macro-level economic trends.
Increased adoption of software-integrated payments. We primarily generate revenue through fees assessed on end-to-end payment volume initiated through our integrated software partners. These fees include volume-based payments, transaction fees and subscription fees for software and technology solutions. We expect to grow this volume by attracting new integrated software partners through our market-leading and innovative solutions. These integrated software partners have proven to be an effective and efficient way of acquiring new merchants and servicing these relationships.
Continued focus on converting our gateway-only customers to our end-to-end payments offering. Currently, a large percentage of our merchant base relies only on our proprietary gateway technology solution to process card-based payments. However, as more of these gateway-only merchants choose to also adopt our end-to-end payment solutions, our revenue per merchant and merchant retention are expected to increase given the fees we generate on end-to-end payment processing services are significantly higher than the per transaction fees we earn on gateway-only services.
Mix of our merchant base. We continue to experience a shift to higher average revenue and higher average volume per merchant. The revenue and volume contribution of each merchant within our portfolio is affected by several factors, including the amount of payment volume processed per merchant, the industry vertical in which the merchant operates, and the number of solutions implemented by the merchant. The size and sophistication of our average merchant continues to increase and we may experience shifts in the average revenue per merchant and the weighted average pricing of the portfolio.
Ability to attract and retain software partners. A key pillar of our Shift4 Model is our partner-centric distribution approach. We work with our software partners who rely on our suite of payment-related technology solutions to simplify the commerce needs of their end clients. Our ability to attract and retain our software partners is essential for our future growth and our ability to service our existing base of merchants. To this end, it is critical we maintain our product leadership through continued investment in innovative technology solutions as a means to ensure we retain our current software partners while attracting new software partners.
Investment in product, distribution and operations. We make significant investments in both new product development and existing product enhancements, such as mobile point-of-sale, cloud enablement for our software partners’ existing systems, and contactless payments, including QR code based mobile payment technologies. New product features and functionality are brought to market through varied distribution and promotional activities including collaborative efforts with industry leading software providers, trade shows, and customer conferences. Further, we will continue to invest in operational support in order to maintain service levels expected by our merchant customers. We believe these investments in product development and software integrations will lead to long-term growth and profitability.
Pursuit of strategic acquisitions. From time to time, we may pursue acquisitions as part of our ongoing growth strategy that includes adding complementary technology capabilities to service our base of customer and adding critical sales and support capabilities within a specific industry vertical or geography. While these acquisitions are intended to add long-term value, in the short term they may add redundant operating expenses or additional carrying costs until the underlying value is unlocked.
Economic conditions and resulting consumer spending trends. Changes in macro-level consumer spending trends, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect the amount of volumes processed on our platform, thus resulting in fluctuations in our quarterly reported revenue. Our quarterly revenue is also impacted by seasonal, consumer spending habit patterns, which historically have resulted in higher volumes and revenue being reported in our second and third fiscal quarters.
Key financial definitions
The following briefly describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Gross revenue consists primarily of payments-based revenue and subscription and other revenues:
Payments-based revenue includes fees for payment processing services and gateway services. Payment processing fees are primarily driven as a percentage of end-to-end payment volume. They may also have a fixed fee, a minimum monthly usage fee and a fee based on transactions. Gateway services, data encryption and tokenization fees are primarily driven by per transaction fees as well as monthly usage fees. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2021 includes nonrecurring payments of $23.1 million we made to our merchants related to the TSYS outage, described in Recent Developments above, that are treated as contra revenue and as such reduce payments-based revenue.
Subscription and other revenues include SaaS fees for point-of-sale systems and terminals provided to merchants and our Shift4Shop eCommerce platform. Point-of-sale and terminal SaaS fees are assessed based on the type and quantity of equipment deployed to the merchant. Shift4Shop SaaS fees are based on the eCommerce platform chosen by the merchant. SaaS fees also include statement fees, fees for our proprietary business intelligence software, annual fees, regulatory compliance fees and other miscellaneous services such as help desk support and warranties on equipment. Subscription and other revenues also includes revenue derived from software license sales, hardware sales, third party residuals, and fees charged for technology support.
Cost of sales consists of interchange and processing fees, residual commissions, equipment and other costs of sales:
Interchange and processing fees represent payments to card issuing banks and assessments paid to card associations based on transaction processing volume. These also include fees incurred by third-parties for data transmission and settlement of funds, such as processors and sponsor banks.
Residual commissions represent monthly payments to third-party resellers, including software partners (ISVs). These costs are typically based on a percentage of payment-based revenue.
Equipment represents our costs of devices that are purchased by the merchant.
Other costs of sales includes amortization of capitalized software development costs, capitalized software, acquired technology and capitalized customer acquisition costs. It also includes incentives, shipping and handling costs related to the delivery of devices, and through June 30, 2020, contained other contract fulfillment costs as well as equipment provided under our warranty program that is included with the monthly SaaS fee. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, other contract fulfillment costs and equipment under our warranty program included with the monthly SaaS fee were capitalized as equipment for lease. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method on a product-by-product basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalized software, acquired technology and capitalized acquisition costs are amortized on a straight-line basis in accordance with our accounting policies. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2021 includes nonrecurring payments of $2.8 million we made to our partners related to the TSYS outage described in Recent Developments above.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other expenses associated with corporate management, finance, human resources, shared services, information technology and other activities.
Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization expenses related to merchant relationships, trademarks and trade names, residual commission buyouts, equipment, leasehold improvements, and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. We depreciate and amortize our assets on a straight-line basis in accordance with our accounting policies. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the estimated life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining lease term. Maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from two years to twenty years.
Professional fees consists of costs incurred for accounting, tax, legal, and consulting services.
Advertising and marketing expenses relate to costs incurred to participate in industry tradeshows and dealer conferences, advertising initiatives to build brand awareness, and expenses to fulfill loyalty program rewards earned by software partners.
Restructuring expenses relate to strategic initiatives we have taken that include, but are not limited to, severance or separation costs and other exit and disposal costs. These expenses are typically not reflective of our ongoing operations.
Transaction-related expenses relate to costs that are not capitalizable associated with issuing the 2026 Senior Notes. These expenses are typically not reflective of our ongoing operations.
Other operating (income) expense, net consists of other operating items.
Loss on extinguishment of debt represents losses recorded for unamortized capitalized financing costs associated with debt prepayments.
Other income, net primarily consists of other non-operating items.
Interest expense consists of interest costs incurred on our borrowings and amortization of capitalized financing costs.
Income tax benefit (provision) represents federal, state and local taxes based on income in multiple domestic jurisdictions.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests arises from net loss from the non-owned portion of businesses where we have a controlling interest but less than 100% ownership. This represents the noncontrolling interests in Shift4 Payments, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, which is comprised of the loss allocated to Continuing Equity Owners as a result of their proportional ownership of LLC Interests.
Comparison of results for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented.
(a)Includes the net loss for the period January 1, 2020 through June 4, 2020, the date the SEC declared effective the Company’s Registration Statement on S-1 filed in connection with its IPO. See Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $23.1 million of nonrecurring payments we made to our merchants and $2.8 million of non-recurring payments we made to our partners due to the TSYS outage. An additional $0.4 million of associated costs were incurred as a result of the outage. The TSYS outage payments and associated costs had the following impact on our results in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021:
•$23.1 million decrease to Payments-based revenue and Gross revenue;
•$2.8 million increase to Other costs of sales;
•$26.1 million decrease to Gross profit; and
•$26.3 million decrease to Loss from operations and Net loss.
See Recent developments above and Note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the TSYS outage.
Gross Revenue
Gross revenue was $1,367.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $766.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $600.6 million or 78.3%. Gross revenue is comprised of payments-based revenue and subscription and other revenues. The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $23.1 million in payments we made to merchants as a result of the August 2021 TSYS outage discussed in Recent developments above, which were recorded as contra revenue.
Payments-based revenue was $1,258.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $684.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $573.8 million or 83.9%. The increase in payments-based revenue is primarily driven by an increase in end-to-end payment volume of $22.4 billion, or approximately 92%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our end-to-end payment volumes beginning mid-March 2020 when shelter-in-place, social distancing, the closing of non-essential businesses and other restrictive measures were first put in place across the United States. This was partially offset by $23.1 million in payments we made to merchants as a result of the August 2021 TSYS outage discussed in Recent developments above.
Subscription and other revenues were $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $26.8 million or 32.4%. The increase in subscription and other revenues was driven primarily by the 3dcart, VenueNext, Hospitality Technology Vendor and Postec acquisitions, which collectively contributed $29.9 million more to subscription and other revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in hardware revenue of $2.9 million primarily due to hardware provided under our SaaS arrangements being accounted for as operating leases in the year ended December 31, 2021, whereby revenue is recognized monthly, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which for the period January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, was recognized at the time of shipment.
Network Fees
Network fees were $861.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $443.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $417.9 million or 94.1%. This increase is correlated with the increase in end-to-end payment volume as described above.
Gross revenue less network fees was $529.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $323.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $206.0 million or 63.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross revenue less network fees excludes the $23.1 million impact of the TSYS outage to gross revenue. The increase in gross revenue less network fees is largely correlated with the increase in end-to-end payment volume. See “Key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures” for a reconciliation of gross profit to gross revenue less network fees.
Other costs of sales
Other costs of sales was $227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $145.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $82.1 million, or 56.5%. This increase was primarily a result of:
•higher residual commissions, which increased other costs of sales $55.9 million, driven by the growth in gross revenue less network fees;
•the 3dcart, VenueNext, Hospitality Technology Vendor, and Postec acquisitions, which collectively increased other costs of sales $15.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020;
•higher capitalized acquisition cost amortization, which increased other costs of sales $5.8 million, related to deal bonuses paid to VARs to obtain processing contracts;
•higher than normal chargeback losses in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 driven by the business failure of one merchant causing $5.5 million in estimated unrecoverable chargeback transactions in the year ended December 31, 2021;
•payments to partners of $2.8 million, which increased other costs of sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the TSYS outage discussed in Recent developments above; and
•higher capitalized software development amortization, which increased other costs of sales $2.5 million; partially offset by,
•the impact of modifying the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements and updating our operational procedures to account for our hardware as operating leases, which resulted in a decline of $12.5 million in costs of sales. Effective June 30, 2020, equipment leased to merchants is capitalized as a fixed asset, whereas, prior to June 30, 2020, these arrangements were accounted for as sales-type leases and expensed when deployed.
Operating expenses
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $219.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $180.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $39.5 million or 21.9%. The increase was due to higher employee-related expenses of $30.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of our continued growth and expansion. In addition, the recent acquisitions of 3dcart, VenueNext, Hospitality Technology Vendor and Postec collectively increased general and administrative expenses $20.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Also contributing to the increase were non-cash adjustments for contingent liability valuations of $5.9 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense of $26.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of compensation expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to contractual change of control bonuses in connection with the IPO. See Note 21 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on equity-based compensation.
Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense was $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10.3 million or 19.8%. The increase was primarily due to hardware provided under our SaaS arrangements being accounted for as operating leases, effective June 30, 2020, while previously they were accounted for as sales-type leases driving higher depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, of $12.0 million. See Note 4 and Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the change to the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements. In addition, the recent acquisitions of 3dcart, VenueNext, Hospitality Technology Vendor and Postec collectively increased depreciation and amortization expense $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by a decline in intangible amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as certain intangible assets reached the end of their amortization period.
Professional fees. Professional fees were $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.1 million or 57.0%. The increase was due to acquisition-related costs and increased fees related to requirements of operating as a public company.
Advertising and marketing. Advertising and marketing expenses were $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $24.9 million. The increase was primarily due to expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the integration of 3dcart and its rebranding as Shift4Shop and $3.7 million of costs associated with the Inspiration4 seat. These expenses are anticipated to be nonrecurring in nature.
Transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These represent financing fees incurred for the debt refinancing in October 2020, which was accounted for as a debt modification.
Other operating (income) expense, net
Other operating (income) expense, net includes the impact of modifying the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements and updating our operational procedures. As a result, beginning June 30, 2020, hardware provided under our SaaS agreements is accounted for as an operating lease, whereas prior to June 30, 2020, these arrangements were accounted for as sales-type leases. An adjustment of $12.4 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2020 to reflect the impact of the lease modifications.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
A loss on extinguishment of debt, representing unamortized capitalized financing costs, of $0.2 million was incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.6 million comprised of $7.1 million in connection with the pre-payment of $59.8 million on the First Lien Term Loan Facility and the full repayment of $130.0 million on the Second Lien Term Loan Facility, representing the unamortized capitalized financing costs associated with the repayment, and $9.5 million associated with the debt refinancing in October 2020. See Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Other income, net
Other income, net was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.6 million for year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.3 million or 50.0%. The decrease is primarily driven by unearned contingent liabilities associated with our residual commission buyout agreements in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest expense
Interest expense was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $12.2 million or 30.3%. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the pre-payments for the First Lien and Second Lien Term Loan Facilities, as well as the repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility, all of which were completed in June 2020, and impacted interest expense by approximately $9.2 million. In addition, the debt refinancing in October 2020 reduced the interest rate on our First Lien Term Loan Facility from 5.50% to 4.625% on the 2026 Senior Notes, which reduced interest expense by $4.8 million. The interest rate of 0.50% on the 2027 Convertible Notes that were issued in July 2021 resulted in $1.4 million of additional interest expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
Income tax benefit
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 4.0%, compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 2.1%.
The 2021 income tax benefit was different than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the loss allocated to the noncontrolling interest, changes in the valuation allowances in the United States and the tax windfall related the vested equity-based compensation awards. The 2020 income tax benefit was different than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the loss allocated to the noncontrolling interest, changes in the valuation allowances in the United States and recording a tax benefit of $0.6 million for a net operating loss carryback at Shift4 Corporation which was allowed due to the CARES Act.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of Shift4 Payments, LLC was $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $67.2 million or 72.3%. The net loss incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the net loss incurred prior to the Reorganization Transactions and prior to June 4, 2020, the date the SEC declared effective our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed in connection with our IPO.
Comparison of results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented.
(a)Includes the net loss for the period January 1, 2020 through June 4, 2020, the date the SEC declared effective the Company’s Registration Statement on S-1 filed in connection with its IPO. See Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Gross Revenue
Gross revenue was $766.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $731.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $35.5 million or 4.9%. Gross revenue is comprised of payments-based revenue and subscription and other revenues.
Payments-based revenue was $684.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $643.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $40.6 million or 6.3%. The increase in payments-based revenue is primarily driven by an increase in end-to-end payment volume of $2.2 billion, or 9.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our end-to-end payment volumes beginning mid-March 2020 when shelter-in-place, social distancing, the closing of non-essential businesses and other restrictive measures were first put in place across the United States. Since late March 2020, we have seen a significant recovery in our end-to-end payment volumes, including growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the prior year. In addition, the Merchant Link Acquisition in August 2019 contributed an additional $7.0 million in gateway service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Subscription and other revenues were $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $87.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $5.1 million or 5.8%. The decrease was due to hardware provided under our SaaS arrangements being accounted for as operating leases, effective June 30, 2020, whereby revenue is recognized monthly, resulting in lower hardware revenue of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, when it was recognized at the time of shipment. In addition, customer billing revenue declined $4.7 million primarily due to temporary fee waivers of $1.9 million on certain products from March 2020 through June 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a decline in hardware revenue and software license sales of $2.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by the Merchant Link Acquisition in August 2019, which contributed $5.2 million more to subscription and other revenues in year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Network Fees
Network fees were $443.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $425.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $18.0 million or 4.2%. This increase is correlated with the increase in end-to-end payment volume as described above.
Gross revenue less network fees was $323.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $305.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $17.5 million or 5.7%. The increase in gross revenue less network fees is largely correlated with the increase in end-to-end payment volume. See “Key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures” for a reconciliation of gross profit to gross revenue less network fees.
Other costs of sales
Other costs of sales was $145.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $132.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.1 million, or 9.9%. This increase was primarily a result of:
•an increase in higher residual commissions of $8.6 million driven by gross revenue less network fees;
•the Merchant Link Acquisition in August 2019, which contributed $6.0 million more to other costs of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019;
•higher capitalized acquisition cost amortization of $5.5 million related to deal bonuses;
•higher capitalized software development amortization of $1.7 million; partially offset by,
•the impact of modifying the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements and updating our operational procedures to account for our hardware as operating leases, which resulted in a decline of $9.1 million in costs of sales. Effective June 30, 2020, equipment leased to merchants is capitalized as a fixed asset, whereas, prior to June 30, 2020, these arrangements were accounted for as sales-type leases and expensed when deployed.
Operating expenses
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $180.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $62.9 million or 53.7% The increase was primarily due to equity-based compensation expense of $66.2 million, partially offset by $21.6 million in non-cash adjustments for contingent liability valuations and deferred compensation arrangements. See Note 21 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on equity-based compensation and Note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on these contingent liabilities. In addition, general and administrative expenses increased $11.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the Merchant Link Acquisition in August 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense was $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $11.7 million or 29.1%. The increase was primarily due to hardware provided under our SaaS arrangements being accounted for as operating leases, effective June 30, 2020, while previously they were accounted for as sales-type leases. Depreciation expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to these operating leases were $9.8 million. See Note 4 and Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the change to the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements.
Professional fees. Professional fees were $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.3 million or 2.9%. The increase was due to increased fees related to public company requirements and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher professional fees incurred in 2019 resulting from costs associated with activities to prepare for the IPO.
Advertising and marketing. Advertising and marketing expenses were $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.3 million or 36.5% The decrease was primarily due to postponing or cancelling trade shows in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Restructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses were $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.4 million or 89.5%. The decrease in restructuring expenses is a result of separation costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019 associated with the integration of the Merchant Link Acquisition in August 2019. See Note 5 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on restructuring expenses.
Transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These represent financing fees incurred for the debt refinancing in October 2020, which was accounted for as a debt modification.
Other operating (income) expense, net
Other operating (income) expense, net includes the impact of modifying the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements and updating our operational procedures. As a result, beginning June 30, 2020, hardware provided under our SaaS agreements is accounted for as an operating lease, whereas prior to June 30, 2020, these arrangements were accounted for as sales-type leases. An adjustment of $12.4 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2020 to reflect the impact of the lease modifications.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
A loss on extinguishment of debt, representing unamortized capitalized financing costs, was incurred of $16.6 million comprised of $7.1 million in connection with the pre-payment on the First Lien Term Loan Facility and the full repayment on the Second Lien Term Loan Facility in June 2020 and $9.5 million associated with the debt refinancing in October 2020. See Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Other income, net
Other income, net was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.0 million for year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.4 million or 40.0%. The decrease is primarily driven by unearned contingent liabilities associated with our residual commission buyout agreements.
Interest expense
Interest expense was $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $11.3 million or 21.9%. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the pre-payments for the First Lien and Second Lien Term Loan Facilities, as well as the repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility, in June 2020, which impacted interest expense by approximately $11.0 million. In addition, the debt refinancing in October 2020 reduced the interest rate on our First Lien Term Loan Facility from 5.50% to 4.625% on the 2026 Senior Notes, which reduced interest expense by $1.3 million. This was partially offset by the amortization of the debt discount on the 2025 Convertible Notes of $1.9 million, additional borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan Facility from refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness in October 2019 and additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility during 2020 prior to the pre-payments.
Income tax provision
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.1%, compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 of (3.1)%.
The 2020 income tax benefit was different than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the loss allocated to the noncontrolling interest, changes in the valuation allowances in the U.S. and recording a tax benefit of $0.6 million for a net operating loss carryback at Shift4 Corporation which was allowed due to the CARES Act. The 2019 income tax expense was different than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to Shift4 Payments, LLC being treated as a partnership and not paying income tax. The change in the effective tax rate between the periods was primarily a result of a mix of earnings between entities, the 2020 net operating loss carryback due to the CARES Act and the change in the noncontrolling interest and valuation allowance adjustment.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of Shift4 Payments, LLC was $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of Shift4 Payments, LLC for the years ended December 31, 2019
Key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures
The following table sets forth our key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures for the periods presented.
End-to-end payment volume
End-to-end payment volume is defined as the total dollar amount of card payments that we authorize and settle on behalf of our merchants. This volume does not include volume processed through our gateway-only merchants.
Gross revenue less network fees, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
We use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include: gross revenue less network fees, which includes interchange and assessment fees; earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”); and Adjusted EBITDA. Gross revenue less network fees represents a key performance metric that management uses to measure changes in the mix and value derived from our customer base as we continue to execute our strategy to expand our reach to serve larger, complex merchants. For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross revenue less network fees excludes the impact of the payments to merchants, included in “Gross revenue,” and payments to partners and associated expenses due to the TSYS outage, included in “Cost of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These are nonrecurring payments that occurred outside of our day-to-day operations, and we have excluded them in order to provide more useful information to investors in the evaluation of our performance period-over-period. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate its business and monitor results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA further adjusted for certain non-cash and other nonrecurring items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. These adjustments include acquisition, restructuring and integration costs, equity-based compensation expense and other nonrecurring items. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities is often large relative to the Company's overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of our operating results and investors' ability to analyze the business from period to period.
We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of gross revenue less network fees, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items.
Reconciliations of gross revenue less network fees, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
The tables below provide reconciliations of gross profit to gross revenue less network fees and net loss on a consolidated basis for the periods presented to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
Gross revenue less network fees:
(a)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $2.8 million of nonrecurring payments to partners associated with the TSYS outage. See Recent developments above and Note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the TSYS outage.
(b)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $23.1 million of nonrecurring payments to merchants associated with the TSYS outage and associated expenses of $0.2 million. See Recent developments above and Note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the TSYS outage.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:
(a)Includes nonrecurring payments we made in the year ended December 31, 2021 to our merchants of $23.1 million and partners of $2.8 million due to the TSYS outage and other expenses incurred associated with the TSYS outage of $0.4 million. See Recent developments above and Note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the TSYS outage.
(b)For the year ended December 31, 2021, consists primarily of expenses related to the integration of 3dcart and its rebranding as Shift4Shop of $20.8 million, acquisition-related costs incurred of $7.3 million, $3.7 million of costs associated with the Inspiration4 seat and $1.6 million of severance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, consists primarily of transaction expenses incurred related to the two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $2.1 million, change of control liabilities as a result of the IPO of $3.8 million, deferred compensation arrangements of $2.1 million, severance costs of $1.2 million, restructuring expenses of $0.4 million and transaction expenses of $0.8 million related to the October 2020 debt refinancing, partially offset by fair value adjustments to contingent liabilities of $8.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, consists primarily of adjustments to contingent liabilities of $15.5 million, one-time professional fees of $6.7 million, restructuring expenses of $3.8 million, and deferred compensation arrangements of $0.9 million. See Note 5 and Note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the restructuring expenses and contingent liability adjustments, respectively.
(c)Represents equity-based compensation expense for RSUs, including employer taxes for vested RSUs. See Note 21 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on equity-based compensation.
(d)Effective June 30, 2020, we modified the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements and updated operational procedures. As a result, beginning June 30, 2020, hardware provided under our SaaS agreements is accounted for as an operating lease, whereas prior to June 30, 2020, these arrangements were accounted for as sales-type leases. This adjustment of $12.4 million represents the one-time cumulative impact of modifying the contracts effective June 30, 2020. Prior to amending the terms, the sales-type lease accounting treatment impacted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA negatively by $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
(e)For the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consists of a $16.6 million in losses on the extinguishment of debt associated with the debt pre-payments in 2020 and $1.6 million for temporary fee waivers given on certain products from March 2020 through June 2020 as a result of COVID-19. See Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the losses on the extinguishment of debt. Also includes fees to the Continuing Equity Owners for consulting and managing services through the date of the IPO of $0.8 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are not required to be paid subsequent to the IPO. See Note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about these related party transactions.
Liquidity and capital resources
Overview
We have historically sourced our liquidity requirements primarily with cash flow from operations and, when needed, with borrowings under our Credit Facilities or equity transactions. The principal uses for liquidity have been debt service, capital expenditures (including research and development) and funds required to finance acquisitions. Given the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the restaurant and hospitality industries, we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure we can continue to operate during these uncertain times.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Shift4 Payments, Inc. is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, Shift4 Payments, Inc.’s ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from Shift4 Payments, LLC. The amounts available to Shift4 Payments, Inc. to pay cash dividends are subject to the covenants and distribution restrictions in its subsidiaries’ agreements governing its indebtedness, including covenants in such agreements providing that the payments of dividends or other distributions are subject to annual limitations based on our market capitalization.
The following table sets forth summary cash flow information for the periods presented.
(a)Effective June 30, 2020, we modified the terms and conditions of our SaaS arrangements and updated our operational procedures. As a result, hardware provided to our merchants is accounted for as an operating lease, whereby the cost of the equipment is included in investing activities when purchased and the depreciation of the equipment under lease is included in operating activities. Prior to June 30, 2020, this hardware was treated as a sales-type lease, in which the hardware was expensed when shipped and included in operating activities. To provide comparability, if this equipment had been accounted for as an operating lease for the period January 1, 2020 through June 29, 2020, net cash provided by operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2020 would be higher by $9.3 million, with a corresponding decrease to investing activities. If this equipment had been accounted for as an operating lease for the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 would be higher by $13.7 million, with a corresponding decrease to investing activities.
Operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in other assets and liabilities.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities of $29.2 million is primarily a result of:
•net loss of $74.0 million, which includes $25.8 million of nonrecurring payments to our merchants and partners due to the TSYS outage and associated costs incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, adjusted for non-cash expenses, including depreciation and amortization of $104.4 million, equity-based compensation of $40.8 million, provision for bad debts of $11.3 million; plus,
•changes in operating assets and liabilities of $57.8 million, which is primarily a result of $37.8 million of funds deposited in our sponsor bank merchant settlement account to facilitate gross card transaction deposits for those customers we bill on a monthly, versus a daily basis, and $20.9 million of interest payments on outstanding debt, offset by working capital fluctuations.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities of $23.4 million is primarily a result of:
•net loss of $111.4 million adjusted for non-cash expenses, including equity-based compensation of $66.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $84.2 million, cumulative impact of modifying our lease contracts of $(12.4) million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.6 million, revaluation of contingent liabilities of $(6.1) million, provision for bad debts of $7.7 million and amortization of capitalized financing costs and debt discount of $5.4 million; plus,
•changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(26.0) million, which is primarily a result of $15.5 million of funds deposited in our sponsor bank merchant settlement account to facilitate gross card transaction deposits for those customers we bill on a monthly, versus a daily basis, and a $5.6 million reduction in interest payable on our long-term debt at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities of $26.7 million is primarily a result of:

•the acquisition of VenueNext Inc. in March 2021 for $68.5 million in aggregate purchase consideration, including $40.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $1.6 million;
•higher purchases for equipment to be leased of $31.4 million;
•investments in non-marketable securities of $30.5 million, including investments in SpaceX of $27.5 million;
•the acquisition of Postec Inc. in September 2021 for $14.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $1.4 million;
•higher capitalized software development costs of $11.3 million;

•the acquisition of a Hospitality Technology Vendor in October 2020 for $10.5 million, net of cash acquired of $0.6 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $98.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily the result of:
•the acquisition of 3dcart in November 2020 for $40.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.3 million; plus,
•the acquisition of a Hospitality Technology Vendor in October 2020 for $10.5 million, net of cash acquired of $0.6 million; and
•$14.5 million in purchases for equipment to be leased; partially offset by
•the acquisition of Merchant Link in August 2019 for $64.0 million, net of cash acquired of $3.8 million.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $471.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $531.6 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,002.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily a result of:
•the IPO, concurrent private placement and September Follow-on Offering net proceeds of approximately $557.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs paid in the year ended December 31, 2020;
•the net proceeds from the 2025 Convertible Notes of $673.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020;
•the net proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes of $442.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020;

Convertible Notes, Senior Notes and Credit Facilities
As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,772.5 million total principal amount of debt outstanding, including $690.0 million of 2025 Convertible Notes, $632.5 million of 2027 Convertible Notes and $450.0 million of 2026 Senior Notes.
Convertible Notes Offering - 2027 Notes
In July 2021, Shift4 Payments, Inc. issued an aggregate principal amount of $632.5 million of 2027 Convertible Notes to qualified institutional buyers in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. We received net proceeds, after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $617.7 million from the offering of the 2027 Convertible Notes. The net proceeds of the 2027 Convertible Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, will be used for general corporate purposes. The 2027 Convertible Notes will mature on August 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest on the 2027 Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 1 and August 1, commencing on February 1, 2022. We will settle conversions by paying in cash up to the principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes with any excess to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, in cash or shares of Class A common stock or a combination of both at our election, based on the conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 8.1524 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $122.66 per share of Class A common stock), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. None of the specified events for the conversion of the 2027 Convertible Notes occurred as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Convertible Notes Offering - 2025 Notes
In December 2020, Shift4 Payments, Inc. issued an aggregate principal amount of $690.0 million of 2025 Convertible Notes, to qualified institutional buyers in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. We received net proceeds, after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $673.6 million from the 2025 Convertible Notes Offering. The net proceeds of the 2025 Convertible Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, will be used for general corporate purposes. The 2025 Convertible Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes does not accrete and will mature on December 15, 2025 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The initial conversion rate is 12.4262 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.48 per share of Class A common stock), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. None of the specified events for the conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes occurred as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Senior Notes Offering - 2026 Notes
In October 2020, Shift4 Payments, LLC and Shift4 Payments Finance Sub, Inc., or the Issuers, issued an aggregate $450.0 million principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes. We received net proceeds, after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $442.8 million from the offering of the 2026 Senior Notes. The net proceeds of the 2026 Senior Notes offering, together with cash on hand, were used to repay all indebtedness outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan Facility. The 2026 Senior Notes mature on November 1, 2026, and accrue interest at a rate of 4.625% per year. Interest on the 2026 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 1, and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2021. The Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the 2026 Senior Notes at any time prior to November 1, 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium as provided in the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after November 1, 2022, the Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the 2026 Senior Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time prior to November 1, 2022, the Issuers may also redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes (including any additional 2026 Senior Notes) with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any to the redemption date. The Issuers may make such redemption so long as, after giving effect to any such redemption, at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes (including any additional 2026 Senior Notes) remains outstanding (unless all 2026 Senior Notes are redeemed concurrently) and such redemption occurs within 90 days of the closing of the applicable equity offering. See Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Revolving Credit Facility
In October 2020, we fully repaid the $650.0 million of aggregate principal amount of secured term loans comprised of first lien term loans of $520.0 million due November 30, 2024 (“First Lien Term Loan Facility”), using the proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes. The credit agreement governing the First Lien Term Loan Facility (“First Lien Credit Agreement”) included a revolving credit facility that had a borrowing capacity of $90.0 million (“Revolving Credit Facility”), which previously matured on November 30, 2022.
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility
In January 2021, Shift4 Payments, LLC amended and restated its First Lien Credit Agreement (“the Amended Credit Agreement”) and increased the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility to $100.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on January 29, 2026 or, if greater than $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes remains outstanding on September 15, 2025, on that date. The Amended Credit Facility requires periodic interest payments until maturity.
Loans incurred under the amended Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either the LIBO rate plus a margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% per year or the alternate base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or the prime rate announced from time to time in The Wall Street Journal) plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% per year (“Applicable Rate”). The Applicable Rate varies depending on our total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The alternate base rate and the LIBO rate are each subject to a zero percent floor. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate ranging from 0.25% per year to 0.50% per year, in each case based on the total leverage ratio. We are also subject to customary letter of credit and agency fees. The Revolving Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of $99.5 million, net of a $0.5 million letter of credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Stock Repurchases
On December 16, 2021, our board of directors authorized commencement of a stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”) and will expire on December 31, 2022.
Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization.
This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Common Stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.
As of December 31, 2021, we repurchased 378,475 shares of Common stock for $21.1 million, including commissions paid, at an average price paid of $55.81 per share, which is recorded as “Treasury stock” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $78.9 million remained available for future purchases under the program.
In January 2022, we repurchased 245,700 shares of Common stock for $13.9 million, including commissions paid, at an average price paid of $56.48 per share.
Cash requirements
Our material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.
Debt
As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,772.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding with maturities beginning in 2025. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $123.1 million with $24.0 million payable within twelve months.
Leases
As of December 31, 2021, we are obligated under non-cancellable operating leases for our premises, which expire through November 2030. Rent expense incurred under operating leases, which totaled $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, is included in “General and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statements of operations.
Critical accounting policies
Our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods described is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these historical financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, we have made accounting estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of our contingent liabilities, other intangible assets and goodwill based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The following critical accounting discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our historical financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.
Revenue recognition
Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction or an agent can require considerable judgment. We have concluded that we are the principal in our payment processing arrangements as we control the service on our payments platform, which is transformative in nature and allows for front-end and back-end risk mitigation, merchant portability, third party software integrations, and enhanced reporting functionality. We also contract directly with our merchants and have complete pricing latitude on the processing fees charged to our merchants. As such, we bear the credit risk for network fees and transactions charged back to the merchant. For our SaaS arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is based on the fair value of each product and service. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.
Business combinations
Upon acquisition of a company, we determine if the transaction is a business combination, which is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at fair value. We use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. One of the most significant estimates relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities. The determination of the fair values is based on estimates and judgments made by management. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Measurement period adjustments are reflected at the time identified, up through the conclusion of the measurement period, which is the time at which all information for determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received, and is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. We may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
Additionally, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions periodically and record any adjustments to preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided we are within the measurement period. If outside of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statement of operations.
Goodwill and intangible assets
We perform a goodwill impairment test annually at October 1 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. We have determined that our business comprises one reporting unit. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, in which case a quantitative impairment test is not required.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. We monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period. We test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an asset’s useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset’s useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset.
Tax receivable agreement
We entered into a TRA with Shift4 Payments, LLC, each of the Continuing Equity Owners and each of the Blocker Shareholders that will provide for the payment by Shift4 Payments, Inc. to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits, if any, that Shift4 Payments Inc. actually realizes or in some circumstances is deemed to realize in its tax reporting, as a result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of Shift4 Payments, LLC resulting from any redemptions of LLC Interests from the Continuing Equity Owners, (2) our utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies and (3) certain other tax benefits related to making our payments under the TRA.
In addition to tax expenses, we will also make payments under the TRA, which we expect to be significant. We will account for the income tax effects and corresponding TRA’s effects resulting from future taxable purchases or redemptions of LLC Interests of the Continuing LLC Owners by us or Shift4 Payments, LLC or the Blocker Shareholders by recognizing an increase in our deferred tax assets, based on enacted tax rates at the date of the purchase or redemption. Further, we will evaluate the likelihood that we will realize the benefit represented by the deferred tax asset and, to the extent that we estimate that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit, we will reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance. The amounts to be recorded for both the deferred tax assets and the liability for our obligations under the TRA will be estimated at the time of any purchase or redemption as a reduction to shareholders’ equity, and the effects of changes in any of our estimates after this date will be included in net income (loss). Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income (loss). Judgement is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in Shift4 Payments, Inc.’s financial statements. A change in our assessment of such consequences, such as realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof could materially impact our results. As we currently do not generate taxable income, the consolidated financial statements assume that no payments under the TRA will be made.
Noncontrolling Interests
After the Reorganization Transactions, we are the sole managing member of Shift4 Payments, LLC. We have the majority of the voting interest in and control the management of Shift4 Payments, LLC. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Shift4 Payments, LLC and report a noncontrolling interest related to the interests in Shift4 Payments, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners on our consolidated balance sheet.
New accounting pronouncements
For information regarding new accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
JOBS Act
Prior to December 31, 2021, we were an EGC as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We had elected to avail ourselves of this exemption prior to December 31, 2021, when we were an EGC, and as a result, our financial statements prior to that date may not have been comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. As of December 31, 2021, we are no longer an EGC.
Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC we also were able to rely on certain of the exemptions and reduced reporting requirements of the JOBS Act, including without limitation, from providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and from complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. Because we no longer qualify as an EGC, we are no longer able to take advantage of the extended transition period for the adoption of certain accounting standards or of the reduced disclosure and other benefits available to EGCs, including our exemption from providing our auditor’s attestation on our system of internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
