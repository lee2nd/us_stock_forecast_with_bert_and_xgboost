CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.

Assuming the repurchase of the Outstanding Preferred and based upon 2,725,010 shares of GIGA Common Stock currently outstanding, following the issuance to the Company of the shares of GIGA Common Stock and GIGA Preferred Stock pursuant to the Exchange Transaction, the Company would hold approximately 68% of the outstanding voting power and capital stock of GIGA, and existing holders of GIGA Common Stock would hold approximately 32%.

On February 4, 2022, we and our wholly owned subsidiary Ault Alliance entered into a securities purchase agreement providing for our purchase of BNI from Ault Alliance. As a result of this transaction, both BNI and Ault Alliance are each stand-alone wholly owned subsidiaries of ours.
On February 10, 2022, consistent with our objective to have BNI operate the entirety of our business that relates to cryptocurrencies, Ault Alliance assigned the entirety of its interest in ACS to BNI.
On February 25, 2022, we entered into an At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “2022 Sales Agreement”), with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC, acting as the sales agent, relating to the sale of shares of common stock offered by a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.

Promptly following the closing of the Transaction, IMHC will dissolve its three dormant subsidiaries.
Our Corporate Structure
On January 19, 2021, we changed our corporate name from DPW Holdings, Inc. to Ault Global Holdings, Inc. and, on December 13, 2021, we changed our corporate name from Ault Global Holdings, Inc. to BitNile Holdings, Inc. (together, the “Name Changes”). The Name Changes were each effected through a parent/subsidiary short form merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 7, 2021 and December 1, 2021, respectively. Neither of the mergers nor the corresponding Name Change affected the rights of our security holders. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol “NILE.” Existing stock certificates that reflect our prior corporate name continue to be valid. Certificates reflecting the new corporate name are issued as old stock certificates are tendered for exchange or transfer to our transfer agent. Concurrently with the change in our name to Ault Global Holdings, Inc., Milton C. Ault III was appointed as our Executive Chairman, William B. Horne was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and remains as Vice Chairman of our Board, and Henry Nisser was appointed as our President and remains as our General Counsel.
Commencing in October 2019 and continuing through February 2022, we reorganized our corporate structure pursuant to a series of transactions by and among BitNile Holdings and our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries. The purpose of the reorganization was to align our various businesses by the products and services that constitute the majority of each subsidiaries’ revenues. As a result of the foregoing transactions, our streamlined corporate structure is currently as follows:
General
As a holding company, our business strategy is designed to increase stockholder value. Under this strategy, we are focused on managing and financially supporting our existing subsidiaries and partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to stockholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: public offerings, the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize stockholder value. We anticipate returning value to stockholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.
From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our stockholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, sales of their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these (or similar) programs and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our stockholders.
Over the recent past we have provided capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of businesses in defense/aerospace, industrial, telecommunications, medical, crypto-mining, textiles and a select portfolio of commercial hospitality properties. We have provided capital to subsidiaries as well as partner companies in which we have an equity interest or may be actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support.
We are a Delaware corporation with our corporate office located at 11411 Southern Highlands Pkwy, Suite 240, Las Vegas, NV 89141. Our phone number is 949-444-5464 and our website address is www.bitnile.com.
Results of Operations
Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2021 and
The following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Revenues
Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
Our revenues increased by $28.5 million, or 120%, to $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
GWW
GWW revenues increased by $7.4 million, or 40%, to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in GWW revenue in 2021 includes an increase of $6.4 million from Relec, which was acquired on November 30, 2020. In the prior year period, revenue was constrained by a lack of working capital. The increase in revenue from our GWW segment for customized solutions for the military markets reflects our improved liquidity in 2021, as we were able to allocate additional funds to our defense business to improve its ability to fulfill backlog orders. Revenue from Enertec, which largely consists of revenue recognized over time, was $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.7 million, or 17.9%, from $9.3 million in the prior-year period.
TOGI
TOGI revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.3 million declined $70,000, or 1%, from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Ault Alliance
While BNI acquired the Bitcoin mining operation from Ault Alliance on February 10, 2022, for purposes of this Annual Report, such operations are presented as being carried out under the name of Ault Alliance since this section discusses matters occurring during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Revenues from our cryptocurrency mining operations were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to nil for year ended December 31, 2020, as we resumed our cryptocurrency mining operations during the first quarter of 2021. Our decision to resume cryptocurrency mining operations in 2021 was based on several factors, which positively affected the number of active miners we operated, including the market prices of digital currencies, and favorable power costs available at the Facility.
Revenues from our lending and trading activities increased to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is attributable to a significant allocation of capital from our equity financing transactions to our loan and investment portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2021, DP Lending generated significant income from appreciation of investments in marketable securities as well as shares of common stock underlying convertible notes and warrants issued to DP Lending in certain financing transactions. Under its business model, DP Lending also generates revenue through origination fees charged to borrowers and interest generated from each loan.
Based upon the fair value of Alzamend common stock at December 31, 2021, which was $1.90 based on its closing price on such date, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an unrealized loss of $5.6 million related to our investment in Alzamend common stock.
Revenues from our trading activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 included significant net gains on equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. These gains and losses have caused, and will continue to cause, significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
Gross Margins
Gross margins increased to 54.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our gross margins have typically ranged between 33% and 37%, with slight variations depending on the overall composition of our revenue. During 2022, we expect our gross margins will increase significantly from Bitcoin mining, which is expected to have significantly higher gross margins.
Our gross margins of 54.5% recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021, were impacted by the favorable margins from our lending and trading activities. Excluding the effects of margin from our lending and trading activities, our adjusted gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2021, would have been 32.9%, consistent with our historical range.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by $0.2 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses is due to costs incurred at TOGI related to the development of our EV charger products.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses were $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.6 million, or 560%. The increase was the result of increases in personnel costs directly attributed to an increase in sales and marketing personnel, consultants and advertising spending primarily at Ault Alliance related to digital marketing and digital learning initiatives. The increase is also attributable to costs incurred at TOGI to grow our selling and marketing infrastructure related to our EV charger products.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses were $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $24.2 million, or 193%. General and administrative expenses increased from the comparative prior period, mainly due to:
● non-cash stock compensation costs of $7.8 million;
● the accrual of a $5.1 million performance bonus related to realized gains on trading activities during the period;
● general and administrative costs of $1.4 million from Relec, which was acquired on November 30, 2020;
● increased costs related to the Facility, operated by ACS; and
● higher consulting, audit, legal and insurance costs.
Loss From Continuing Operations
We recorded a loss from continuing operations of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in operating results is attributable to the increase in operating expenses, primarily general and administrative expenses partially offset by the increase in revenue and gross margins.
Interest and Other Income
Interest and other income was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $0.4 million gain related to the release of certain escrow funds related to the 2017 acquisition of Enertec.
Impairment of Debt Securities, Net
Debt securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary. We utilize criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reason underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary. The term “other than temporary” is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent. It indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.
Impairment of debt securities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that the decline in value fair value of the warrant derivative securities that we received as a result of our investment in AVLP was other than temporary. We recorded an impairment of debt securities of $9.3 million with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income reducing prior unrealized losses.
Accretion of discount on note receivable, related party was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the significant decline in the value of warrants in AVLP, accretion of the warrant discount was accelerated, resulting in a discount of nil related to warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible promissory note of AVLP as of December 31, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily related to the decrease in our average level of borrowings during the year. The significant borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2021 were made during the month of December 2021.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value of the warrants that were issued during 2021 in a series of debt financings increased by $0.5 million. The fair value of these warrants is re-measured at each financial reporting period and immediately before exercise, with any changes in fair value recorded as change in fair value of warrant liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as principal and accrued interest of $6.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, on our debt securities was satisfied through the issuance of 9.6 million shares of common stock. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of $15.6 million as a result of these issuances. The remaining loss on extinguishment is primarily due to the estimated fair value of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.7 million shares of common stock that were issued to Esousa pursuant to the Master Exchange Agreement.
Net Gain From Discontinued Operations
During the first quarter of 2020, we discontinued the restaurant operations of I.AM. Management determined that the permanent closing of the restaurant operations met the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of the restaurant operations are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and are excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. In November 2020, I.AM filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and we ceded authority for managing the business to the Bankruptcy Court, resulting in the deconsolidation I.AM.

For the foregoing reasons, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $24.2 million compared to a net loss of $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income was $1.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that the decline in value fair value of the warrant derivative securities that we received as a result of our investment in AVLP was other than temporary. We recorded an impairment of debt securities of $9.3 million with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income reducing prior unrealized losses, including $7.8 million of unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, unrealized gains in the warrant derivative securities of AVLP was the primary component of other comprehensive income.

Critical Accounting Policies
Variable Interest Entities
For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the entity and the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity.
We evaluate our business relationships with related parties to identify potential VIEs under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation. We consolidate VIEs in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. Entities are considered to be the primary beneficiary if they have both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the VIE’s performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the VIE that would be significant to the VIE. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entity’s governance, the size of our investment, estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the joint venture, if applicable.
Variable Interest Entity Considerations - Avalanche
We have determined that AVLP is a VIE as it does not have sufficient equity at risk. We do not consolidate AVLP because we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest. To be a primary beneficiary, an entity must have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, among other factors. Although we have made a significant investment in AVLP, we have determined that Philou, which controls AVLP through the voting power conferred by its equity investment and which is deemed to be more closely associated with AVLP, is the primary beneficiary. As a result, AVLP’s financial position and results of operations are not consolidated in our financial position and results of operations.
Equity Investment in Unconsolidated Entity
As of December 31, 2021, our ownership percentage of AVLP was less than 20%. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we made additional advances to AVLP under the existing loan agreement and our consolidated VIE, Ault Alpha, entered into a loan agreement with AVLP totaling $3.6 million. Due to our cumulative lending position to AVLP and the facts and circumstances surrounding the terms of loan agreements, we reevaluated our level of influence over AVLP and determined that the equity ownership in AVLP should be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The basis of our previously held interest in AVLP was remeasured to fair value immediately before adopting the equity method of accounting. Our interest in AVLP as of December 31, 2020 has been presented as an equity investment in an unconsolidated entity, consistent with the current year presentation.
We have invested in AVLP based on the potential global impact of the novel technology of AVLP. AVLP has developed a novel cost effective and environmentally friendly material synthesis technology for textile applications. AVLP’s Multiplex Laser Surface Enhancement is a unique technology that has the ability to treat both natural and synthetic textiles for a wide variety of functionalities, including dyeability and printing enhancements, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, fire retardancy and anti-microbial properties. The use of water, harmful chemicals and energy is significantly reduced in comparison to conventional textile treatment methods.
