ITEM 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The information provided below supplements, but does not form part of, CNX's financial statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the views and beliefs of management, as well as assumptions and estimates made by management. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of various risk factors, including those that may not be in the control of management. For further information on items that could impact future operating performance or financial condition, please see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” CNX does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.
General
COVID-19 Update:
CNX continues to monitor the current and potential impacts of the coronavirus COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it has impacted, and may in the future impact, our operations, financial results, liquidity, contractors, customers, employees and vendors. More information regarding these considerations is located in Item 1A Risk Factors. These and other factors could affect the Company’s operations, earnings and cash flows for any period and could cause such results to not be comparable to those of the same period in previous years. The results presented in this Form 10-K are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
While CNX did not incur significant disruptions to operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CNX is unable to predict the full extent of the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the Company, including our financial position, operating results, liquidity and ability to obtain financing in future reporting periods, due to numerous uncertainties outside the Company’s control.
2021 Highlights:
•Increased proved developed reserves to 5.9 Tcfe, 13.5% higher than 2020.
•Total gas production of 590.2 Bcfe.
•Shale production of 540.4 Bcfe.
•Repurchased $241 million or 18.3 million shares of CNX common stock on the open market.
•Reduced Long-Term Debt by $187 million.
2022 Outlook:
•Our 2022 annual gas production is expected to be approximately 575-605 Bcfe.
•Our 2022 E&P capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $470-$500 million.
Results of Operations:
The following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources includes a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020. A similar discussion and analysis that compares year ended December 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 may be found in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Net Loss Attributable to CNX Resources Shareholders
CNX reported a net loss attributable to CNX Resources shareholders of $499 million, or a loss per diluted share of $2.31, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss attributable to CNX Resources shareholders of $484 million, or a loss per diluted share of $2.43, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Included in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments of $1,094 million. Included in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments of $288 million, a $62 million non-cash impairment charge related to exploration and production properties specific to our Southwestern Pennsylvania (SWPA) CBM asset group (See Note 8 - Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K), and a $473 million non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill (See Note 9 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Prior to the effective time of the Merger on September 28, 2020 (See Note 4 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K), public unitholders held a 46.9% equity interest in CNXM and CNX owned the remaining 53.1% equity interest and following the Merger CNX owns 100% of the equity interests of CNXM. . The earnings of CNXM that were attributed to its common units held by the public prior to the Merger are reflected in Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no changes in our ownership interest in CNXM during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
CNX's management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, and believes that they are useful for investors in analyzing the company. Although these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management believes that these financial measures are useful to an investor in evaluating CNX because these metrics are widely used to evaluate a natural gas company’s operating performance. Sales of Natural Gas, NGL and Oil, including cash settlements excludes the impacts of changes in the fair value of commodity derivative instruments prior to settlement, which are often volatile, and only includes the impact of settled commodity derivative instruments. Sales of Natural Gas, NGL and Oil, including cash settlements also excludes purchased gas revenue and other revenue and operating income, which are not directly related to CNX’s natural gas producing activities. Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Production Costs excludes certain expenses that are not directly related to CNX’s natural gas producing activities and are managed outside our production operations (See Note 21 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). These expenses include, but are not limited to, interest expense, impairment of exploration and production properties, impairment of goodwill, other operating expense and other corporate expenses such as selling, general and administrative costs. We believe that Sales of Natural Gas, NGL and Oil, including cash settlements, Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Production Costs and Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Production Margin (which is derived by subtracting Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Production Costs from Sales of Natural Gas, NGL and Oil, including cash settlements) provide useful information to investors for evaluating period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. These metrics should not be viewed as a substitute for measures of performance that are calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because all companies do not calculate these measures identically, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation
1 Natural Gas, NGL and Oil production costs consists primarily of lease operating expense, production ad valorem and other fees, transportation, gathering and compression and production related depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Selected Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Production Financial Data
The following table presents a summary of our total sales volumes, sales of natural gas, NGL and oil including cash settlements, natural gas, NGL and oil production costs and natural gas, NGL and oil production margin related to our production operations on a total company basis (See Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation above for the reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP):
*NGLs and Oil/Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship of NGL, condensate, and natural gas prices.
**Excluding hedge monetizations.
The 79.1 Bcfe increase in volumes in the period-to period comparison was primarily due to the turn-in-line of new wells throughout 2020 and 2021. Additionally, in 2020 the Company temporarily shut-in new turn-in-line wells as a result of low natural gas and NGL pricing. The increases were offset in part by normal production declines.
Changes in the average costs per Mcfe were primarily related to the following items:
•Production, ad valorem and other fees increased on a per unit basis as a result of increased realized prices on natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as the change in production mix by state as new wells were turned-in-line.
•Transportation, gathering and compression expense increased on a per unit basis primarily due to increased processing costs due to a wetter production mix, and increased firm transportation costs.
•Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased on a per unit basis as a result of low cost reserve additions from development during the 2020 period in SWPA, the addition of proved undeveloped Shale wells in the Central Pennsylvania (CPA), and an impairment recognized in CBM in the 2020 period.
Average Realized Price Reconciliation
The following table presents a breakout of liquids and natural gas sales information and settled derivative information to assist in the understanding of the Company’s natural gas production and sales portfolio and information regarding settled commodity derivatives:
*Excluding gains from hedge monetizations
The increase in gross revenue was primarily the result of the $1.84 per Mcf increase in natural gas prices, when excluding the impact of hedging, the 79.1 Bcfe increase in sales volumes and the $20.16 per Bbl increase in NGL prices. These increases were offset, in part, by the impact of the change in the realized (loss) gain on commodity derivative instruments related to the Company's hedging program.
SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:
SHALE SEGMENT
The Shale segment had earnings before income tax of $774 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to earnings before income tax of $474 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
*NGLs and Oil/Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship of oil, NGLs, condensate, and natural gas prices.
The Shale segment had natural gas, NGLs and oil/condensate revenue of $1,989 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $781 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $1,208 million increase was due primarily to a 17.9% increase in total Shale gas sales volumes, and a 13.5% increase in the total average Shale sales price.
The increase in total Shale gas sales volumes was primarily due to the turn-in-line of new wells throughout 2020 and 2021. The increase was also due to the temporary shut-in of new turn-in-line wells in 2020 due to low natural gas prices, offset in part by normal production declines.
The increase in total average Shale sales price was primarily due to a $1.86 per Mcf increase in average gas sales price and a $3.36 per Mcfe increase in the average NGL sales price. These increases were offset in part by a $1.77 per Mcf change in the realized (loss) gain on commodity derivative instruments. The notional amounts associated with these financial hedges represented approximately 429.4 Bcf of the Company's produced Shale gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021 at an average loss of $1.15 per Mcf hedged. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these financial hedges represented approximately 412.1 Bcf at an average gain of $0.82 per Mcf hedged.
Total operating costs and expenses for the Shale segment were $804 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $709 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total dollars and decrease in unit costs for the Shale segment were due to the following items:
•Shale lease operating expenses were $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total dollars was primarily related to an increase in production volumes.
•Shale production, ad valorem and other fees were $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increases in total dollars and unit costs were primarily due to increased realized prices on natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as the change in production mix by state as new wells were turned-in-line.
•Shale transportation, gathering and compression costs were $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total dollars was primarily related to the increase in total production volumes and increased processing costs due to a wetter production mix. The increase in unit costs was primarily due to increased processing costs due to a wetter production mix and an increase in firm transportation costs.
•Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs attributable to the Shale segment were $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $416 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total dollars was due to the increase in production volumes. These amounts included depletion on a unit of production basis of $0.71 per Mcfe and $0.81 per Mcfe, respectively. The decrease in the units of production depreciation, depletion and amortization rate in the current period is primarily the result of low-cost reserve additions from development in 2020 in SWPA as well as the addition of proved undeveloped Shale reserves in CPA. The remaining depreciation, depletion and amortization costs were either recorded on a straight-line basis or related to asset retirement obligations.
Total Shale other revenue and operating income relates to natural gas gathering services provided to third-parties. The Shale segment had other revenue and operating income of $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the period-to-period comparison was primarily due to temporary production curtailments by third party customers that occurred in early 2020 due to low prices. Those curtailments were restored to full production in the latter half of 2020.
COALBED METHANE (CBM) SEGMENT
The CBM segment had earnings before income tax of $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to earnings before income tax of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The CBM segment had natural gas revenue of $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $80 million increase was primarily due to an 80.2% increase in the average sales price for natural gas in the current period. The natural gas price increases were partially offset by the 5.9% decrease in CBM gas sales volumes due to normal production declines.
The total average CBM sales price increased $0.04 per Mcf due to a $1.74 per Mcf increase in average gas sales price, offset in part by a $1.69 per Mcf change in the realized (loss) gain on commodity derivative instruments resulting from the Company's hedging program. The notional amounts associated with these financial hedges represented approximately 40.4 Bcf of the Company's produced CBM gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021 at an average loss of $1.15 per Mcf hedged. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these financial hedges represented approximately 48.7 Bcf at an average gain of $0.82 per Mcf hedged.
Total operating costs and expenses for the CBM segment were $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in total dollars and unit costs for the CBM segment were due to the following items:
•CBM lease operating expense was $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decreases in total dollars was primarily due to a decrease in water disposal costs.
•CBM transportation, gathering and compression costs were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increases in total dollars and unit costs were primarily due to an increase in firm transportation expense.
•Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs attributable to the CBM segment were $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These amounts included depletion on a unit of production basis of $0.66 per Mcfe and $0.68 per Mcfe, respectively. The decrease in the units of production depreciation, depletion and amortization rate was primarily due to an impairment in the 2020 period that reduced the carrying value of the underlying SWPA CBM asset group (See Note 8 - Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. No such impairment occurred in the current period). The remaining depreciation, depletion and amortization costs were either recorded on a straight-line basis or related to asset retirement obligations.
OTHER SEGMENT
The Other Segment includes nominal shallow oil and gas production which is not significant to the Company. It also includes the Company's purchased gas activities, unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivative instruments, realized gain on commodity derivative instruments that were monetized prior to their contractual settlement dates, exploration and production related other costs, impairments, as well as various other expenses that are managed outside the Shale and CBM segments such as SG&A, interest expense and income taxes.
The Other Segment had a loss before income tax of $1,440 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a loss before income tax of $1,103 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in total dollars is discussed below.
*Oil/Condensate is converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.
Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments and Monetization
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Other Segment recognized an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments of $1,094 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Other Segment recognized an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments of $288 million as well as cash settlements received of $84 million related to natural gas hedges that were partially monetized prior to their settlement dates. The unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments represents changes in the fair value of all the Company's existing commodity hedges on a mark-to-market basis. See Note 19 - Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the cash settlements.
Purchased Gas
Purchased gas volumes represent volumes of natural gas purchased at market prices from third-parties and then resold in order to fulfill contracts with certain customers and to balance supply. Purchased gas revenue was $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $106 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Purchased gas costs were $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The period-to-period decrease in purchased gas revenue was due to a decrease in purchased gas sales volumes, offset in part by an increase in average sales price.
Other Operating Income
•Equity income (loss) from affiliates primarily represents CNX’s share of earnings from a 50% interest in a power plant located within CNX’s CBM field. Power generated from the facility is sold into wholesale electricity markets during times of peak energy consumption. Due to the plant consuming coal mine methane gas, the plant qualifies for Pennsylvania Tier I Renewable Energy Credits.
•Excess firm transportation income represents revenue from the sale of excess firm transportation capacity to third-parties. The Company obtains firm pipeline transportation capacity to enable gas production to flow uninterrupted as sales volumes increase. In order to minimize this unutilized firm transportation expense, CNX is able to release (sell) unutilized firm transportation capacity to other parties when possible and when beneficial. The revenue from released capacity helps offset the Unutilized Firm Transportation and Processing Fees in Total Other Operating Expense.
Impairment of Exploration and Production Properties
During the year ended December 31, 2020, CNX recognized certain indicators of impairments specific to our SWPA CBM asset group and determined that the carrying value of that asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. As a result, an impairment of $62 million was recognized and is included in Impairment of Exploration and Production Properties in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impairment was related to an economic decision to temporarily idle certain wells and the related processing facility during the first quarter. See Note 8 - Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. No such impairment occurred in the current period.
Impairment of Goodwill
In connection with the Midstream Acquisition that occurred in January 2018, CNX recorded $796 million of goodwill.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if recent events or prevailing conditions indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using the qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is performed. From time to time, CNX may also bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.
In connection with CNX's assessment of goodwill in the first quarter of 2020 in relation to the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, and the decline in the observable market value of CNXM securities both in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and the overall decline in the MLP market space, CNX bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative test that utilized a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of the Midstream reporting unit. As a result of this assessment, CNX concluded that the carrying value exceed its estimated fair value, and as a result, an impairment of $473 million was included in Impairment of Goodwill in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 9 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. No such impairment occurred in the current period.
Exploration and Production Related Other Costs
•Exploratory well costs relate to the write off of an exploratory well that was still being evaluated at the end of 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined it would be more economical to access the underlying reserves from a different location.
•Lease expiration costs relate to leases where the primary term expired or will expire within the next 12 months.
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)
SG&A costs include costs such as overhead, including employee labor and benefit costs, short-term incentive compensation, costs of maintaining our headquarters, audit and other professional fees, and legal compliance expenses. SG&A costs also include non-cash long-term equity-based compensation expense.
•Long-term equity-based compensation (non-cash) increased in the period-to-period comparison due to an increase in equity awards.
•Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to a decrease in employees.
•Other increased in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting professional services.
Other Operating Expense
•Unutilized firm transportation and processing fees represent pipeline transportation capacity obtained to enable gas production to flow uninterrupted as sales volumes increase, as well as additional processing capacity for NGLs. In some instances, the Company may have the opportunity to realize more favorable net pricing by strategically choosing to sell natural gas into a market or to a customer that does not require the use of the Company’s own firm transportation capacity. Such sales would result in an increase in unutilized firm transportation expense. The Company attempts to minimize this expense by releasing (selling) unutilized firm transportation capacity to other parties when
possible and when beneficial. The revenue received when this capacity is released (sold) is included in Excess Firm Transportation Income in Total Other Operating Income. The decrease in unutilized firm transportation and processing fees in the period-to-period comparison was primarily due to an increase in utilization of firm transportation capacity in the current year due to production increases in 2021 compared to 2020.
•Idle equipment and service charges relate to temporary idling of certain of the Company’s natural gas drilling rigs as well as related equipment and other services that may be needed in the natural gas drilling and completions process. The decrease in the period-to-period comparison was the result of two of CNX’s drilling rigs being idled in the prior period.
•CNX and its subsidiaries are subject to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business. CNX accrues the estimated loss for these lawsuits and claims as litigation settlements when the loss is probable and can be estimated. (See Note 20 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). The increase in the period-to-period comparison was the result of various items, none of which were individually material.
Other Expense
•Interest income decreased in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to the receipt of interest in the prior year in connection with a severance tax refund related to a prior period and additional interest income related to the alternative minimum tax credit refund CNX received in the prior year.
•Professional services decreased in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to the prior year containing fees related to the elimination of CNXM's incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) prior to the CNXM Merger discussed below.
•Merger-related costs in the prior period consisted of transaction costs, including financial advisory, legal service and other professional fees directly attributable to the CNXM Merger (See Note 4 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information), which were recorded to Other Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Gain on Asset Sales and Abandonments, net
A gain on asset sales of $42 million related to the sale of various non-core assets (primarily rights-of-way, surface acreage and other non-core oil and gas interests) was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a gain of $21 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loss (Gain) on Debt Extinguishment
A loss on debt extinguishment of $34 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a gain on debt extinguishment of $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, CNXM purchased all of the 6.50% Senior Notes due March 2026 and CNX repaid in full and terminated the Cardinal States
Gathering Company LLC and CSG Holdings II LLC non-revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, CNX purchased the remaining $894 million of its 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2022 at an average price equal to 98.6% of the principal amount. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Interest Expense
•The $20 million decrease was primarily due to the purchase of the remaining $894 million of the 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2022 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the purchase of the $400 million 6.500% CNXM Senior Notes due March 2026 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Lower borrowings on the CNX Credit Facility and higher unrealized gains on interest rate swap agreements also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were offset in part by $400 million of 4.750% CNXM Senior Notes due 2030 issued in 2021, interest related to the addition in 2020 of $345 million of Convertible Notes due 2026, $500 million of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2029 issued in 2020, and an additional $200 million of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2027 issued in 2020. The amortization of debt discount in connection with the Convertible Notes also contributed to the offsetting increase. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to federal tax credits, state income taxes, equity compensation and the increase in certain state valuation allowances as a result of higher-than-expected unrealized losses on commodity derivative instruments during the current period. The unrealized losses represents changes in the fair value of all the Company's existing commodity hedges on a mark-to-market basis. The effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes, equity compensation and state valuation allowances, partially offset by the benefit from non-controlling interest.
See Note 6 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview, Sources and Uses
CNX generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. CNX currently believes that cash generated from operations, asset sales and the Company's borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet the Company's working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments, if any, and to provide required letters of credit for the current fiscal year. Nevertheless, the ability of CNX to satisfy its working capital requirements, to service its debt obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures, or to pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the natural gas industry and other financial and business factors, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, some of which are beyond CNX’s control.
From time to time, CNX is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agencies' statutes and regulations. CNX sometimes uses letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce the
Company's borrowing facility capacity.
CNX continuously reviews its liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to a significant decline in commodity prices and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced.
As of December 31, 2021, CNX was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. After considering the potential effect of a significant decline in commodity prices, CNX currently expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants.
CNX frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CNX has historically funded acquisitions with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt and equity financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt and equity financing, will be available to CNX on terms which CNX finds acceptable, or at all.
Factors that may Impact our Liquidity
•The Company’s cash on hand and access to additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.6 million.
•Accounts and notes receivable - trade as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $330.1 million and $145.9 million, respectively. Our accounts and notes receivable balance may fluctuate as of any balance sheet date depending on the prices we receive for our natural gas and NGLs and the volumes sold.
•Capital expenditures are expected to range between $470 million to $500 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to capital expenditures of $465.9 million in fiscal year 2021. In addition, accelerated levels of inflation may lead to price increases beyond CNX’s control that could lead to CNX incurring an increase in costs in the future.
