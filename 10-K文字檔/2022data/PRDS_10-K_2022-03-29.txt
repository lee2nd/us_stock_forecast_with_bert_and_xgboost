Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to improve the lives of patients suffering from life-threatening disease, starting with our lead candidate, PBI-0451, which is in clinical development and intended to treat and prevent coronaviral (CoV) infections. COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has emerged as the most significant pandemic threat for the world in many decades. We have built a discovery platform designed to target reactive nucleophiles, such as those in cysteine proteases. By leveraging our understanding of structure-based drug design, reversible covalent chemistry and viral biology, we have discovered and are developing novel product candidates with low nanomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 and broad activity against all known pathogenic human coronaviruses. Our lead product candidate, PBI-0451, inhibits the main coronaviral cysteine protease (Mpro), a viral protein essential for replication of all known coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In preclinical studies, PBI-0451 has demonstrated activity against all coronaviral proteases tested, as well as inhibition of replication of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, in pre-clinical studies, PBI-0451 demonstrated the potential for oral bioavailability across multiple pre-clinical species, and more recently, oral bioavailability in healthy volunteers in our on-going Phase 1 study. We believe the anti-viral potency seen against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical in vitro studies and demonstrated oral bioavailability in humans supports its potential to be an oral direct acting antiviral, or DAA, for use against SARS-CoV-2 infections. We plan to develop PBI-0451 for both oral treatment and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the highly conserved nature of the Mpro target, which is shared among all known coronaviruses, including emerging variants of concern, we believe PBI-0451 will likely retain its potency and activity against current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
On December 23, 2021, we completed the Business Combination with FSDC II, which resulted in FSDC II acquiring 100% of our issued and outstanding securities. Together with FSDC II’s cash resources, additional funding for our operations was provided through a Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE Investment”) which was completed concurrently with the Merger.
We accounted for the Business Combination as a reverse recapitalization which is the equivalent of Old Pardes issuing stock for the net assets of FSDC II, with FSDC II treated as the acquired company for accounting purposes. The net assets of FSDC II were stated at historical cost with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Reported results from operations included herein prior to the Business Combination are those of Old Pardes. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and loss per share related to Old Pardes’s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated to reflect the conversion ratio established in the Merger Agreement.
Since inception in 2020, we have devoted substantially all our efforts and financial resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, discovering product candidates and preparing and filing related patent applications and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.
Our lead product candidate, PBI-0451, is being evaluated in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in New Zealand. Our other potential product candidates and our research initiatives are in preclinical or earlier stages of development. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization or partnership of one or more of our product candidates. We have not yet successfully completed any clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of any of our product candidates, including PBI-0451, nor have we obtained any regulatory approvals, manufactured a commercial-scale drug, or conducted sales and marketing activities.
As of December 31, 2021, cash and equivalents were $268.7 million and we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to allow us to fund current planned operations beyond the next twelve months from the date of this Annual Report without additional capital. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “- Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Our future viability beyond that point is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.
Through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations with gross cash proceeds of $44.5 million from sales of preferred stock, gross cash proceeds of $7.1 million from the sale of simple agreements for future equity financing, or SAFEs, which were converted into 5,845,071 shares (4,151,942 shares as originally issued) of convertible preferred stock in January 2021 and net proceeds of approximately $257.5 million in connection with the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment, which we currently believe will be sufficient to allow us to fund current planned operations into the second half of 2023.
We have incurred operating losses since our inception through December 31, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of $51.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and had not yet generated revenues. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operation losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses to continue to increase. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly if and as we:
•continue preclinical studies and initiates new clinical trials for PBI-0451, our lead product candidate being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 disease;
•advance the development of our pipeline of other product candidates, including through business development efforts to invest in or in-license other technologies or product candidates;
•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•hire additional clinical, quality control, medical, scientific and other technical personnel to support our clinical operations;
•seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•undertake any pre-commercialization activities to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;
•expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base; and
•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our transition to operating as a public company following the Closing.
Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in prior years.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies, government funding, or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of private or public equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or other strategic transactions with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. To date, our financial condition and operations have not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot at this time predict the specific extent, duration, or full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition and operations, including ongoing and planned clinical trials and other operations required to support those clinical trials and research and development activities to advance our pipeline. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related governmental advisories and restrictions. These developments and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are impacted for an extended period, our results may be materially adversely affected.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts are successful and we commercialize our products, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty payments from such collaboration or license agreements, or a combination thereof.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for research activities, including drug discovery efforts, and the development of our potential product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include:
•expenses incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies, nonclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval;
•expenses incurred under agreements with CROs that are primarily engaged in the oversight and conduct of our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies, clinical trials and CMOs that are primarily engaged to provide preclinical and clinical drug substance and product for our research and development programs;
•other costs related to acquiring and manufacturing materials in connection with our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation batches, as well as investigative site and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;
•employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; and
•costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements.
We recognize research and development expenses as incurred. Any advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered. We estimate and accrue for the value of goods and services received from CROs, CMOs and other third parties each reporting period based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and service providers to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs.
At any one time, we may be working on multiple programs. We do not allocate employee costs and overhead costs associated to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research and discovery as well as for managing our preclinical, nonclinical, manufacturing and clinical development activities. To date, substantially all of the research and development costs incurred to date have been in connection with the development of our lead product candidate, PBI-0451.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over the next several years as we commence planned clinical trials for PBI-0451, as well as conduct other preclinical and clinical development, including submitting regulatory filings for our other product candidates. We also expect our discovery research efforts and our related personnel costs will increase and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses, including costs associated with stock-based compensation, will increase above historical levels. In addition, we may incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we may enter into license, acquisition and option agreements to acquire the rights to future product candidates.
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of the following:
•the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical and nonclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities;
•establishing an appropriate safety and efficacy profile with clinically enabling trials;
•successful patient enrollment in and the initiation and completion of clinical trials;
•the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and non-U.S. regulators;
•the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;
•establishing clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that we or our third-party manufacturers are able to make product successfully;
•development and timely delivery of clinical-grade and commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial launch;
•obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
•significant and changing government regulation;
•launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following approval, if any, of our product candidates.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical, nonclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries and related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, business development, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include insurance costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, pre-commercial planning, accounting and audit services. Our general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support the continued development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur significantly increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and other employee-related expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as we relate to the sales and marketing of that product candidate.
Change in fair value of simple agreements for future equity (SAFEs) liability
In 2020, we entered into several SAFEs with certain investors, which provided the investors the right to receive shares of our capital stock, such number to be determined by a future event, as defined in the agreements. We accounted for the obligation to issue future equity at fair value at each reporting date, with any change in the fair value reported as a component of other income (expense). In connection with the issuance of our Series A convertible preferred stock in January 2021, these contractual obligations were settled and the future equity issuance liability was reclassified to permanent equity.
Income Taxes
We have incurred net losses and have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the losses as they have been offset by valuation allowances.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 and the period from February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and for the period from February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes the components of research and development expense for the periods presented (in thousands):
Research and development expenses were $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $4.6 million for the period February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, an increase of $23.6 million. The increase was due to an increase in program costs related to advancing our lead candidate, PBI-0451, and increased personnel costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, and unallocated costs as we grew our organization. Unallocated costs include recruiting fees and overhead expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.8 million for the period February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, an increase of $9.5 million. The increase was due to increased personnel costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, as we grew our organization and increased professional services related to corporate legal fees, patent legal fees, pre-commercial planning, consulting, recruiting services and accounting services.
Change in fair value of simple agreements for future equity (SAFEs) liability
The change in fair value of the SAFEs liability was $7.7 million for the period February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, due to the increase in the fair value of the SAFEs issued during 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity and Capital
Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from any product sales or any other sources and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $268.7 million and we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to allow us to fund current planned operations into the second half of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future viability beyond that point is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations. Through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations with gross cash proceeds of $44.5 million from sales of preferred stock, gross cash proceeds of $7.1 million from the sale of SAFEs, which were converted into 5,845,071 shares (4,151,942 shares as originally issued) of convertible preferred stock in January 2021 and net proceeds of approximately $257.5 million in connection with the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented (in thousands):
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of $38.5 million partially offset by a non-cash charge of $1.2 million related to the change in stock-based compensation expense, and a net increase of working capital of $0.8 million due to increases to prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The increases to prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses was primary due to growth in our operations, the advancement of our PBI-0451 and other potential product candidates, and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.
During the period from February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities consisted of our net loss of $13.0 million, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $7.7 million related to the change in fair value of the SAFEs liability and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to growth in our operations, the advancement of our product candidates, and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $257.5 million in net proceeds from the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment and $44.3 million from the net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock.
During the period February 27, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the SAFEs issued during 2020.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and initiates clinical trials of our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on our ability to:
•advance preclinical development of our early-stage programs and initiate clinical trials of our product candidates;
•manufacture, or have manufactured on our behalf, our preclinical, nonclinical and clinical drug material and develop processes for late stage and commercial manufacturing;
•seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs, managed care, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own;
•hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company;
•manage the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights, including enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims; and
•manage the costs of operating as a public company.
Working Capital
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical and nonclinical studies and clinical trials;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•the costs, timing and ability to manufacture our product candidates to supply our clinical and preclinical development efforts and our clinical trials;
•the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade product and necessary inventory to support commercial launch;
•the ability to receive additional non-dilutive funding, including grants from organizations and foundations;
•the revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining, expanding and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and
•the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have entered into agreements in the normal course of business with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payments for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amount of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreement. These obligations and commitments are not presented.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC that are reasonably likely to have a current effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, based on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met, but some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates and accruals accordingly on a prospective basis.
We base our expenses related to external research and development services on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee, officer, director and non-employee stock option grants, estimated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The vesting period generally approximates the expected service period of the awards. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions. Changes to these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of stock options and ultimately the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements. These assumptions include:
•Fair Value of Common Stock - Prior to our Business Combination, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuation of our common stock as well as our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent third-party valuation to the date of the grant. Since the completion of our Business Combination, the fair value of each share of common stock underlying stock option grants is based on the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market as reported on the date of grant.
•Expected Term - We have opted to use the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, which is generally 10 years.
•Expected Volatility - Due to our limited operating history and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rates used are based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the stock options.
•Expected Dividend - To date, we have not issued any dividends and do not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore have estimated the dividend yield to be zero.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is also disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
