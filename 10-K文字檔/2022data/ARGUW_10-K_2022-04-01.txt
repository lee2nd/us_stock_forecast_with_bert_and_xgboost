ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 22, 2021 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Simultaneously with the consummation of our Public Offering, we consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 9,626,667 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at $11.50 per share, to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $14,440,000. We intend to consummate an initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our Public Offering that closed on September 24, 2021 and the Private Placement, and from additional issuances of, if any, our equity and our debt, or a combination of cash, equity and debt. At December 31, 2021, we held cash of $1,230,768, current liabilities of $1,156,734 and deferred underwriting compensation of $10,666,250. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an initial business combination will be successful.
Results of Operations
For the period from April 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net income of $17,993,850, and a loss from operations of $500,308, comprised of general and administrative expenses, and non-operating
income of $18,494,158, comprised of a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $19,738,959 and interest earned in the Trust Account of $32,919 less offering costs associated with warrant liabilities of $1,277,720. Through December 31, 2021, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities relating to the Public Offering, activities relating to identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates and activities relating to general corporate matters. We have not generated any revenue, other than interest income earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account. As of December 31, 2021, $310,877,919 was held in the Trust Account (including $10,666,250 of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $8.9 million from the Private Placement) and we had cash outside of the Trust Account of $1,230,768 and $1,156,734 in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, the Charter provides that none of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of an initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any of the shares of Class A common stock included in the units sold in the Public Offering (the “Units”) properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the common stock included in the Units being sold in the Public Offering if the Company does not complete an initial business combination by March 24, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of 100% of the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by March 24, 2023. Through December 31, 2021, we have not withdrawn any funds from interest earned on the trust proceeds. Other than the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, no amounts are payable to the underwriters of the Public Offering in the event of a business combination.
We have also agreed to pay an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team in an amount not to exceed $20,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. The administrative services fee commenced on September 24, 2021. For the period from April 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $60,000 under this agreement. As of December 31, 2021, $60,000 is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Prior to the consummation of our Public Offering, our only sources of liquidity were an initial purchase of Founder Shares for $25,000 by the Sponsor, and a total of $188,915 of loans from the Sponsor.
On September 24, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 30,475,000 Units, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,975,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $304,750,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 9,626,667 Private Warrants to the Sponsors at a price of $1.50 per Private Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $14,440,000.
Following the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Warrants, a total of $310,845,000 (including $10,666,250 of deferred underwriting commissions) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The remaining $8,345,000 held outside of the Trust Account was used to pay underwriting commissions of $6,095,000 and deferred offering and formation costs.
In connection with our Initial Public Offering, the Company incurred offering costs of $17,553,920 consisting of $16,761,250 of underwriters fees of which $10,666,250 was recorded as Deferred underwriting compensation and $792,670 of other offering costs. Other offering costs consisted principally of formation and preparation fees related to our Initial Public Offering. Of the total offering costs, $1,277,720 of which was allocated to the Warrants, were immediately expensed and $16,276,200 was allocated to redeemable Class A common stock, reducing the carrying amount of such shares.
Prior to the closing of our Public Offering, the Sponsor had made $188,915 in loans to the Company. The loans were non-interest
bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the completion of our Public Offering. The loans of $188,915 were fully repaid upon the consummation of our Public Offering on September 24, 2021.
For the period from April 22, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $467,222. Net income of $17,993,850 was affected by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of $32,919, income from change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $19,738,959, transaction costs allocable to warrants of $1,277,720, and changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $33,087 of cash for operating activities.
As of December 31, 2021 the Company had an unrestricted cash balance of $1,230,768, working capital $982,022, and cash and investments held in the Trust Account of $310,877,919. The Company’s working capital needs will be satisfied through the funds, held outside of the Trust Account, from the Public Offering. Interest on funds held in the Trust Account may be used to pay taxes. Further, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The terms of such loans have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
For the period from April 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we incurred an aggregate of $500,308 for legal, accounting, and filing fees relating to our SEC reporting obligations and general corporate matters, franchise tax, and miscellaneous operating expenses.
We believe that we do have sufficient liquidity to meet our current obligations and allow us to operate through March 24, 2023, assuming that an initial business combination is not consummated during that time. Over this time period, we currently anticipate incurring expenses for the following purposes:
•
due diligence and investigation of prospective target businesses;
•
legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC reporting obligations and general corporate matters;
•
structuring and negotiating an initial business combination, including the making of a down payment or the payment of exclusivity or similar fees and expenses; and
•
other miscellaneous expenses.
Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Related Party Transactions
Founder Shares
On April 29, 2021, our sponsor received 11,500,000 shares of Class B common stock (the “founder shares”) in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000. On July 21, 2021 and August 26, 2021, our sponsor returned to the Company for cancellation, at no cost, 2,875,000 and 1,437,500 founder shares, respectively, and on September 21, 2021, the Company effected a stock dividend of 0.06 shares for each founder share then outstanding, resulting in an aggregate of 7,618,750 founder shares outstanding and held by the Sponsor.
The founder shares are identical to the public shares except that the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below. In addition, up to 993,750 founder shares may be forfeited by our sponsor depending on the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. On September 24, 2021, the underwriters’ exercised their over-allotment option in full and thus these shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
Our sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its founder shares until the earlier of (A) two years after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination, or earlier if, subsequent to the Company’s initial Business Combination, the closing price of the Company’s shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $14.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading
day period commencing at least 300 days after the Company’s initial Business Combination, and (B) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction after the initial Business Combination that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property (the “Lock Up Period”).
Private Placement Warrants
Our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,626,667 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant ($14,440,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering.
A portion of the purchase price of the private placement warrants was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account such that at closing of the Public Offering, $310,845,000 was placed in the Trust Account.
Related Party Loans
On April 22, 2021, our sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”). This loan was non-interest
bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021, or the completion of the Public Offering. On September 24, 2021, the note then outstanding of $188,915 was repaid in full and the balance is $0 as of December 31, 2021.
Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance
sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
At December 31, 2021, we do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.
Service and Administrative Fees
We agreed to pay an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team in an amount not to exceed $20,000 per month from the date of closing of the Public Offering. Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.
Underwriters Agreement
The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of two percent (2%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,095,000. Additionally, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 3.5%, or $10,666,250, of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering upon the completion of the Company’s initial business combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The deferred underwriting commissions will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial
agreements involving assets.
Registration Rights
The holders of the founder shares, Private Placement Warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and upon conversion of the founder shares) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement signed on September 21, 2021. The Sponsor will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities and any other securities of the Company acquired by the Sponsor prior to the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, the Sponsor will have “piggy-back” registration rights to include its securities in other registration statements filed by the Company. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting policies:
Offering Costs
Offering costs associated with the Class A common stock issued in the amount of $16,276,200 were charged against the carrying value of the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption upon the completion of the Public Offering. Offering costs amounting to $1,277,720 were charged to the statements of operations upon the completion of the Public Offering.
Investments Held in Trust
Our portfolio of investments held in the Trust Account is comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof. The investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in gain on marketable securities, dividends and interest held statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.
Derivative Warrant Liabilities
The Company evaluated the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants (collectively, “Warrant Securities”) in accordance with ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and
Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity” and concluded that the Warrant Securities could not be accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrant Securities meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with ASC 815, the Warrant Securities are recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (the Closing Date) and remeasured at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement”, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statement of Operations in the period of change. The valuation methodology used in the determination of the fair value of financial instruments for which inputs were used at December 31, 2021 was Modified Black-Scholes model and Monte-Carlo Simulation. The key inputs for the valuation models used to calculate the fair value includes implied volatility, risk-free interest rate, exercise price and expected term. The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility based on the traded price of the warrant. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa. The risk-free interest rate assumption was performed in a risk-neutral framework, which requires a risk-free rate assumption as a primary input and relied upon constant maturity treasury yields. The expected term was based on the maturity of the warrant, which is five years following the expected merger date.
Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
The Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and is measured at redemption value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period.
At December 31, 2021, the Class A common stock reflected in the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. Net income (loss) per common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class
method in calculating earnings per share. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.
The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with (i) the Public Offering, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 15,237,500 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common stock is the same as basic net loss per common stock for the periods presented.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06,
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)
and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)
(“ASU 2020-06”)
to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06
eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06
amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted
method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06
is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06
would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statement.
