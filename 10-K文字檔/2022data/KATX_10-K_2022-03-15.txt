Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information.”
General
The Company has limited operations and is actively seeking merger, reverse merger, acquisition or business combination opportunities with an operating business or other financial transaction opportunities. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. Accordingly, during such period, the Company does not expect to achieve sufficient income to offset its operating expenses, resulting in operating losses that may require the Company to use and thereby reduce its cash balance. For further information on the Company’s plan of operation and business, see Item I, Current Business. Until the Company completes a merger, reverse merger or other financial transaction, and unless interest rates increase dramatically, the Company expects to continue to incur a loss of between $10,000 to $12,000 for the fourth quarter ending November 30, 2021 and thereafter of between $1,000 to $2,000 per quarter. The increase in fourth quarter expenses relates to a Company audit and 10K filings.
