Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
THE FOLLOWING PRESENTATION OF OUR PLAN OF OPERATION OF SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

Year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Revenues
Net Revenues increased to $1,243,655 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1,374 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from the acquisitions of television stations in 2021 and the $1,243,655 revenues generated by the lease agreements held by those stations. We anticipate 2022 Net Revenues will increase compared to 2021 Net Revenues as a result a full year of operating the television stations acquired during 2021 and the launch of BLOCKCHAIN.TV in 2022.
Amortization
Amortization increased to $105,450 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from the Sovryn acquisitions in 2021 of television stations that have amortizable tangible and intangible assets.
Selling, general and administrative fees
Selling, general and administrative fees increased to $350,770 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $29,600 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of selling and overhead expenses for our television stations that we started operating in 2021 following their acquisitions.
Television operations
Television operation expenses are $266,644 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The expenses are direct costs of operating the television stations we acquired in 2021.
Professional Fees
Professional Fees increased to $1,850,041 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $89,144 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the legal and accounting expense associated with the acquisitions of television stations, the financing associated with those acquisitions and, the expense associated with regulatory filings for the SEC, including the Form S1 Registration.
Goodwill impairment loss
Our goodwill impairment loss was $4,224,962 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Due to a sustained decline in the market capitalization of our Common Stock during the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test. Management considered that, along with other possible factors affecting the assessment of our operations for the purposes of performing a goodwill impairment assessment, including management assumptions about expected future revenue forecasts and discount rates, changes in the overall economy, trends in the stock price, estimated control premium, other operating conditions, and the effect of changes in estimates and assumptions that could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill. As a result of the significant decline in the current market capitalization despite any of the other positive factors contemplated and relatively little change in our ongoing business operations, the outcome of this goodwill impairment test resulted in a charge for the impairment of goodwill of $4,224,962 recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Loss on asset disposals
Our loss on asset disposals was $1,737,147 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our initial objective was to create one the largest, most comprehensive, state of the art OTA content distribution platforms to capitalize on the changing media and distribution landscape and on the growing OTA viewership in the U.S. We are exploring more capital efficient and technology centric alternatives to its planned station acquisition distribution platform. While there is no guarantee that it will be successful with this alternative approach, we have determined that it will postpone further capital expenditures on acquisitions and as a result, the planned acquisitions of W27EB-Chicago, KPHE-Phoenix, KVSD-San Diego, WANN-Atlanta and KDTL-St. Louis stations have been terminated and future acquisition plans have been put on hold while we evaluate this alternative approach. As a result, we recognized $1,737,147 of losses from disposition of OTA assets.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased to $5,553,121 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $237,417 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from financing associated with the acquisition of television stations.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
Our loss on debt extinguishment was $5,553,121 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was the result of non-cash charges we recognized when we amended the stock price conversion terms of our Notes held the Investors and by extinguishing notes payable by issuing shares of our Series D Preferred Stock.
Gain from derivative that is not designated in a hedging relationship
Our gain from derivative that is note designated in a hedging relationship was $10,065,713 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Discontinued Operations
Our loss from discontinued operations was $479,117 and $390,376 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On November 15, 2021, we sold our subsidiary, CZJ License Inc., for $250,000 and designated its operations as discontinued. The previous year’s assets, liabilities and expenses have been similarly classified for comparative purposes.
Net Loss
Net Loss increased to $14,262,579 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $910,163 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of $5,553,141 of interest expense for debt instruments we issued in 2021, a $4,224,962 goodwill impairment loss, and $1,737,147 in losses from asset disposals, Net Loss on a basic and diluted basis of $.040 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, based on 352,843,639 weighted average shares outstanding, as compared to a Net Loss of $0.047 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on 19,453,890 weighted average shares outstanding. The increase in weighted average shares outstanding relates primarily to issuances of 192,073,017 shares to the Investors on October 11, 2021 in connection with the $16,500,000 Notes we sold, the 1,091,388,889 shares we issued on October 11, 2021 to Preferred Series E-1 holders in pursuant to an Exchange Agreement and the into 255,555,556 shares we issued on November 2, 2021 in exchange for shares of our Preferred Series Stock.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Working Capital
As at December 31, 2021, we had $55,656 in cash and a $4,373,271 working capital deficit, compared to cash of $9,491 and working capital deficit of $533,548 as at December 31, 2020.
We will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We have not yet made the $0.4 million interest payments on the Notes held by Arena Partners LC that were due on April 1, 2022 and July 1, 2022, and as a result, under the Note terms, the interest rate is 20.0% per annum. We are currently in discussions with Arena Capital LP, on a plan of forbearance; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in completion of a plan, which may disrupt our operations and result in a restructuring of obligations.
We expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and/or debt securities; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful at raising additional capital in the future. If our plans are not achieved and/or if significant unanticipated events occur, we may have to further modify our business plan, which may require us to raise additional capital. As of December 31, 2021, our principal source of liquidity was our cash, which totaled $55,656. Historically, our principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the sale of common stock and preferred stock and related party loans. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, to make acquisitions and to pay interest on our Notes. We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for continuing operations associated with rolling out the business plan and for interest payments.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
We used cash of $6,203,200 in operating activities during fiscal 2021 compared to cash used of $489,325 in operating activities during the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily the result of increase in expenses associated with the build out and roll out of our business plan.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
We used cash of $14,715,635 in investing activities during fiscal 2021 compared to cash used of $10,000 in investing activities during the previous fiscal year. The increase was the result of acquisitions and expenses associated with KNLA/KNET, KVVV, KYMU television stations, deposits associated with signed purchase agreements and loans made to Top Dog Productions Inc.
Net Cash Provided (Used in) by Financing Activities
Net cash flows provided by financing activities of $20,965,000 for fiscal 2021, were from the proceeds of the Arena financing in February 2021 and Share subscriptions received but not issued for our Series G preferred stock and proceeds from subordinated loans, compared to $507,450 of cash provided by financing activities during the previous fiscal year.

Going Concern
The independent auditors’ reports accompanying our December 31, 2021 and 2020 financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Critical Accounting Policies
We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions that may deviate from actual results. In particular, management makes estimates regarding the useful life of long-lived assets related to depreciation and amortization expense, estimates regarding fair value of our reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment of both long-lived assets and goodwill and estimates of expense related to our debt and equity instruments. Each of these estimates is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion.
Long-Lived Assets, Depreciation and Amortization Expense and Valuation
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. In 2021, we recognized that we would not complete the acquisition of the TV station assets of W27EB and KPHE TV and we wrote off $1,150,000 in deposits paid to sellers of those assets.
Goodwill Valuation
Management performed the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments as of December 31, 2021 and concluded that our goodwill for the Sovryn acquisition was impaired as of that date. Goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We follow a two-step process for testing impairment. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit’s fair value of its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value.
Derivative Liabilities
We have certain financial instruments that are derivatives or contain embedded derivatives. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with us, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment.
