●
The increase in net loss of $4.7 million, as discussed above.

The increase in non-cash movements of $5.31 million, primarily due to the movement on the gain on debt extinguishment of $12.6 million, the increase in the movement on the amortization of debt discount of $1,1 million, and the increase in the movement of fair value of warrants granted of $0.9 million, offset by the net movement in derivative liabilities of $9.1 million.
●
The absorption of cash into working capital of $0.6 million during the current year, primarily due to the acquisition of Evernia and ATHI on July 1, 2021.
Cash used in investing activities was $0.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We invested $0.5 million (2020 - $0.7 million) in the Evernia treatment facility based in West Palm Beach, prior to acquisition.

Cash generated by financing activities was $0.6 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 200, respectively. During the current year we raised $1.2 million and repaid $0.5 million in convertible notes, primarily to fund the Evernia operations.
Over the next twelve months we estimate that the company will require approximately $6.5 million in funding to repay its obligations, if these obligations are not converted to equity and for funding working capital as we continue to seek opportunities for addiction treatment in the US markets. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. In the opinion of management, the Company’s liquidity risk is assessed as high.
