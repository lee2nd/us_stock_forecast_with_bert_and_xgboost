ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this annual report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
XBiotech Inc. (“XBiotech” or the “Company) is a pre-market biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing True Human™ monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. True Human™ monoclonal antibodies are those which occur naturally in human beings-as opposed to being derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. We believe that naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be safer and more effective than their non-naturally occurring counterparts. XBiotech is focused on developing its True Human™ pipeline and manufacturing system.
Following the Janssen Transaction in December 2019, the tender offer in February 2020, and the dividends paid in July 2021, retained earnings as of December 31, 2021 were $5.2 million. We had a net loss of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a net income of $668.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the next year, we expect the revenues from a new manufacturing contract with a Janssen-related company will generate offset operating expenses for our research and development activities. In addition, we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical testing and clinical. In addition to these increasing research and development expenses, we expect general and administrative costs to increase, particularly in consideration of current inflationary trends. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve or sustain profitability, and we may never do so. As of December 31, 2021, we had 97 employees.
Revenues
Prior to receiving payments under the clinical manufacturing agreement entered into in connection with the Janssen Transaction, we had not generated any revenue. Under the clinical manufacturing agreement, we manufacture bermekimab for use by Janssen in clinical trials, in exchange for fixed payments, paid in quarterly installments through 2021. In Febuary 2022, we entered a new manufacturing contract with a Janssen-related company whereby we will continue to manufacture bermekimab through December 2023. The contract terminates in December 2023.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with identifying and developing our drug candidates. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, share-based compensation, the purchase of equipment, laboratory and manufacturing supplies, facility costs, costs for preclinical and clinical research, development of quality control systems, quality assurance programs and manufacturing processes. We charge all research and development expenses to operating expenses as incurred.
Clinical development timelines, likelihood of success and total costs vary widely. We do not currently track our internal research and development costs or our personnel and related costs on an individual drug candidate basis. We use our research and development resources, including employees and our drug discovery technology, across multiple drug development programs. As a result, we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our research and development programs or our clinical and preclinical drug candidates. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have recorded total research and development expenses, including share-based compensation, of $247.6 million. Our total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $28.3 million, compared to $9.5 million the year ended December 31, 2020, and $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Share-based compensation accounted for $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses was 75% for the year ended December 31, 2021, 34% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 77% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The percentages, excluding share-based compensation, were 79% for the year ended December 31, 2021, 36% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 81% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success and commercial potential. For research and development candidates in early stages of development, it is premature to estimate when material net cash inflows from these projects might occur.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in administrative, finance, business development and human resource functions, as well as the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property and patent filing and maintenance expenses, share-based compensation, and professional fees for legal services. Our total general and administration expenses was $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Share-based compensation accounted for $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses incurred during the reported periods.
We base estimates on our historical experience, known trends and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Share-Based Compensation
Stock-based awards are measured at fair value at each grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expenses ratably over the requisite service period of the option award.
Determination of the Fair Value of Share-Based Compensation Grants
The determination of the fair value of share-based compensation arrangements is affected by a number of variables, including estimates of the expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the award. We value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions. Black-Scholes option-pricing model and other option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. If we made different assumptions, our share-based compensation expenses, net loss, and net loss per common share could be significantly different. We determine that the fair value of common stock as the closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported by NASDAQ on the option grant date.
The following summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the periods indicated:
With the exception of the dividend paid in 2021, we have assumed no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates for U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the expected life of our stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method when the stock option includes “plain vanilla” terms. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the agreement term. We used the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. For stock options that did not include “plain vanilla” terms, we used the contractual life of the stock option as the expected life. Such stock options consisted primarily of options issued to our board of directors that were immediately vested at issuance. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized, and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, with the exception of certain Canada deferred tax assets that will reverse in a period in which they may be carried back, we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we believe the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of our forecasted future results. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment. We will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence and will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.
We account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.
Clinical Trial Accruals
Expense accruals related to clinical trials are based on the Company’s estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party service providers conduct and manage clinical trials on the Company’s behalf. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing costs, the Company estimates the period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period based upon patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to the Company by its vendors on their actual costs incurred. Any estimates of the level of services performed or the costs of these services could differ from actual results.
Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows (in thousands):
We had not generated any revenue before the year 2020. Under the clinical manufacturing agreement with Janssen, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we have recorded $18.0 million as manufacturing revenue. Clinical trial revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 is based on the Transition Services Agreement under which we agreed to continue operational management, on a fee-for-service basis, of certain clinical trials completed on December 2020 related to bermekimab, which includes $303 thousand pass-through revenue and $91 thousand mark-up revenue.
Under the same agreement with Janssen, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we have recorded $18.0 million as manufacturing revenue. Clinical trial revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $20.0 million pass-through revenue for two ongoing trials and $6.0 million mark-up revenue. The other revenue $22 thousand is generated from the grant of a non-exclusive license.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows (in thousands):
We had not incurred any cost of goods sold before the year 2020.The manufacturing cost for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 represents period expense for manufacturing, quality assurance and quality control departments. Drug for the Janssen Transaction was mainly manufactured in the year 2020. Part of the cost was deferred to the year 2021. Clinical trial cost for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, is $303 thousand and 21.7 million respectively, which is the pass-through expenses for two trials. These two trials were completed in December 2020.
Expenses
Research and Development
Research and Development costs are summarized as follows (in thousands):
We do not currently track our internal research and development costs or our personnel and related costs on an individual drug candidate basis. We use our research and development resources, including employees and our drug discovery technology, across multiple drug development programs. As a result, we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our research and development programs or our clinical and preclinical drug candidates.
Research and development expenses increased 197% to $28.3 million for year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to classification of certain expenses incurred in connection with the Janssen. A portion of manufacturing department expenses were reclassed to cost of goods sold in 2021 compared to all manufacturing department expensed being reclassed to cost of goods sold in 2020, as all such expense incurred in 2020 were related to the clinical trial manufacturing agreement in the Janssen Transaction. The decrease of share-based compensation is due to the new grants to employees and Chief Executive Officer in the fourth quarter of 2019, being fully amortized in 2021. The other expense in 2021 includes the depreciation, facility allocation and other miscellaneous expense.
Research and development expenses decreased 60% to $9.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was mainly due to classification of certain expenses incurred in connection with the Janssen Transaction to cost of goods sold rather than research and development expense. Manufacturing department expenses related to the clinical manufacture agreement we entered into as part of the Janssen Transaction, as well as expenses pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement entered into as part of the Janssen Transaction were classified as cost of goods sold. Stock-based compensation expenses increased due to the new grants to employees and Chief Executive Officer in the fourth quarter of 2019.
General and Administrative
General and administrative costs are summarized as follows (in thousands):
General and administrative expenses decreased 48% to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The share-based compensation decrease was mainly due to the new grants to employees and Chief Executive Officer in the fourth quarter of 2019 fully amortized in 2021. Professional fees decreased $1.2 million mainly due to the Company no longer requiring professional and legal fees related to the tender offer completed in February 2020. Also, there was a $2.5 million decrease in other expense, mainly due to the reduced D&O insurance cost.
General and administrative expenses increased 155% to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The share-based compensation increase was mainly due to the new grants to employees and Chief Executive Officer in the fourth quarter of 2019. Salaries and related expense increased due to the bonus to the Chief Executive Officer in June 2020. Also, professional fees increased $1.0 million mainly due to professional and legal fees related to the tender offer completed in February 2020.
Other Income
The following table summarizes other income (in thousands):
The interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was mainly from the interest generated from the Company’s Canadian bank account and escrow account. The other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a Canada Revenue Agency charge on tender offer tax withholding and for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a charitable donation. Foreign exchange gain (loss) was mainly due to the fluctuation between the US dollar and the Euro, and the US dollar and the Canadian dollar in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $750 million gain from the business purchase agreement with Janssen in December. The interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was mainly from the interest generated from the Company’s Canadian bank account and escrow account. The other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a charitable donation. Foreign exchange gain (loss) was mainly due to the fluctuation between the US dollar and the Euro, and the US dollar and the Canadian dollar in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.
Income Taxes
Overall income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 is $8.0 million primarily due to an estimated $9.5 million refund of prior year Canadian income taxes through a carryback of tax losses to 2019. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.6 million primarily due to an estimated $1.8 million refund of prior year Canadian taxes through a carryback of tax losses to 2019. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $49.8 million due to the income generated from the Janssen Transaction.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash requirements could change materially as a result of the progress of our research and development and clinical programs, licensing activities, acquisitions, divestitures or other corporate developments.
Since our inception on March 22, 2005 through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations principally through private placements and public offerings of equity securities, which have provided aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $118.2 million. We received $675 million in cash proceeds from the Janssen Transaction in the year ended December 31, 2019 (Another $75 million was placed into escrow and released in 2021, as noted below), and $18.4 million revenue from the manufacturing agreement and clinical trial agreement for the year ended December 31, 2021. In June 2021, we received the remaining $75 million cash as the escrow receivable from the same transaction. In July 2021, we paid $75 million in dividends to shareholders. During the following 12 months, we expect that the revenues from Janssen Transaction Addendum will generate partial of the cash for our research and development activities. At December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $237.0 million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $237.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $714.6 million at December 31, 2019.The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash (in thousands):
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our operating activities generated net cash of $69.4 million and used net cash of $65.1 million, and $18.3 million respectively. The change in cash from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from the $75 million escrow received. The use of net cash in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from our net incomes and losses and the payment for income tax. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 is mainly caused by the 2019 income tax payment $54.1 million paid in the year 2020. Also, we generated revenue from Janssen Transaction in the year 2021 and 2020.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our investing activities changed net cash of $3.5 million, $3.7 million, and $674.8 million, respectively. The use of cash in the year 2021 and 2020 was for building expansion and the warehouse in construction. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to no $675 million gain from the Janssen Transaction in the year 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our financing activities used net cash proceeds of $67 million and $409.7 million, respectively and during the years ended December 31, 2019, our financing activities provided $42.1 million. In July 2021, we paid $75 million in dividends to shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, employee exercised stock options to purchase a total of 1.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $8.0 million in net proceeds. During the year ended December 31, 2020, employees exercised stock options to purchase a total of 1.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $10.3 million in net proceeds. On February 19, 2020, we used approximately $420 million to purchase 14,000,000 common shares at a price of $30.00 per share, relating to the tender offer completed in February 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 4.8 million shares under the Common Shares Purchase Agreement with Piper Jaffray & Co for net proceeds of approximately $38 million. Employees exercised stock options to purchase a total of 771 thousand shares of our common stock for approximately $3.8 million in net proceeds.
We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the future. Further, the clinical manufacturing agreement with Janssen expires on December 2023, after which we do not expect to receive any additional revenue under that agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents, which totaled approximately $237.0 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.
