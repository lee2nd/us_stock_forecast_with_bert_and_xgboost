Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed above under "Forward-Looking Statements" and under the caption "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Industry Trends
The IT services industry is extremely competitive and characterized by continuous changes in client requirements and improvements in technologies. Our competition varies significantly by geographic region, as well as by the type of service provided. Many of our competitors are larger than CTG, and have greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. In addition, the Company frequently competes with a client’s use of its own internal IT staff for projects. Our industry continues to be impacted by the use of lower-cost offshore delivery capabilities (primarily India and other parts of Asia). There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
The market demand for the Company’s services is heavily dependent on information and technology-related spending by major corporations, organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve. The pace of technology advances, changes in business requirements, and the practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services we provide. Competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong as there are numerous competitors. The demand for the Company's IT Solutions and Services business significantly improved in 2021 as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was lower in 2021 than in 2020. In 2020, demand was reduced, primarily in our Non-Strategic Technology Services business, due to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the economies of the countries and the markets we serve. In 2020, to offset this decrease in demand, the Company took action to reduce its expenses, including a full-time furlough for certain employees and a 20% furlough for nearly all other non-billable employees, including the senior management team. This furlough was in place for about six months, and ended with the close of the Company’s 2020 fiscal third quarter.
The Company also actively participated in government-sponsored programs in its European operations, including Belgium, France and Luxembourg, that partially reimbursed the Company for the costs of employees that were made idle by the COVID-19 pandemic. This primarily included employees that were previously billable on an engagement, but the client made a decision to stop or end a project prior to completion. The Company continued to participate in these programs, but the benefit to the Company’s European operations was diminished subsequent to August 2020 as the respective governments reduced the reimbursement under these programs at that time. The Company believes that if these employees had remained billable throughout 2020, the revenue they would have generated would have approximated the reimbursements received from the various governments.
Revenue and Cost Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the client. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company’s performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the client. On most fixed price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the client to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the client controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company’s estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.
The Company’s revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows:
Segments
The Company provides information technology and related services to its clients. These services include digital IT Solutions and Services, and Non-Strategic Technology Services. With digital IT Solutions and Services, the Company generally takes responsibility for the deliverables and some level of project and staff management, and these services may include high-end advisory or business-related consulting. When providing Non-Strategic Technology Services, including managed staffing, staff augmentation, and volume staffing, personnel are provided to clients based upon their requirements for specific skills, who then, in turn, take their direction from clients’ managers.
The Company’s strategy throughout its operations has been, and continues to be, to expand the amount of IT Solutions and Services it provides to its clients as compared with Non-Strategic Technology Services, and to focus on delivering digital solutions. IT Solutions and Services provide significant value to our clients, and drive higher bill rates and margins for the Company. Our existing solutions include business, technology, and operations solutions that aid our clients in digitally transforming their company, and ultimately meet the needs of their clients. The digital services the Company delivers includes the Internet of Things, Intelligent Automation, Data and Analytics, Cloud and Automated Testing.
In prior years, and in 2021 prior to the fourth quarter, the Company reported its results in one segment. This included operating segments for each of North America and Europe. The services the Company provided, regardless of geography or industry, were similar in nature and produced similar results. Additionally, the CEO, who is the Company’s chief operating decision maker, made decisions on investments and allocated resources at the North America or Europe level. Accordingly, given the consistency of the services provided and results, the Company aggregated those results into one reporting segment.
During the 2021 fourth quarter, the Company further refined its strategy to focus on providing digital services within its IT Solutions and Services business in both North America and in Europe. The focus includes investing in business development, solutions, delivery, and marketing for IT Solutions and Services, and critically evaluating each significant staffing engagement as it comes up for renewal to determine if the Company would continue to provide those services to its client. These decisions are based on, among other factors, critically evaluating the work performed, the availability of the resources, the client, the long-term opportunities for the services provided at the client, and the revenue and profit associated with the engagement. As part of this process, the Company determined that there are certain lower margin staffing services within its business that are no longer part of the Company’s long-term business plan.
Accordingly, in connection with this refinement of the Company’s strategy in the 2021 fourth quarter, the Company is now operating and reporting in three segments within its business: North America IT Solutions and Services, Europe IT Solutions and Services, and Non-Strategic Technology Services. See Item 1. Business, “IT Solutions and Services,” and “Non-Strategic Technology Services” for further discussion of these segments.
CTG’s revenue by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
The Company provides a majority of its services in five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), financial services, manufacturing, and energy. The remainder of CTG’s revenue is derived from general markets.
CTG’s revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows:
Results of Operations
The table below sets forth percentage information calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations as included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this report.
2021 as compared with 2020
The Company’s operating segments recorded revenue in 2021 and 2020 as follows:
North America IT Solutions and Services revenue increased $33.6 million or 49.4% in 2021 as compared with 2020. The increase was due to a focused effort to invest in and grow this business as it has significantly higher bill rates and margins than Non-Strategic Technology Services. Additionally, the Pandemic had a lesser impact on this segments in 2021. Europe IT Solutions and Services revenue increased $14.5 million or 9.4% in 2021, and was driven by strong demand in a number of the countries in which we operate.
Non-Strategic Technology Services revenue decreased $21.9 million or 15.3% during 2021 as compared with 2020. The Non-Strategic Technology revenue decrease was in part due to the Company continuing to disengage from its lowest margin staffing projects, and from a continued decrease in demand for these services which began during the Pandemic.
The Company recorded revenue by geography in 2021 and 2020 as follows:
Reimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $1.1 million and $1.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company includes all billable consultants, including both employees and subcontractors, in its headcount. The Company’s total headcount was approximately 3,450 at December 31, 2021, which was a 12% decrease from approximately 3,900 at December 31, 2020. As the Company continues to disengage from lower margin non-strategic technology services, headcount is expected to continue to decrease. Approximately 90% of this headcount was for technical resources and 10% for support positions.
The increase in revenue in 2021 as compared with 2020 in the Company’s European operations was in part due to the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company’s European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2021 as compared with 2020, the average value of the Euro increased 3.6%, and the average value of the British Pound increased 7.2%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is recorded in Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2020 to 2021, total European revenue would have been approximately $6.8 million lower, or $167.1 million as compared with the $173.9 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 4.1%. Operating income was positively impacted by $0.5 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 given the increase in the exchange rates year-over-year.
The Company continues to monitor the impact that the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (Brexit) has had on its operations. To date, there has been a nominal impact on the Company’s operating results from Brexit. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial as compared with the Company’s total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the nominal impact the exit has had on the Company’s operations to date to change in the foreseeable future.
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), CTG’s largest client, accounted for $74.8 million or 19.1% and $77.5 million or 21.2% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The National Technical Services Agreement with IBM expires on October 27, 2023. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company provides its services as a predominant supplier primarily to IBM’s Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 68% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2021. The Company’s accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $8.9 million and $11.3 million, respectively.
We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from IBM in future years; however, a significant decline or the loss of the revenue from this client would have a significant negative effect on our operating results. No other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in 2021 or 2020.
The Company recorded operating results in 2021 and 2020 in its operating segments as follows:
North America IT Solutions and Services direct costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 67.9% and 64.7% of revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This segment included a large training, implementation, and support engagement for a health system that drove higher direct costs in 2021, which resulted in a lower gross margin, 32.1% of revenue in 2021 compared with 35.3% of revenue in 2020.
Europe IT Solutions and Services direct costs were similar in 2021 and 2020 totaling 76.2% and 75.6% of revenue, respectively. Non-Strategic Technology Services incurred a decrease in directs costs of 0.5% from 89.4% of revenue in 2020 to 88.9% in 2021. As a result, the gross margin increased to 11.1% from 10.6%. The increase year-over-year was driven by the Company continuing to disengage from the lowest margin staffing engagements.
Operating expenses were lower in 2021 as a percentage of revenue as compared with 2020 in each of the Company’s segments despite continued investments in business development, solutions and delivery in the North America and Europe IT Solutions and Services segments. These decreases reflected operating leverage in the North America and Europe IT Solutions and Services segments, and a concerted effort in in the Non-Strategic Technology Services segment to reduce costs and improve profits.
Interest and other income (expense) was (0.2)% of revenue in 2021 and 0.4% of revenue in 2020. In 2020, the Company recorded non-taxable life insurance gains of approximately $1.0 million as two of its former executives passed away, and gains of approximately $0.8 million from the sale of a building.
The Company’s effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon the full year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR in 2021 was (17.0)%, while the 2020 ETR was 28.3%. The ETR in 2021 was impacted by a number of items, including a reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets.
Net income for 2021 was 3.5% of revenue or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with 2.1% of revenue or $0.53 per diluted share in 2020. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 15.0 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2021 and 14.4 million in 2020.
2020 as compared with 2019
The Company’s operating segments recorded revenue in 2020 and 2019 as follows:
North America IT Solutions and Services revenue decreased $6.2 million or 8.3% in 2020 as compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in IT Solutions and Services in our healthcare vertical market as a large
project in process during 2019 ended. In our European operations, IT Solutions and Services demand remained strong as revenue increased $6.7 million or 4.6%. The strong demand was complemented by the acquisition of StarDust, a company that provides crowd testing and quality assurance services in France and Canada, in March 2020.
Non-Strategic Technology Services revenue decreased $28.6 million or 16.7% during 2020 as compared with 2019. The Non-Strategic Technology Services revenue decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand resulting from the Pandemic. Additionally, a number of contracts were not renewed given the low level of profitability of the services provided.
The Company recorded revenue in 2020 and 2019 as follows:
The revenue decrease in North America in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand for the Company's Non-Strategic Technology Services business due to the impact the Pandemic had on the economies in the markets we serve. Additionally, the Company continued to disengage from its lowest margin non-strategic technology services as part of its strategy. Demand in some areas of our IT Solutions and Services business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market, also declined driven by the impact of the Pandemic and the completion of a large engagement in 2019. The revenue increase in Europe was primarily due to strong demand for the Company’s services in the European markets we serve, and the acquisition of StarDust on March 3, 2020, which at the time of acquisition had estimated annual revenue of approximately $6.0 million. Reimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $1.9 million and $2.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company’s total headcount was approximately 3,900 at December 31, 2020, which was a 1.3% decrease from approximately 3,950 at December 31, 2019. Approximately 91% of this headcount was for technical resources and 9% for support positions.
The increase in revenue in the Company’s European operations in 2020 as compared with 2019 was in part due to the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company’s European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2020 as compared with 2019, the average value of the Euro increased 2.0%, and the average value of the British Pound increased 0.5%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is recorded in Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2019 to 2020, total European revenue would have been approximately $3.0 million lower, or $158.8 million as compared with the $161.8 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 5.1%. Operating income was positively impacted by $0.1 million in 2020 as compared with 2019 given the increase in the exchange rates year-over-year.
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), CTG’s largest client, accounted for $77.5 million or 21.2% and $84.9 million or 21.5% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The National Technical Services Agreement with IBM expires on October 27, 2023. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company provides its services as a predominant supplier primarily to IBM’s Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 66% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2020. The Company’s accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $11.3 million and $23.0 million, respectively.
No other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in 2020 or 2019.
The Company operating results in 2020 and 2019 in its operating segments as follows:
The results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation, which reflects changes made to our reporting structure during the fourth quarter of 2021. Refer to footnote 13, “Segments and Enterprise-Wide Disclosures” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for detailed discussion about these changes to our segments.
Direct costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 64.7% and 68.1% of revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively, for North America IT Solutions and Services, and 75.6% and 77.5% of revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively, for Europe IT Solutions and Services. In North America, a large project which had higher direct costs, and therefore lower margins, ended in 2019. In Europe, the addition of Stardust via acquisition in March 2020 had a positive impact on the overall gross margins of this segment. In the Non-Strategic Technology Services segment, the decision to disengage from a large, lower margin non-strategic technology services engagement had a modest impact on the year’s direct cost percentage.
Operating expenses were higher in the North America IT Solutions and Services segment in 2020 as the Company made a concerted effort to invest in business development, solutions and delivery resources to position the segment for future revenue growth. In the Europe IT Solutions and Services segment, operating expenses fell as a percentage of revenue due to the operating leverage resulting from higher revenue. In the Non-Strategic Technology Services segment, operating expenses decreased as the Company made a concerted effort to reduce its expenses to increase profits.
Other income (expense) was 0.4% of revenue in 2020 and (0.2)% of revenue in 2019. In 2020, the Company recorded non-taxable life insurance gains of approximately $1.0 million as two of its former executives passed away, and gains of approximately $0.8 million from the sale of a building.
The Company’s effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon the full year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR in 2020 was 28.3%, while the 2019 ETR was 34.4%. The ETR in 2020 was impacted by a number of items, including non-taxable life insurance gains, a one-time tax benefit of approximately $0.08 per share for a change in tax legislation, offset by higher effective tax rates in the Company’s European operations where the Company generated most of its income in 2020.
Net income for 2020 was 2.1% of revenue or $0.53 per diluted share, compared with 1.0% of revenue or $0.29 per diluted share in 2019. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 14.4 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2020 and 14.0 million in 2019.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company’s management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company’s significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company’s management in their application, have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company’s critical accounting estimates are related to the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes, and the valuation of goodwill.
Income Taxes-Valuation Allowances on Deferred Tax Assets
At December 31, 2021, the Company had a total of approximately $4.9 million of deferred tax assets, and approximately $1.8 million of deferred tax liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. The deferred tax assets, net, primarily consist of deferred compensation, loss carryforwards, and state taxes. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period are determined based upon the changes in the differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates when these differences are estimated to reverse. The Company has made certain assumptions regarding the timing of the reversal of these assets and liabilities, and whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to recognize all or a part of any gross deferred tax asset of the Company.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had deferred tax assets totaling approximately $1.4 million recorded resulting from net operating losses in previous years. The Company has analyzed each jurisdiction’s tax position, including forecasting potential taxable income in future periods and the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards as applicable, and determined that it is unclear whether all of these deferred tax assets will be realized at any point in the future. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, the Company had offset a portion of these assets with a valuation allowance totaling approximately $0.3 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 million.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers, within each taxing jurisdiction, whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized, or that a valuation allowance is required. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing realizability of its deferred tax assets. A key component of this assessment is management’s critical evaluation of current and future impacts of business and economic factors on the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income. Factors that may affect the Company’s ability to generate taxable income include, but are not limited to increased competition, a decline in revenue or margins, a loss of market share, the availability of qualified professional staff, and a decrease in demand for the Company’s services.
The Company’s deferred tax assets and their potential realizability are evaluated each quarter to determine if any changes should be made to the valuation allowance. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company made the decision to reverse its valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in the United States. The Company generated U.S. book and tax income during 2019, 2020, and 2021 resulting in a cumulative income position for the three years ended December 31, 2021. The Company believes its financial outlook remains positive and the uncertainty around the Pandemic has decreased. Given the positive U.S. financial results and outlook, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to fully realize its U.S. deferred tax assets and reversed the valuation allowance totaling $5.2 million at December 31, 2021. The analysis the Company prepared to determine the valuation allowance required significant judgment and assumptions regarding future market conditions as well as forecasts for profits, taxable income, and taxable income by jurisdiction. Due to the sensitivity of the analysis, changes to the assumptions in subsequent periods could have a material effect on the valuation allowance. Any further change in the valuation allowance in the future could result in a change in the Company’s ETR. A 1% change in the ETR in 2021 would have increased or decreased net income by approximately $117,000, or $0.01 per diluted share.
Goodwill Valuation
Goodwill recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 totaled $19.7 million and relates to acquisitions completed by the Company in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The acquisition of Soft Company in 2018 and StarDust in 2020 are in the France reporting unit, while the 2019 acquisition of Tech-IT is in the Luxembourg reporting unit. During 2021, $1.4 million of goodwill was allocated to the North America IT Solutions and Services segment, while the balance of $18.3 million remains in the Europe IT Solutions and Services segment. There was no impairment prior to or after the allocation of goodwill to the North America IT Solutions and Services segment. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s goodwill balance totaled $21.3 million and $16.7 million, respectively, and was wholly included in the Company’s Europe IT Solutions and Services segment.
As of October 2021 fiscal month-end, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test with the assistance of an external consultant and estimated the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of the income (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies). The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) method that utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value of the reporting unit. The future cash flows for the reporting units were projected based upon on our estimates of future revenue, operating income and other factors such as working capital and capital expenditures. As part of our projections, we took into account expected industry and market conditions for the industries in which the reporting units operate, as well as trends currently impacting the reporting units. The market approach utilizes multiples of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The market multiples used for our reporting units were based on competitor industry data, along with the market multiples for the Company and other factors.
Finally, we compared our estimates of fair value to the consolidated Company’s October 2021 month-end total public market capitalization, which included factoring in the business operations that do not have goodwill, and assessed implied control premiums. The Company’s public market capitalization has significantly increased from October 2021 to December 31, 2021 given an increase in the Company’s stock price of approximately 28.5% during that time period. Based on the results of this analysis, we concluded that the estimated fair value determined under our approach for the annual goodwill impairment test for our France and Luxembourg reporting units was reasonable.
We concluded that the goodwill assigned to the France and Luxembourg reporting units as of October 2021 were not impaired, and that they continue to not be impaired as of December 31, 2021. However, the estimates and assumptions on which the Company’s evaluations are based involve judgments and are based on current available information, any of which could prove wrong or inaccurate when made, or become wrong or inaccurate as a result of subsequent events. In the event the business significantly under achieves its goals for revenue and profit growth in the future, the carrying value for this business unit may not be supportable using a discounted cash flow projection, and an impairment charge may exist. See “Fair Value” in footnote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Other Estimates
The Company has also made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of its assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the FASB, and other regulatory authorities. Such estimates primarily relate to the valuation of stock options for recording equity-based compensation expense, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, investment valuation, discount rates associated with pension plans, incurred but not reported healthcare claims, acquisition and related accounting, legal matters, and estimates of progress toward completion and direct profit or loss on contracts, as applicable. As future events and their effect on the Company's operating results cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in the economic climates in which the Company operates may affect these estimates and will be reflected in the Company’s financial statements in the event they occur.
Financial Condition and Liquidity
Cash provided by operating activities was $7.4 million, $30.7 million, and $8.5 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2021, net income was $13.7 million, while other non-cash adjustments, primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization expense, equity-based compensation, deferred income taxes, non-taxable life insurance gains, a gain from a sale of a building, impairment of capitalized software, and deferred compensation totaled $0.5 million. In 2020 and 2019, net income was $7.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, while the corresponding non-cash adjustments netted to $4.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
Accounts receivable balances increased $10.3 million in 2021 as compared with 2020, decreased $17.0 million in 2020 as compared with 2019, and increased $3.6 million in 2019 as compared with 2018. The increase in the accounts receivable balance in 2021 resulted from a large training, implementation, and support engagement for a health system in North America during the fourth quarter. Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) is calculated by dividing accounts receivable obtained from the consolidated balance sheet by average daily revenue for the fourth quarter of the respective year. DSO was 67 days at December 31, 2021 as compared with 74 days December 31, 2020. The decrease in DSO was primarily driven by the Company’s arrangement with its largest customer to factor outstanding receivables, which decreases the time of payment from 90 days to as little as 15 days based upon the Company’s direction. DSO was 74 days at December 31, 2020 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2019 of 85 days.
The cash surrender value of life insurance policies decreased $0.1 million in 2021, $0.7 million in 2020, and $1.0 million in 2019. The decrease in each of the years was due to normal appreciation of the existing cash surrender value of the outstanding policies at each respective point in time, which in turn was reduced by the benefits paid upon the death of two former executives in 2020. Accounts payable increased $2.9 million in 2021, decreased $0.6 million in 2020, and increased $3.9 million in 2019. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to the timing of certain payments near year-end, while the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the growth in the size of the Company and the timing of payments made near year-end. Accrued compensation increased $2.1 million in 2021 primarily due to the growth in the Company’s IT Solutions and Services and higher incentives for 2021 paid in the first quarter of 2022, and decreased $3.1 million in 2020 primarily due to the US operations reducing its payroll lag from two weeks in 2019 to one week during 2020. Accrued compensation increased $2.2 million in 2019 primarily due to significant growth in the Company’s operations and higher incentives for 2019 paid in the first quarter of 2020. Income taxes receivable decreased by $1.1 million in 2021 due to higher taxable income in 2021, and increased $1.3 million in 2020 due to a change in tax legislation which created a one-time benefit of approximately $1.1 million. Income taxes receivable increased $0.2 million in 2019 due to refunds received from the federal government and higher taxable income. Deferred payroll taxes decreased $3.2 million in 2021 and increased $6.7 million in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was due to the Company’s 2021 payment of a portion of the employer payroll taxes deferred under the CARES ACT in 2020. The increase in 2020 was due to the Company’s participation in a U.S. government program that allows companies under the CARES ACT to defer the payment of the employer portion of payroll taxes until 2021 and 2022. Advance billings increased $1.8 million in 2021, increased $1.3 million in 2020, and decreased $2.8 million in 2019. The change in advance billings in any given period is determined by the nature and type of existing projects, and the advance payments, if any, associated with those projects.
Investing activities used $2.5 million, $5.0 million, and $11.5 million of cash in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2020, cash paid for the acquisition of StarDust, net of cash acquired, was approximately $4.3 million. In 2019, net cash paid for the acquisition of Tech-IT totaled $8.5 million. The Company also used cash for additions to property, equipment and capitalized software of $1.9 million in 2021, $2.9 million in 2020, and $2.4 million in 2019. The Company expects the amount to be spent in 2022 on additions to property, equipment and capitalized software to be similar to the amount spent in 2021. The Company has no material commitments for future capital expenditures. During the 2020 second quarter, the Company sold its remaining owned real estate for $2.5 million. As the book value of the building was approximately $1.6 million, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $0.8 million, after fees. The Company paid premiums for life insurance totaling $0.5 million in 2021, and $0.6 million for life insurance in both 2020 and 2019. The Company received a total of $0.4 million of proceeds from life insurance policies upon the death of former executives in 2020.
Financing activities provided (used) $(1.1) million, $(5.7) million, and $1.8 million of cash in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net cash received (paid) under the Company’s revolving credit agreement was $0.0 million in 2021, $(5.3) million in 2020, and $1.7 million in 2019. Deferred debt costs were $1.2 million in 2021, which were costs associated with putting the new Credit Agreement in place in 2021. These deferred costs will be amortized over the term of the new Credit Agreement, or 60 months. Payments made to taxing authorities that represent the value of shares withheld for taxes in employee equity-based compensation transactions totaled $0.4 million in 2021, and $0.2 million in both 2020 and 2019. Cash overdrafts relate to the amount of outstanding checks at a point in time, and netted to $0.0 million, $(0.4) million, and less than $0.1 million in the 2021, 2020, and 2019 periods, respectively. No share purchases for treasury were made in 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, $7.7 million was available under the Company's authorization to purchase shares in future periods. The Company recorded $0.4 million, $0.0 million, and less than $0.1 million during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, from the proceeds from stock option exercises.
No dividends were paid in 2021, 2020, or 2019, and the Company does not currently foresee making a dividend payment in the future.
The new Credit Agreement has a five-year term that expires in May 2026. Under this Credit Agreement, the Company can borrow up to $50.0 million depending on collateral availability. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by the Company’s accounts receivable in the United States, Belgium and Luxembourg. Interest rates range from 1.5% to
2.0% over LIBOR or EURIBOR loans, and 0.5% to 1.0% over base rate (prime rate) loans. The London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our Credit Agreement, began being phased out at the beginning of calendar year 2022, with the one-month LIBOR, which we utilize as a reference rate, scheduled to cease immediately after June 30, 2023. A reference rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), and other alternative benchmark rates, are replacing LIBOR. The Company can borrow under the agreement at either rate at its discretion. The Company’s previous Credit and Security Agreement was terminated during the 2021 second quarter.
At both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement or the Company’s previous Credit and Security Agreement, respectively. The Company borrows or repays its debts as needed based upon its working capital obligations, including the timing of the U.S. bi-weekly payroll. There were no borrowings during 2021. The maximum amounts outstanding under its previous Credit and Security Agreement in 2020 was $12.0 million, while the average amount outstanding was $6.4 million, and carried a weighted average interest rate of 1.9%. Total commitment fees incurred totaled approximately $0.2 million in 2020 and $0.3 million in 2019, while interest paid in 2020 and 2019 totaled $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to meet one financial covenant in order to maintain borrowings under its revolving credit line, pay dividends, and make acquisitions. The covenant is measured quarterly, and at December 31, 2021 represented a fixed charge coverage ratio, where for the trailing twelve months the consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for, amongst other items, equity-based compensation and severance expenses, must be greater than 1.0 times the consolidated interest expense paid in cash and any scheduled principal payments. The fixed charge coverage ratio is only tested if availability, subject to a maximum of the commitment of $50.0 million, on the measurement date is less than the greater of 12.5% of the total loan availability or $5.0 million. Actual borrowings by CTG under the Credit Agreement are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based on certain eligible receivables and reserves for each country included in the Credit Agreement (the United States, Belgium, and Luxembourg). Receivable balances from our largest client, IBM, have been removed from the Credit Agreement as collateral, as the Company had entered into a factoring arrangement for those receivables. See “Accounts Receivable Factoring” in footnote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Total availability as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $44.7 million. The Company’s compliance with its financial covenant was not required to be tested at December 31, 2021 as the availability under the Credit Agreement was in excess of 12.5% of the total loan availability. The Company was in compliance with its applicable covenants under the previous Credit and Security Agreement at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Of the total cash and cash equivalents reported on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 of $35.6 million, approximately $24.8 million is held by the Company’s foreign operations and is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in those operations. The Company has not repatriated any of its cash and cash equivalents from its foreign operations in the past five years, and has no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future as the funds are generally required to meet the working capital needs of its foreign operations.
At December 31, 2021, the Company believes existing internally available funds, cash potentially generated from future operations, and funds potentially available under the Company's revolving line of credit (subject to collateral limits) totaling $49.8 million, will be sufficient to meet foreseeable working capital and capital expenditure needs, fund stock repurchases, fund acquisitions, pay a dividend (if any), and allow for future internal growth and expansion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company did not have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions in 2021, 2020, and 2019 other than guarantees in our European operations which support office leases and performance under government contracts. These guarantees totaled approximately $3.1 million at December 31, 2021. Also, the Company has purchase obligations in 2022, 2023, and 2024 for certain software, recruiting and other services totaling $1.9 million.
