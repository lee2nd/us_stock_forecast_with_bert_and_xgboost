Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and financing needs, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system, or CNS, disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance. Normal brain function requires a delicate balance of excitation and inhibition in neuronal circuits, which, when dysregulated, can lead to abnormal function and disease. We are applying insights from genetic epilepsies to both rare and more prevalent neurological and psychiatric disorders, using our understanding of shared biological targets and circuits in the brain. We apply a deliberate and pragmatic precision approach, leveraging a suite of translational tools including novel transgenic and predictive translational animal models and electrophysiology markers, to enable an efficient path to proof-of-concept in patients. Through this approach, we have established a broad CNS portfolio with multiple programs, including product candidates across psychiatric disorders, movement disorders, epilepsy and other exploratory CNS indications, with three clinical-stage product candidates. Each of our clinical-stage product candidates is advancing in more than one indication and we anticipate expansion into additional indications. We expect multiple topline readouts from our clinical-stage programs and anticipate the launch of a fourth clinical development program in 2022. In addition, we have established a robust pipeline of preclinical stage programs through internal research and in-licensing.
Our broad portfolio of CNS programs is currently structured by therapeutic focus in three primary franchises - Psychiatry, Movement Disorders and Epilepsy. In addition, we are pursuing development in other exploratory CNS indications such as rare adult cephalgias. Within our Psychiatry franchise, our most advanced clinical candidate, PRAX-114, is being developed for the treatment of a broad range of patients suffering from major depressive disorder, or MDD, and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. We expect to report topline results from the Aria Study, a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study evaluating PRAX-114 for monotherapy treatment of MDD, in the second quarter of 2022. We also expect to report topline results from the Acapella Study, a Phase 2, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study evaluating PRAX-114 for treatment of MDD, in mid-2022. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 2, placebo-controlled study evaluating PRAX-114 for the treatment of PTSD and expect to report topline results in the second half of 2022.
Within our Movement Disorders franchise, our second clinical candidate, PRAX-944, is being developed for the treatment of Essential Tremor, or ET, and Parkinson's Disease, or PD. We anticipate reporting topline results from the second cohort of our ongoing Phase 2a trial evaluating PRAX-944 for the treatment of ET in the second quarter of 2022, including both open-label and placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period results. We have initiated a Phase 2b placebo-controlled, dose-range finding trial, the Essential1 Study, to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of PRAX-944 in adults with ET and we expect to report topline results in the second half of 2022. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and efficacy of daytime dosing of PRAX-114 for the treatment of ET in the first quarter of 2022 and expect to report topline results in the second half of 2022. We expect to initiate a Phase 2, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, PK and efficacy of PRAX-944 as a non-dopaminergic treatment for the motor symptoms of PD in the second quarter of 2022.
Within our Epilepsy franchise, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study with our third clinical-stage candidate, PRAX-562, in the second quarter of 2022 in patients with rare pediatric Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies. Our most advanced preclinical stage product candidate within our Epilepsy franchise, PRAX-222, is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, designed to decrease the expression levels of the protein encoded by the gene SCN2A in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. We expect to initiate a seamless study of PRAX-222 in the second quarter of 2022, which would be our fourth program to reach clinical stage. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating PRAX-562 in patients with rare adult
cephalgias in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, our preclinical pipeline consists of a discovery program in development for KCNT1 related epilepsy, PRAX-628, a product candidate nominated in the fourth quarter of 2021 for focal epilepsy, three ASOs targeting SCN2A in patients with loss-of-function mutations, PCDH19 and SYNGAP1, respectively, and three additional discovery programs for undisclosed targets in psychiatry, movement disorders and epilepsy.
We were incorporated in 2015 and commenced operations in 2016. Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our preclinical and clinical product candidates, building our intellectual property, or IP, portfolio, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We employ a “virtual” research and development model, relying heavily upon external consultants, collaborators and contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our preclinical and clinical activities. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale and issuance of equity securities.
On May 18, 2021, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.25 per share, including 750,000 shares of common stock issued and sold pursuant to the underwriters' exercise, in full, of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of $104.9 million. We received approximately $98.4 million in net proceeds after deducting discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
On November 3, 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement, or the sales agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of $125.0 million of common stock from time to time in at-the-market offerings for which Jefferies acts as sales agent. As of December 31, 2021, we issued and sold 391,997 shares under the sales agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of $7.6 million. We received approximately $7.0 million of net proceeds after deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
We are a development stage company and we have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not expect to do so for several years, if at all. All of our product candidates are still in preclinical and clinical development. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, if approved. We have incurred recurring operating losses since inception, including net losses of $167.1 million and $61.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $316.6 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development activities. In addition, our losses from operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•advance our lead product candidates, PRAX-114 and PRAX-944, to late stage clinical trials;
•advance our PRAX-562 product candidate to Phase 2 clinical trials;
•advance our PRAX-222 product candidate to clinical trials;
•advance our preclinical candidates to clinical trials;
•further invest in our pipeline;
•further invest in our manufacturing capabilities;
•seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;
•maintain, expand, protect and defend our IP portfolio;
•acquire or in-license technology;
•secure facilities to support continued growth in our research, development and commercialization efforts;
•take temporary precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees; and
•increase our headcount to support our development efforts and to expand our clinical development team.
In addition, as we progress toward marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $275.9 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the second quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
COVID-19 Business Update
In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to experience some disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those third parties upon whom we rely. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical studies as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions and redirection of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the enrollment of some of our ongoing clinical trials, including slower patient enrollment and treatment in some of our clinical studies, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and program, but none of which have significantly impacted our overall clinical trial timelines. While we have experienced limited financial impacts to date, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic such as increased inflation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as we evolve our business continuity plans, clinical development plans and response strategy.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years, if at all. If our development efforts for our current or future product candidates are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
The nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following:
•costs to develop our portfolio;
•discovery efforts leading to development candidates;
•clinical development costs for our product candidates; and
•costs to develop our manufacturing technology and infrastructure.
The costs above comprise the following categories:
•personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;
•expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, investigative sites and CROs, that conduct our preclinical and clinical studies and in-licensing arrangements;
•costs incurred to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements;
•costs incurred with third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations to acquire, develop and manufacture materials for preclinical and clinical studies; and
•depreciation, amortization and other direct and allocated expenses, including rent, insurance and other operating costs, incurred as a result of our research and development activities.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as prepaid expenses or accrued expenses. Non-refundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs. We track direct external research and development expenses to specific franchises and product candidates upon commencement. Due to the number of ongoing studies and our ability to use resources across several projects, indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development franchises, such as personnel, facility costs and certain consulting costs, are not recorded or maintained on a franchise-specific basis.
The following table reflects our research and development expenses, including direct expenses summarized by major franchise and other exploratory CNS indications and indirect or shared operating costs recognized as research and development expenses during each period presented (in thousands):
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through the development phase, and as we continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, build manufacturing capabilities and expand into additional therapeutic areas.
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of:
•our ability to add and retain key research and development personnel;
•the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•the number and scope of our preclinical and clinical product candidates we decide to pursue;
•our ability to successfully complete clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates;
•our successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations;
•our ability to discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and the impact on disease progression of our product candidates;
•our ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;
•the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;
•our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other IP protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, if approved;
•our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•our ability to commercialize products, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•the continued acceptable safety profiles of any product candidates following approval.
A change in any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time to complete our clinical development activities. We may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The drug commercialization of any of our product candidates, if ever, will take several years and require significant development costs.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, commercial and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for office rent and other operating costs. These costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual franchise or product candidate. Costs to secure and defend our IP are expensed as incurred and are classified as general and administrative expenses.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional IP-related expenses as we file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development activities.
Other Income
Other Income, Net
Other income, net consists of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and amortization of investment premiums and discounts.
Income Taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards which may be available to offset future taxable income and which begin to expire in 2035. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and which begin to expire in 2031.
Income taxes are determined at the applicable tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits and other permanent differences. Our income tax provision may be significantly affected by changes to our estimates. There was no income tax benefit (provision) recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021. The income tax benefit recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not material.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for each period presented (in thousands):
Research and Development Expense
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for each period presented, along with the changes in those items (in thousands):
The $75.3 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the following:
•$17.6 million increase in personnel-related costs due to increased headcount, driven primarily by an increase of $8.0 million in stock-based compensation expense;
•$16.1 million increase in expense related to our psychiatry franchise, driven primarily by an increase in clinical-related and toxicology spend for our PRAX-114 Phase 2/3 Aria and Acapella clinical trials;
•$13.2 million increase in expense related to our epilepsy franchise, driven primarily by an increase in clinical-related and toxicology spend to support the initiation of our PRAX-562 Phase 2 developmental epileptic encephalopathies clinical trial and an increase in preclinical activities for our earlier stage assets;
•$14.3 million increase in expense related to our movement disorders franchise, driven primarily by an increase in toxicology and clinical-related spend for our PRAX-944 Phase 2 Essential1 clinical trial;
•$8.8 million increase in other exploratory CNS indications, driven primarily by an increase in clinical-related expenses for our PRAX-562 Phase 2 trial in Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks, Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache with Autonomic symptoms and Trigeminal Neuralgia, as well as increased preclinical activities for our earlier stage assets; and
•$5.3 million increase in other indirect research and development expenses, driven primarily by an increase in general clinical related spend, as well as increases in facility and other allocated overhead costs and technology spend and related consulting costs to support our clinical and quality operations.
General and Administrative Expense
The $30.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the following:
•$14.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, driven primarily by increased headcount, including an increase of $9.5 million in stock-based compensation expense;
•$9.9 million increase in professional fees, driven primarily by $5.1 million of increased commercial-related spend to support market assessments of our clinical-stage programs, a $2.2 million increase in audit and legal fees and a $1.7 million increase in general and administrative infrastructure-related costs; and
•$5.6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, driven primarily by a $3.5 million increase in insurance and related costs due to our first full year as a public company, a $0.8 million increase in technology spend and a $0.7 million increase in donations and sponsorships.
Other Income
Other income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was comprised of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and investment premium and discount amortization.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses in each period. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all.
To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale and issuance of equity securities. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have raised $516.4 million in aggregate cash proceeds from such transactions, net of issuance costs. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $275.9 million.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for each period presented (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operating activities are greatly influenced by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital requirements to support the business. We have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we have invested in developing our portfolio, drug discovery efforts and related infrastructure. The cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which are primarily the result of increased expenses and timing of vendor payments.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities of $124.6 million was primarily due to our $167.1 million net loss, partially offset by $26.4 million of non-cash charges primarily related to stock-based compensation, amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities and non-cash operating lease expense, and $16.1 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities of $52.6 million was primarily due to our $61.8 million net loss, partially offset by $6.0 million of non-cash charges primarily related to stock-based compensation and $3.2 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to an increase in accrued expenses.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities of $140.5 million primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the maturity of marketable securities. There were no cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities of $107.6 million consisted of net proceeds from our follow-on public offering and at-the-market offerings of $105.7 million and net proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.4 million partially offset by the payment of issuance costs for our initial public offering, or IPO.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities of $304.4 million primarily consisted of net proceeds from our IPO and from the issuance of our Series C and Series C-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock, partially offset by our repurchase of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Plan of Operation and Future Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing research and development activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and as we transition from being an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company. As a result, we expect to incur substantial operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•advance the clinical development of our clinical-stage product candidates within our psychiatry, movement disorders and epilepsy franchises, respectively;
•advance the development of any additional product candidates;
•conduct research and continue preclinical development of potential product candidates;
•make strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities;
•maintain our IP portfolio and opportunistically acquire complementary IP;
•seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
•potentially establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts and to support our operations as a public company; and
•experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges.
We are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements, but based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and potential collaborations with third parties for the development of our product candidates, we may incorrectly estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our funding requirements and timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our franchises and product candidates;
•the number and characteristics of product candidates and technologies that we develop or may in-license;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, if any, for products in the United States and other jurisdictions, and the costs of post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where approval is obtained;
•the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our IP rights and defending any IP-related claims;
•the continuation of our existing licensing arrangements and entry into new collaborations and licensing arrangements;
•the costs we incur in maintaining business operations;
•the costs associated with being a public company;
•the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the effect of competing technological and market developments;
•the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of our manufacturers, suppliers or other vendors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crisis; and
•the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates, although we currently have no commitments or agreements to complete any such acquisitions or investments in businesses.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially result in dilution to the holders of our common stock.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates to third parties that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have entered into certain agreements under which we have incurred or may in the future incur obligations and commitments that could have a material impact on our capital resources.
We sublease building space in Boston, Massachusetts. Our sublease will expire on January 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2021, our operating lease commitments for the remainder of the lease term were $5.2 million.
In addition, we have entered into collaboration and license agreements with Purdue Neuroscience Company, or Purdue, RogCon Inc., or RogCon, and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, under which we could be obligated to pay certain fees, milestone payments and cost reimbursements.
Under our license agreement with Purdue, we are obligated to make future milestone payments of up to $33.0 million based on the achievement of specified development and sales milestones. Furthermore, we are obligated to pay Purdue royalties of a low-single-digit percentage of annual net sales of licensed products. Either party may terminate the license agreement for convenience or in the event of a material breach by the other party and failure to cure such breach within a certain period of time. If the agreement is voluntarily terminated by Purdue, our license rights will survive such termination and such rights will become fully paid, perpetual and irrevocable. See “Business-License Agreements-License Agreement with Purdue.”
Under our license agreement with RogCon, we are obligated to reimburse RogCon for its out-of-pocket costs incurred for activities performed under the license agreement. Additionally, we may be obligated to pay RogCon a milestone payment of $3.0 million and profit share payments. The $3.0 million milestone payment is due when the first profit share payment has become due and payable and certain contingent payments have become due and payable to Ionis under our collaboration agreement with Ionis. The profit share payments are based on a low-double-digit percentage of net profits, depending on sales volume. Either party may terminate the license agreement for material breach or insolvency of the other party. Additionally, we may terminate for convenience with prior notice to RogCon. See “Business-License Agreements-License Agreement with RogCon.”
Under our collaboration agreement with Ionis, we are obligated to reimburse any out-of-pocket costs incurred by Ionis related to research activities, identification of a development candidate and conducting an investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling toxicology study. Ionis granted us an exclusive option to obtain the rights and license to further develop and commercialize a development candidate in the field of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders, other than Dravet Syndrome, following the results of the IND-enabling toxicology study. We exercised this exclusive option in January 2022 and paid a $2.0 million license fee. We may be required
to make additional payments to Ionis including development milestone payments, additional milestone payments and sales royalties or sublicense fees. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement upon material breach or insolvency of the other party. Ionis may terminate if we fail to achieve a performance milestone. See “Business-License Agreements-Ionis Collaboration Agreement.”
We have also entered into multiple agreements with third parties under which we may be obligated to make future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments on future sales of specified product candidates. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of such milestones and sales. When the achievement of these milestones or sales have not occurred, such contingencies are not recorded in our financial statements.
We have agreements with certain vendors for various services, including services related to clinical operations and support, for which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the vendors. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated.
In addition, we enter into indemnification agreements and agreements containing indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our business collaborators, in connection with any U.S. patent or any copyright or other IP infringement claim by any third party with respect to our product candidates. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual upon execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements cannot be reasonably estimated.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.
Research and Development Expenses and Related Accruals and Prepaids
Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of research and development activities, including personnel-related expenses such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; materials; supplies; manufacturing and external costs related to outside vendors engaged to conduct both preclinical studies and clinical trials; and the allocable portions of facility costs, such as rent, utilities, depreciation and general support services. All costs associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued and prepaid research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates in determining our accrued and prepaid research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us
at that time. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses, we analyze progress of the studies or trials related to these services, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Examples of estimated accrued and prepaid research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•CROs in connection with performing research services and preclinical and clinical studies;
•investigative sites or other providers in connection with preclinical and clinical studies;
•vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.
The financial terms of our agreements with CROs are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of milestones. In expensing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the expense accordingly. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued and prepaid research and development expenses at the end of any reporting period. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
