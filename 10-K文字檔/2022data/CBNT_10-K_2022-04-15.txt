Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Our Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this Report. You should review the disclosure under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a nanotechnology company and sole owner, developer, and manufacturer of the patented C-Bond technology. We are engaged in the implementation of proprietary nanotechnology applications and processes to enhance properties of strength, functionality, and sustainability of brittle material systems. Our present primary focus is in the multi-billion-dollar glass and window film industry with target markets in the United States and internationally. We operate in two divisions: C-Bond Transportation Solutions and Patriot Glass Solutions. C-Bond Transportation Solutions sells a windshield strengthening, water repellent solution called C-Bond nanoShield™ as well as a disinfection product. Patriot Glass Solutions sells multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solutions, including C-Bond BRS, a ballistic-resistant film system, and C-Bond Secure, a forced entry system.
To date, we have filed, licensed and/or acquired a total of 23 individual patents and patent applications spanning core and strategic nano-technology applications and processes. Our intellectual property portfolio was recently valued at $33.7 million by a leading, independent, global intellectual property valuation firm. The IP valuation firm’s review covered the valuation of our intangible assets including our developed technology, trade name, customer relationships, and assembled workforce, and the Company’s determination of the fair value or other amounts of any assets and liabilities including current assets, real property, personal property, and current liabilities. Our developed technology includes C-Bond nanoShield, C-Bond Secure, and C-Bond BRS. The valuation firm also reviewed historical and projected financial information for the Company giving consideration to general economic and industry trends.
On May 20, 2020, we entered into a two-year Distributor Agreement with an entity where we were appointed as a distributor to exclusively sell MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets for use in certain markets. In February 2022, we and the entity amended the Distributor Agreement to include the sale of Vimoba Tablets in those same markets and extended the term of the Distributor Agreement for another year. MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets are the most convenient way yet to deliver the benefits of chlorine dioxide to hygiene or biosafety programs. MB-10 disinfectant tablets have one of the broadest, most complete EPA registration labels on the market. It is a safe, easy and effective way to disinfect a vehicle’s interior using an EPA registered disinfectant (Reg No.70060-19-46269) included on List N for use against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It is proven effective against emerging viral pathogens, including enveloped and large and small non-enveloped viruses. MB-10 Tablets provide fast-acting virus and bacteria protection that is safe for all vehicle surfaces including LED screens and electronics without leaving a residue or odor. Vimoba Tablets are 100% non-corrosive, chlorine dioxide producing tablets that maintain the exact same efficacy, EPA Label claims, dilution rates and contact times as MB-10 Tablets, while including a buffering agent that makes the Vimoba solution completely non-corrosive on stainless steel - even after prolonged use or exposure - and even when the solution dries on the surface. We were appointed as a distributor to exclusively sell MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets and Vimoba Tablets for use in the following markets:
● Automotive, Trucking, RV, rental agencies (auto and truck), service vehicles (taxi, Uber, Lyft), mass transit (train, buses), golf carts, aviation, train, marine (potential future growth)
● School facilities and buses
● Dealerships
● Global Distribution
● Service Providers
● Transportation Detailing.
On June 30, 2021, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Mobile Tint LLC, a Texas limited liability company doing business as A1 Glass Coating (“Mobile”), (ii) the sole member of Mobile (the “Mobile Member”), and (iii) Michael Wanke as the Representative of the Mobile Member. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we agreed to acquire 80% of Mobile’s member units, representing 80% of Mobile’s issued and outstanding capital stock (the “Mobile Member Units”). On July 22, 2021, we closed the Exchange Agreement and acquired 80% of the Mobile Shares. The Mobile Member Units were exchanged for restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, in an amount equal to $800,000, divided by the average of the closing prices of the Company’s common stock during the 30-day period immediately prior to the closing as defined in the Exchange Agreement. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, we issued 28,021,016 shares of its common stock. Two years after closing, we have the option to acquire the remaining 20% of Mobile’s issued and outstanding membership interests in exchange for a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to 300% of Mobile’s average EBIT value, divided by the price of the Company’s common stock as defined in the Exchange Agreement (the “Additional Closing”). Mobile provides quality window tint solutions for auto, home, and business owners across Texas, specializing in automotive window tinting, residential window film, and commercial window film that stop harmful UV rays from passing through its window films for reduced glare, comfortable temperatures, and lower energy bills. Mobile also carry products that offer forced-entry protection and films that protect glass from scratches, graffiti, other types of vandalism, and even bullets, including our C-Bond BRS and C-Bond Secure products. As part of the transaction, Mobile’s owner-operator, Michael Wanke, joined the Company as President of its Safety Patriot Glass Solutions Group. Mobile has been in business for more than 30 years and produced annual revenue of approximately $2 million in both 2019 and 2020. As part of the transaction, Mobile’s owner-operator, Michael Wanke, has agreed to join us as President of our Patriot Glass Solutions group.
Our recent acquisition of Mobile will be the springboard to provide glass security solutions across the United States. We recently launched Patriot Glass Solutions to protect personal and business property across the United States using C-Bond’s proprietary glass strengthening technology to protects property from looting, rioting, break-ins, and gunfire. With our recent acquisition of Mobile, we are re-branding our Safety Solutions Group as “Patriot Glass Solutions.” Patriot Glass Solutions’ primary products include C-Bond BRS, a ballistic-resistant film system; and C-Bond Secure, a multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solution that deters forced entry.
The following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our consolidated financial statements contained in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.
Operating Overview
We are a nanotechnology company and sole owner, developer, and manufacturer of the patented C-Bond technology. We are engaged in the implementation of proprietary nanotechnology applications and processes to enhance properties of strength, functionality, and sustainability of brittle material systems. Our present primary focus is in the multi-billion-dollar glass and window film industry with target markets in the United States and internationally. We operate in two divisions: C-Bond Transportation Solutions and Patriot Glass Solutions. C-Bond Transportation Solutions, which sells a windshield strengthening, water repellent solution called C-Bond nanoShield™ as well as a disinfection product. , and Patriot Glass Solutions, which sells multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solutions, including C-Bond BRS, a ballistic-resistant film systems, and C-Bond Secure, a forced entry system. The C-Bond technology enables ordinary glass to dissipate energy by permeating the glass surface and detecting microscopic flaws and defects that are randomly distributed all over the glass surface. C-Bond’s unique qualities then work to locate and repair the identified surface imperfections that weaken the glass composite structure and ultimately act as failure initiators. The C-Bond formula is engineered to maintain original glass design integrity while increasing the mechanical performance properties of the glass unit. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we created partnerships to distribute disinfection related products, which we began to sell in the second quarter of 2020. The Company currently sells MB-10 Tablets® and Vimoba® Tablets.
Revenue is generated by the sale of products through distributors and directly to dealers. C-Bond nanoShield and disinfection sales are generated through distribution channels. Sales of C-Bond Secure are made primarily to window film dealers who offer the product as an upsell during installation. Revenue is generated from the sale of C-Bond BRS on a project basis. C-Bond BRS is specified into project plans providing authorized installers a competitive advantage.
Additionally, through the acquisition of 80% of Mobile Tint, LLC, we now provide quality window tint solutions for auto, home, and business owners across Texas, specializing in automotive window tinting, residential window film, and commercial window film that stop harmful UV rays from passing through its window films for reduced glare, comfortable temperatures, and lower energy bills. Mobile also carries products that offer forced-entry protection and films that protect glass from scratches, graffiti, other types of vandalism, and even bullets, including our C-Bond BRS and C-Bond Secure products.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $7,128,858 and $4,434,443 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which included stock-based compensation of $4,085,868 and $1,498,810 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net cash used in operations was $1,807,051 and $1,783,027 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, shareholders’ deficit, and working capital deficit of $57,515,129, $3,979,041 and $1,661,247, respectively, on December 31, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. The Company is seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future. Although the Company has historically raised capital from sales of common shares, preferred shares and from the issuance of convertible and other promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the global economy. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that have originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may have a long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industry. For example, the pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the COVID-19 virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. While these measures may be relaxed or revised in some areas, there is no guarantee these measures will not be reinstated or resumed due to additional variants of COVID-19 or the inability or ineffectiveness of public health measures to limit the further spread of COVID-19. These measures may adversely impact our employees and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners. These measures by government authorities, or the risks that the measures may be reinstated or resumed, may remain in place for a significant period of time and may adversely affect building plans, sales and marketing activities, business and results of operations. As a result, our customers may delay the ordering of products, and delayed entering into contracts for the delivery and installation of window film, and have delayed payment of balances due to the Company. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount of $31,556 and $99,911, respectively, which is primarily based on our assessment of specific identifiable overdue customer accounts located in India and the Philippines. The lack of collection of these accounts receivable balances, which we believe was attributable to COVID-19, had a material impact on the cash flows of the Company. We cannot estimate the duration of the pandemic and the future impact on our business. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the Company’s business, including weakened demand for its products and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Currently, we are unable to estimate the impact of this event on our operations.
Restatement of 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements
On April 11, 2022, the Company determined that the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) should be restated because management determined that it had overstated its sales and bad debt expense in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”). Based on management’s analysis, the Company determined that a sale in the amount of $102,569 that was recorded in December 2020 did not meet the Company’s revenue recognition policy pursuant to ASC 606 and should not have been reflected as a sale. Additionally, in the same period, in connection with the Company’s analysis of collectability, the Company recorded a bad debt allowance and a related bad debt expense of $102,569. Since the sale and related allowance for bad debt should not have been recorded, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2020 to reduce sales and bad debt expense by $102,569. There was no effect on the Company’s reported net loss for Fiscal 2020 or on the financial condition of the Company at December 31, 2020. Nevertheless, such restatement may have caused, or could in the future cause, investors in our securities to lose confidence in our financial statements and management, which could result in a decrease in our stock price and negative sentiment in the investment community.
The Company included the restated results for Fiscal 2020 in an amendment to the 2020 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2022 and herein. After re-evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that that a material weakness existed in its revenue recognition during Fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of personnel who are no longer with the Company. The Company has taken remedial action to ensure this does not occur in the future.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management continually evaluates such estimates, including those related to estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable, the estimates for obsolete inventory, estimated used in the calculation of percentage of completion on uncompleted jobs, purchase price allocation of acquired businesses, the useful life of property and equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, the estimate of the fair value of the right of use asset and lease liability, the valuation of redeemable and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, the fair value of derivative liabilities, the value of beneficial conversion features, and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Segment reporting
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated in one reportable business segment, which consisted of the manufacture and sale of a windshield strengthening water repellent solution as well as a disinfection product, and the sale of multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solutions, including ballistic-resistant film systems and a forced entry system. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we operated in two reportable business segments - (1) the manufacture and sale of a windshield strengthening water repellent solution as well as a disinfection product, and the sale of multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solutions, including ballistic-resistant film systems and a forced entry system, and (2) the sale and installation of window film solutions. The Company’s reportable segments were strategic business units that offered different products. They were managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations and locations.
Accounts receivable
The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging, and expected future write-offs, as well as an assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized as general and administrative expense.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting of raw materials and finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value utilizing the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. A reserve is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected net realizable value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, the Company will record reserves for the difference between the cost and the net realizable value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates and included in cost of sales.
Revenue recognition
We follow Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). This standard establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and requires certain additional disclosures.
We sell our products which include standard warranties primarily to distributors and authorized dealers. Product sales are recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred and are recorded net of any discounts or allowances. The warranty does not represent a separate performance obligation.
Revenues from contracts for the distribution and installation of window film solutions are recognized over time on the basis of the Company’s estimates of the progress towards completion of contracts using various output or input methods depending on the type of contract terms including (1) the ratio of number of labor hours spent compared to the number of estimated labor hours to complete a job, (2) using the milestone method, or (3) using a units completed method. These methods are used because management considers these to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. We use the same method for similar types of contracts. The asset, “contract assets” represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, “contract liabilities,” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - “Compensation -Stock Compensation”, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements.
Results of Operations
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The results discussed below are for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Sales
For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales amounted to $1,476,828 as compared to $555,863 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $920,965, or 165.7%. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 80% of Mobile on July 22, 2021 which generated sales of $1,042,017 from the acquisition date (July 22, 2021) to December 31, 2021, an increase in C-Bond nanoShield solution sales of $104,918, an increase in sales of C-Bond ballistic resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond Secure window film application solution of $28,669, and an increase in sale of installation and other services of $3,151, offset by a decrease in disinfectant product of $242,902, and a decrease in freight and delivery revenue of $14,888. The increase in sales of C-Bond ballistic resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond Secure window film application solution was primarily due to an increase in both domestic sales resulting from the gradual reopening of economies from COVID-19 restrictions and sales efforts.
Cost of Goods Sold
In connection with our C-Bond Solutions segment, cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of cost of raw materials and finished inventory sold, packaging costs, and warranty costs. In connection with our Mobile segment, cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of cost of raw materials such as film, labor, subcontractor costs, equipment rental, and supplies.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of sales amounted to $657,298 as compared to $242,506 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $414,792, or 171,0%. The increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 80% of Mobile on July 22, 2021 which generated cost of sales of $518,700 from the acquisition date (July 22, 2021) to December 31, 2021. This increase was offset by a decrease in cost of sales of C-Bond nanoShield solution, C-Bond ballistic resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond Secure window film application solution and disinfectant products due to a decrease in sales.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross profit amounted to $819,530, or 55.5% of sales, as compared to $313,357, or 56.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $506,173, or 161.5%. This increase in gross profits is primarily attributable to the acquisition of 80% of Mobile Tint, LLC on July 22, 2021, which generated gross profit of $482,092, or 46.3% from acquisition date (July 22, 2021) to December 31, 2021, and an increase in gross profits related to an increase in sales of C-Bond nanoShield solution, C-Bond ballistic resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond Secure window film application solution, and a decrease in sales of disinfectant products. Generally, we recognize a higher gross profit percentage on the sale of C-bond nanoShield and C-bond ballistic resistant glass protections systems than we do on the sale of disinfection products and from Mobile Tint installations and services.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating expenses amounted to $7,829,649 as compared to $4,790,390 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3,039,259, or 63.4%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating expenses consisted of the following:
Compensation and related benefits
For the year ended December 31, 2021, compensation and related benefits increased by $2,423,955, or 64.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $1,977,396 and an increase in compensation and related benefits of $446,559, which was attributable to an increase in compensation and related benefits of $216,177 from the acquisition of Mobile Tint, and an increase in compensation to C-Bond employees during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $230,382 primarily attributable to an increase in bonuses and an increase in executive compensation.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation related to the accretion of stock-option expense amounted to $0 and $609,662, respectively, and other stock-based compensation amounted to $4,085,868 and $2,108,472, respectively, an aggregate increase of $1,977,396. On January 18, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company agreed to satisfy $295,000 of accrued compensation owed to its executive officers and former executive officer (collectively, the “Management”) through a Liability Reduction Plan (the “Plan”). Under this Plan, Management agreed to accept 295 shares of the Company’s Series B convertible preferred stock in settlement of accrued compensation. The conversion feature of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time of issuance was determined to be beneficial on the commitment date. Because the Series B Preferred Stock was perpetual with no stated maturity date, and the conversions could occur any time from the date of issuance, the Company immediately recorded non-cash stock-based compensation of $3,778,810 related to the beneficial conversion feature arising from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock.
Research and development
Research and development expenses (recovery) consist primarily of contracted development services, third party testing laboratories, materials used and allocated overhead expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expense decreased by $19,877, or 119.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in research and development expense is primarily related to a receipt of a refund of previous research and development costs of $3,250 and a decrease in use of contracted development services due a lack of working capital.
Professional fees
For the year ended December 31, 2021, professional fees increased by $484,561, or 88.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase primarily related to an increase in legal fees of $164,559, an increase in accounting fees of $40,137, an increase in consulting fee of $285,479, offset by a decrease in other professional fees of $5,614. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, stock-based consulting fees amounted to $478,129 and $132,892, respectively, an increase of $345,237, primarily attributable to an increase to common shares issued to an entity for investor relations services.
General and administrative
For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses increased by $150,620, or 31.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 80% of Mobile that incurred general and administrative expenses of $174,914, an increase in advertising expense of $16,302 and an increase in other general and administrative expenses of $54,044, offset by a decrease in bad debt expense incurred of $60,556, and a decrease in shipping and handling expenses of $34,084.
Loss from Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2021, loss from operations increased by $2,533,086, or 56.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income (Expenses), net
For the year ended December 31, 2021, other (expense) income, net amounted to $(118,739) as compared $42,590 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a change of $161,329, or 378.8%. This change was due to a decrease in derivative expense of $90,623 attributable to the recording of derivative liabilities related to convertible debt during the 2020 period, and a decrease in interest expense of $468,225 related to a decrease in the amortization of debt discount and a decrease in interest-bearing debt, offset by a decrease in gain on debt extinguishment of $781,381. Additionally, during the 2021 period, we recognized other income of $67,778 related to receipt of insurance proceeds for storm damage, as compared to $6,574 in other income during the 2020 period.
Net Loss
Due to factors discussed above, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net loss amounted to $7,128,858 and $4,434,443, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net loss attributable to common shareholders, which included a deemed dividend related to price protection, beneficial conversion features on preferred stock, and the dividends accrued on Series B and C preferred stock of $4,401,907 and the deduction of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $15,525, amounted to $11,546,290, or $(0.05) per basic and diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net loss attributable to common shareholders, which included a deemed dividend related to price protection, beneficial conversion features on preferred stock, and the dividends accrued on Series B and C preferred stock of $1,534,381, amounted to $5,968,824, or $(0.03) per basic and diluted common share.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had cash of $519,898 and $323,407 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our primary uses of cash have been for compensation and related benefits, fees paid to third parties for professional services, and general and administrative expenses. We have received funds from the sales of products and from various financing activities such as from the sale of our common shares, from the sale of preferred shares and from debt financings. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near to long term:
● An increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business,
● Research and development fees;
● Addition of administrative and sales personnel needed for business growth;
● The cost of being a public company;
● Marketing expense for building brand;
● Capital requirements for production capacity.
● Working capital requirements to support acquired companies.
Since inception, we have raised proceeds from the sale of common shares and preferred shares, and from debt to fund our operations and research and development initiatives.
On February 24, 2021, we entered into a subscription agreement with an accredited investor whereby the investor agreed to purchase 2,500 shares of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock for $250,000, or $100.00 per share, the stated value, which were used from working capital purposes. The conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock at the time of issuance was determined to be beneficial on the commitment date. Because the Series C Preferred Stock was perpetual with no stated maturity date, and the conversions could occur any time from the date of issuance, we immediately recorded a non-cash deemed dividend of $2,845,238 related to the beneficial conversion feature arising from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock.
On May 10, 2021, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) and a Secured Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the amount of $500,000 with a lender. The Note shall accrue interest at 8% per annum, compounded annually, and all outstanding principal and accrued interest is due and payable of May 10, 2023. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement and the Note are secured by a second priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets (the “Collateral”). The Loan Agreement and Note contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt or create liens on its property. The Loan Agreement and the Note also provide for certain events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, the occurrence of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit Lender, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement and the Note, as applicable, and to exercise its remedies with respect to the Collateral. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement and Note, all amounts then outstanding (including principal and interest) shall bear interest at the rate of 18% per annum, compounded annually until the Event of Default is cured. On December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, principal amount due under this Note amounted to $500,000 and $0, respectively.
On July 22, 2021, in connection with the acquisition of Mobile Tint, we assumed vehicle and equipment loans in the amount of $95,013. These loans bear interest at rates ranging from 6.79% to 8.24% and are payable monthly through April 2025. On December 31, 2021, notes payable related to these vehicles and equipment amounted to $78,925.
On August 25, 2021, we entered into a subscription agreement with an accredited investor whereby the investor agreed to purchase 3,000 shares of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock for $300,000, or $100.00 per share, the stated value, which was used for working capital purposes. The conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock at the time of issuance was determined to be beneficial on the commitment date. Because the Series C Preferred Stock was perpetual with no stated maturity date, and the conversions could occur any time from the date of issuance, the Company immediately recorded a non-cash deemed dividend of $1,509,523 related to the beneficial conversion feature arising from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock. This non-cash deemed dividend increased the Company’s net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share.
On October 15, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Mercer Street Global Opportunity Fund, LLC (the “Investor”), pursuant to which the Company received $750,000 (less $10,000 of Investor’s fees) in exchange for the issuance of a 10% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible Promissory Note (the “Initial Note”) in the principal amount of $825,000, and a five-year warrant (the “Initial Warrant”) to purchase, in the aggregate, shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.05 per share in an amount equal to 50% of the conversion shares to be issued. The transactions contemplated under the SPA closed on October 18, 2021. Pursuant to the SPA, the Investor has agreed to purchase an additional $825,000 10% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible Promissory Note (the “Second Note,” and together with the Initial Note, the “Notes”), and a five-year warrant (the “Second Warrant,” and together with the Initial Warrant, the “Warrants”) to purchase, in the aggregate, shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.05 per share from the Company in an amount equal to 50% of the conversion shares to be issued upon the same terms as the Initial Note and Initial Warrant (subject to there being no event of default under the Initial Note or other customary closing conditions), within three trading days of a registration statement registering the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable under the Notes (the “Conversion Shares”) and upon exercise of the Warrants (the “Warrant Shares”) being declared effective by the SEC. The Notes mature 12 months after issuance, bear interest at a rate of 4% per annum, and are initially convertible into the Company’s common stock at a fixed conversion price of $0.025 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock combinations, dilutive issuances, and similar events, as described in the Notes.
The Notes may be prepaid at any time for the first 90 days at face value plus accrued interest. From day 91 through day 180, the Notes may be prepaid in an amount equal to 110% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. From day 181 through the day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Notes may be prepaid in an amount equal to 120% of the principal amount plus accrued interest.
The Notes and Warrants contain conversion limitations providing that a holder thereof may not convert the Notes or exercise the Warrants to the extent (but only to the extent) that, if after giving effect to such conversion, the holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock immediately after giving effect to such conversion or exercise. A holder may increase or decrease its beneficial ownership limitation upon notice to the Company provided that in no event such limitation exceeds 9.99%, and that any increase shall not be effective until the 61st day after such notice.
In connection with the SPA, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated October 15, 2021 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), with the Investor pursuant to which it is obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC within 45 days after the date of the agreement to register the resale by the Investor of the conversion shares and warrant shares, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within 60 days after the registration statement is filed.
Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes, the Investor has the right to be prepaid at 125% of the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest, and interest accrues at 18% per annum.
The Company has also granted the Investor a 12-month (or until the Notes are no longer outstanding) right to participate in specified future financings, up to a level of 30%.
On March 14, 2022, the Company entered into an Original Issue Discount Promissory Note and Security Agreement (the “March 2022 Note”) in the principal amount of $197,500 with Mercer Street Global Opportunity Fund, LLC (the “Investor”). The March 2022 Note was funded on March 14, 2022 and the Company received net proceeds of $175,000 which is net of an Original Issue Discount of $22,500, which included $5,000 of the Investor’s legal fees. The March 2022 Note matures 12 months after issuance and bears interest at a rate of 3% per annum. At any time, the Company may prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of the March 2022 Note and any accrued and unpaid interest without penalty. The March 2022 Note also creates a lien on and grants a priority security interest in all of the Company’s assets.
Additional cash liquidity is generated from product sales. However, to date, we are not profitable, and we cannot provide any assurances that we will be profitable. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our current operating plans.

Funding Requirements
We expect the primary use of capital to continue to be salaries, legal, accounting and regulatory expenses and general overhead costs including sales and marketing. Additional uses of capital will include additional headcount, tools and equipment, capacity expansion and operational control software. We believe current cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements. Additional capital will be required to further research new product verticals and enhancements to current product offerings based on customer requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, we determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to maintain operations as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common and preferred shares, from the issuance of notes payable, and from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially because of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements are difficult to forecast. Please see the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risks associated with our capital requirements.
Until such time as we generate substantial product revenue to offset operational expenses, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings and debt financings. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Contractual Obligations
We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contracted research and testing organization, product distribution and material vendors which are payable or cancelable at any time with 30-day prior written approval.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the period presented as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
