The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in this Annual Report, including statements regarding the anticipated development and expansion of our business, our intent, belief, or current expectations, primarily with respect to our future operating performance and the products and services we expect to offer and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are “forward-looking” statements. Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also forward-looking statements which involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of our operations is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We sell, lease, and rent heavy equipment to companies within four industries: construction (light and infrastructure), shipping logistics, mining, forestry, and commercial farming. With customers in the United States, Canada,
Latin America, Asia, and Africa, we have over 30 years of experience in heavy equipment sales and service and maintain inventories of top-of-the-line equipment from manufacturers such as Taylor Machine Works Inc., ASV, and Terex Heavy Equipment.
We were originally incorporated as Hamre Equipment Company, Inc. in California on November 17, 1989. We merged into AmeraMex International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on November 2, 2006.
Selected Financial Data
Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2020
We had revenues of $24,721,838 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to revenue of $12,279,120 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 101% increase. This increase is attributed to the conversion of six machines from long-term rent to sales, a multi-machine purchase by one of our long-term customers, the momentum our industry has experience since the re-opening of the State of California after the pandemic and the reduced interest rates our customers have secured while obtaining financing.
We had costs of revenue of $19,694,075 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to costs of $10,509,656 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our costs increased by $9,184,419, or 87%. This increase is as a result of purchasing significantly more machines to meet the demand.
We experienced an increase in operating expenses of $1,863,797 in 2021 as compared to $1,828,073 in 2020. This is an increase of approximately 2% in operating expenses. However, if we remove the legal settlement that caused the higher operating costs in 2020, the increase year over year is 33%. The majority of this increase is made up from selling expenses which were almost double when comparing the two years. This is consistent with the increase in Total Sales numbers.
We had net profit of $1,631,747 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net loss of $582,690 for the year ended December 31, 2010. We had an increase of $2,214,437 in our net income due to the record-breaking sales made in 2021 fiscal year.
Sales of Equipment and Other Revenues in 2021 were $22,253,695 and made up 90% of our Total Revenues and in 2020 made up $9,665,607, or 79%, of Total Revenues. The remaining portion of Total Revenues, Rentals and Leases, was $2,468,143, or 10%, in 2021 and in 2020, Rentals and Leases made up 21% of Total Revenues and totaled $2,631,172.
Gross profit on Sales of Equipment and Other Revenues in 2021 increased from $98,905 in 2020 to $3,375,450 in 2021. During the first six months of 2020, we had significantly lower labor and hauling revenue due to the Pandemic. While business improved during the last six months of 2020, we couldn’t make up the deficit of the first six months. However, we had record-breaking sales all throughout 2021 as Pandemic-related restrictions eased and lifted, and the country better adapted to the effects of COVID-19.
From 2020 to 2021, Sales of Equipment and Other Revenues increased $12,588,088, or 130% while during the same period Rentals and Leases decreased $145,370, or 6%. In 2021, while we did obtain new rental contracts throughout the year, six rental contracts were converted to sales which accounts for the decrease year over year in Rental Revenue. At the same time, Equipment Sales were at record highs compared to the record lows of 2020 due to the Global Pandemic.
We experienced an increase in operating expenses from $1,863,797 in 2021 as compared to $1,828,073 in 2020. This increase of approximately 2% in operating expenses is a result of the combined record sales for 2021 and of the Global Pandemic and a one-time legal settlement liability of 2020.
From 2020 to 2021, our Interest Expense decreased from $1,047,330 to $943,442. This decrease is due in part to the reduction in debt incurred and reduced interest rates tied to financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

We expect to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations, and to continue to obtain financing for equipment purchases in the normal course of business.
Management may sell and lease equipment and obtain additional debt financing to acquire equipment and provide cash flow for operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
All companies are required to include a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of their financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our inventory consists of used equipment held for sale and includes parts and attachments. Our inventory is valued at the lower of the inventory’s cost (specific identification or first in, first out basis) or the current market price of the inventory, less costs to sell. Our expenditures for transporting equipment to our facility and refurbishment costs, including parts and labor, are added to the value of the inventory and these costs are capitalized. Our management compares the cost of inventory with its market value and allowances are made to write down inventory to market value if market value is lower.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs for property and equipment and rental equipment are expensed as incurred. Any additional renewals and improvements to property and equipment and rental equipment, and which extend its useful life, are capitalized. When these assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related costs for the assets and the accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts. Any gain or loss is included in our operations. We depreciate these assets using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows:
For the impairment or disposal of our long-lived assets (assets expected to be kept for at least one year) used in operations, when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the type of asset are less than the asset’s carrying amounts, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Any loss on long-lived assets which are disposed are determined in a similar manner, however, the fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. In 2021 and 2020, we do not believe we had any impairment of our long-lived assets.
Revenue Recognition
Our primary source of generating revenue is through the sale and rental of heavy equipment. In accordance with accounting rules, we recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of the promised equipment and reflect what we are paid in exchange for the equipment. To determine our revenue recognition depending upon whether the equipment is sold or leased, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) calculate the transfer price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the customer satisfies a performance obligation. In the event any revenue does not meet these recognition criteria, such revenue will be deferred.
Equipment Sales - We recognize revenue from the sale of equipment upon delivery of the equipment to the customer and passing the risk of loss to the customer, and when we have no other significant obligations with regard to the equipment and collectability of the revenue from the customer is reasonably assured.
Equipment Rentals - Our rental revenues are made up of short-term agreements with monthly or annual terms. We recognize rental revenues in the month rental payments are due based upon the accrual method of accounting. Our equipment lease agreements contain varying terms, but typically range from one to five years for commercial entities. In addition to commercial entities, we also have lease agreements with various governments that have terms of 12 to 24 months and contain options to renew annually through five years. When lease terms are completed, and depending on the specific lease agreement, our customers may have the option to return the equipment, to renew the lease term, purchase the equipment at fair market value, or continue to rent the equipment on a month-to-month basis. Our agreements do not contain provisions for contingent rentals, which would allow rentals to cease or continue based upon certain defined events. Rental revenues for equipment leases are recognized upon receipt. Our initial direct costs for rental equipment are capitalized and amortized over the expected term of the applicable lease. To date, initial direct costs for operating leases have not been significant.
