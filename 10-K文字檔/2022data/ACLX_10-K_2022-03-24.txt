Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the sections titled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. For convenience of presentation, some of the numbers have been rounded in the text below. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases. We believe cell therapies are one of the forward pillars of medicine and our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective and more broadly accessible. Though cell therapies have shown benefits to date, cell therapies have historically been constrained to existing biologic structures, which has limited their impact and opportunity. Our novel synthetic binding scaffold, the D-Domain, is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts). Existing cell therapy solutions, most of which
use a biologic-based, single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domain, tend to be beneficial to a limited segment of patients, often result in high toxicity, and have narrow applicability in treatable indications. We believe we can overcome these limitations by engineering a new class of D-Domain powered autologous and allogeneic CAR-Ts, including classical single infusion CAR-Ts called ddCARs and dosable and controllable universal CAR-Ts called ARC-SparX, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, or indications outside of oncology such as autoimmune diseases. We recently announced positive preliminary results for the first 24 patients dosed in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA, our lead ddCAR product candidate, for treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) Multiple Myeloma (MM), that demonstrate that D-Domains can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefits. We plan to initiate additional trials with CART-ddBCMA including iMMagine, our Phase 2 pivotal trial in r/r MM, in late 2022, as well as expansion studies to earlier lines of therapy. We are also advancing our novel ARC-SparX programs, ACLX-001 in r/r MM and ACLX-002 and ACLX-003 in r/r acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We plan to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials for ACLX-001 and ACLX-002 in 2022 and a Phase 1 clinical trial for ACLX-003 in 2024. We are also exploring indications in solid tumors, as well as integrating AI-powered discovery and computational tools to expand the applicability of our platforms.
Since our formation, we have devoted substantially all our resources to discovering and developing our product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses to date. Our net losses were $65.0 million and $32.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $130.1 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of and expenditures on our planned research and development activities. We expect our operating expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•Expand the clinical program for CART-ddBCMA to include expanded enrollment of the Phase 1 clinical trial, the initiation of the planned Phase 2 pivotal trial and subsequent clinical trials focused on earlier lines of therapy;
•Grow our supply and contract manufacturing infrastructure to support the continued development of CART-ddBCMA;
•Initiate clinical trials to evaluate our lead ARC-SparX product candidates, ACLX-001, ACLX-002, and ACLX-003;
•Expand our pipeline of product candidates, including through our own product discovery and development efforts or through acquisition or in-licensing;
•Continue to develop our proprietary platforms to extend their use;
•Attract, hire, and retain additional clinical, scientific, manufacturing, management and administrative personnel;
•Add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, as well as to support our transition to a public reporting company;
•Require increased manufacturing capabilities with third parties for our preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•Determine and execute our long-term manufacturing strategy;
•Pursue regulatory approval of product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•Establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•Obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio, and
•Incur costs associated with being a public company, including legal, accounting and auditing, investor relations, and compliance.
As a result, we will continue to require substantial additional funding to develop our product candidates and our platforms and to support our continuing operations. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval, and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. We may also be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our development efforts. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
To date, we have not had any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales and we have accumulated significant losses. Since our formation in December 2014 through December 31, 2021, we funded our operations primarily with an aggregate of $234.8 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale and issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $104.6 million. Based on our expected operating cash requirements and capital expenditures, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with the gross cash proceeds of $142.3 million from our IPO and $10.0 million from a subsequent private placement are adequate to fund operations into the second half of 2023.
Initial Public Offering
On February 8, 2022, we completed our IPO, in which we sold an aggregate of 9,487,500 shares of our common stock, which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase 1,237,500 additional shares of its common stock, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $128.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present substantial public health and economic challenges around the world, and to date has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, mandated business closures and other public health safety measures.
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it has and will continue to impact our operations and the operations of our suppliers, vendors, and business partners, and may take further precautionary and preemptive actions as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities. In addition, we have taken steps to minimize the current environment’s impact on our business and strategy, including devising contingency plans and securing additional resources from third party service providers. For the safety of our employees and families, we have introduced enhanced safety measures in our facilities.
Beyond the impact on our pipeline, the extent to which COVID-19 ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the emergence of new variants, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, including vaccination campaigns, among others. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, however, were to experience any additional shutdowns or other prolonged business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially or negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although to date, our business has not been materially impacted by COVID-19, it is possible that our clinical development timelines could be negatively affected by COVID-19, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of the potential adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future. In the future, we may generate revenue from payments received under collaboration agreements, which could include payments of upfront fees, license fees,
milestone-based payments, and reimbursements for research and development efforts. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred in connection with our CART-ddBCMA program, the development of our ARC-SparX product candidates and the ongoing discovery and development efforts for additional product candidates.
External expenses include:
•Payments to third parties in connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, including CROs and consultants;
•The cost of manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including payments to CMOs and consultants;
•Payments to third parties in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates, including outsourced professional scientific development services, consulting research fees and for sponsored research arrangements with third parties;
•Laboratory supplies used in the preclinical development of our product candidates; and
•Allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for IT, rent and maintenance of facilities.
Internal expenses include employee-related costs, including salaries, related benefits, and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions.
We expense research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We track external costs on a program-by-program basis beginning with lead candidate selection. External costs that are not allocated to a program are classified as preclinical and discovery costs. We do not track internal costs by program because these costs are deployed across multiple programs, and as such, are not separately classified.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we advance CART-ddBCMA into a Phase 2 pivotal trial; initiate clinical trials for our ARC-SparX product candidates, including ACLX-001 and ACLX-002; continue to discover and develop additional product candidates to expand our pipeline; maintain, expand, protect, and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, and we do not believe it is possible at this time to accurately project the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. To the extent our product candidates continue to advance into clinical trials, as well as advance into larger and later-stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from our product candidates to offset these expenses. Because of the early stage of development of our product candidates, our ability to eventually generate significant revenues from product sales will depend on a number of factors, including:
•Identification of additional target antigens for desired indications;
•Identification and engineering of D-Domain-based binding regions that bind to the desired target antigens;
•Successful completion of preclinical studies;
•Submission of INDs or other regulatory applications for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials and authorizations from regulators to initiate clinical studies;
•Successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;
•Achieving favorable results from clinical trials;
•Receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•Establishing and maintaining sufficient manufacturing capabilities, whether internally or with third parties, or arrangements for clinical supplies;
•Sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•Effectively competing with other therapies;
•Developing and implementing successful marketing and reimbursement strategies;
•Obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and
•Maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of any product following approval, if any.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these factors could significantly impact the costs, timing, and viability associated with the development of our product candidates and our ability to generate significant revenues from product sales.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits, and share-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we increase our headcount to support the growth of the company. We further expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially as we will incur substantially higher expenses relating to accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance, and investor and public relations as a result of being a public company.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities. Our interest income has not been significant to date due to low interest earned on invested balances.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
The break-down of our external and internal research and development costs is as follows (in thousands):
Research and development expenses were $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $21.8 million. This increase in research and development expenses was driven by $12.2 million of higher external costs associated with our CART-ddBCMA clinical trial and $2.8 million of higher external costs related to preclinical development of our other product candidates. Additionally, our internal costs reflect an increase of $6.8 million in personnel costs principally related to the addition of research and development and clinical employees.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $11.1 million. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $8.3 million in personnel related costs due to an increase in headcount, together with increases in consulting fees of $1.1 million attributable to new branding, marketing, and strategy initiatives, $0.7 million in professional fees related to legal, consultants, and accounting and audit services, $0.6 million in facilities costs, and $0.4 million in other expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $65.0 million and $32.1 million, respectively, and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $130.1 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $104.6 million.
In the first quarter of 2022, we received approximately $128.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in net cash proceeds from our IPO and a private placement subsequent to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, we have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes totaling $234.8 million in gross cash proceeds. Based on our expected operating cash requirements and capital expenditures, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with the net cash proceeds from our IPO and the private placement subsequent to the IPO are adequate to fund operations into the second half of 2023.
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize any of, our product candidates or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and
begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Moreover, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We may seek to raise capital through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, for which the requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•The scope, progress, timing, results, and costs of developing and manufacturing our product candidates, and their components, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and other testing of our product candidates;
•Our ability to continue our business operations and product candidate research and development, and to adapt to any changes in the regulatory approval process, manufacturing supply, or clinical trial requirements and timing due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise, including our ability to comply with new regulatory guidance or requirements on conducting clinical trials during and after the COVID-19 pandemic;
•The costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of any of our product candidates;
•The costs and timing of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights;
•Our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty or other payments due under any such agreement;
•The costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•The extent to which our product candidates, if approved, can be offered by prescribers in various clinical settings, including academic hospitals and community practices, the acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, and the revenue received from commercial sale of any products for which we receive marketing approval;
•The effect of competing technologies and market developments; and
•The extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies, and any other licensing or collaboration arrangements for any of our product candidates.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us additional covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.
Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials or we may also be required to sell or license to others rights to our product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. If we are required to enter into collaborations and other arrangements to supplement our funds, we may have to give up certain rights that limit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or we may have to accept other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders, which could materially affect our business and financial condition.
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $54.2 million was primarily attributable to our net loss of $65.0 million, partially offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.8 million and non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities, and share-based compensation in total of $8.0 million.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $28.7 million was primarily attributable to our net loss of $32.1 million, partially offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.7 million and non-cash charges for depreciation of property and equipment and share-based compensation in total of $1.7 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $80.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to $74.2 million in purchases of marketable securities and $5.8 million of purchases of lab equipment used in the development of our cell therapies.
Net cash used in investing activities of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to purchases of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $118.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $119.1 million from the sale of shares of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of transaction costs and proceeds of $0.4 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.6 million in payments of deferred offering costs associated with our IPO and $0.4 million in payments under capital leases.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $41.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $42.8 million from the sale of shares of our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of transaction costs, partially offset by $1.2 million in payments of offering costs associated with our IPO.
Contractual Obligations and Contingencies
Our total future minimum lease payments for our operating and capital leases for each of the next five years and in total are included in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies and in Note 8, Capital Lease Obligations to our consolidated financial statements, respectively. The total future undiscounted minimum lease payments were $7.3 million and $0.3 million related to our operating and capital leases, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.
We lease certain office and laboratory space in Gaithersburg, Maryland under a non-cancelable operating lease that has a term that expires in 2030 unless renewed. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
In addition, we have entered into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation.
We have entered into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which include manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payments for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amount of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreement. In addition, certain agreements with our CMOs and third-party vendors contain development and commercial milestone payments and low single-digit royalties on worldwide net sales for certain products we sell that incorporate certain goods provided by our manufacturers and suppliers. Certain of these agreements contain development milestones of up to $18.7 million in the aggregate and commercial milestones of up to $52.0 million in the aggregate, along with royalty buyout provisions.
In September 2021, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. (Lonza) in connection with the development and manufacture of autologous drug product CART-ddBCMA (the Lonza Agreement), whereby Lonza agreed to perform certain process and analytical development activities and to collaborate with the Company to develop a statement of work setting forth certain technology transfer and cGMP manufacturing activities relating to CART-ddBCMA. In February 2022, and pursuant to the Lonza Agreement, we entered into a statement of work (Lonza SOW) for the technology transfer and cGMP manufacturing of CART-ddBCMA and potentially other pipeline products. The term of the Lonza SOW commences from February 1, 2022 and expires December 31, 2024, unless earlier terminated by either party or unless extended due to certain delays or suspensions or by mutual agreement. Under the Lonza SOW, we are obligated to pay to Lonza certain payments aggregating a total of approximately $24.5 million in 2022, including creditable up-front payments, creditable milestone fees that are subject to certain deductions and fixed monthly payments and which are payable over the term of the Lonza SOW. In the event of suspensions or delays caused by non-availability of materials, we will be obligated to pay a majority of certain non-cancellable costs incurred during such suspension or delay. In the event of suspensions or delays caused by certain reasons outside of the reasonable control of the Company, we will be obligated to continue paying a majority percentage of the fixed monthly payments during such suspension or delay. The Lonza SOW is non-cancellable for the first six (6) months of the term and carries minimum non-cancellable costs amounting to a potential aggregate of up to approximately $35 million in the event of termination.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a periodic basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Research and development expenses, including clinical trial accruals and related expenses
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits of research and development personnel, costs related to research activities, preclinical studies, and overhead and facility-related costs. We account for advanced payments, including non-refundable amounts, for goods or services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the related goods have been received or when the service has been performed, or such a time when we do not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be performed, rather than when the payment is made.
Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on estimates and representations from service providers regarding work performed, including actual level of patient enrollment, completion of patient studies, and progress of the clinical trials. Other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain. Similarly, we accrue expenses related to the work performed by CMOs based on the progress of the work performed. If the amounts that we are obligated to pay under clinical trial agreements and manufacturing agreements are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), the accruals are adjusted accordingly. Revisions to contractual payment obligations are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.
Share-based compensation
We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards or restricted stock units, to be recognized as expense based on their grant date fair values. Our policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur.
We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing (Black-Scholes) model for stock option grants to both employees and non-employees. We will reconsider the use of the Black-Scholes model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that prevent their value from being reasonably estimated using this model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions. Our methodology for developing the assumptions used in the valuation model are as follows:
Fair Value of Common Stock-See the subsection titled “Determination of the fair value of our common stock and fair value of total equity” below.
Expected Dividend Yield-The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical and expected dividend payouts. The Company has historically paid no dividends and does not anticipate dividends to be paid in the future.
Expected Equity Volatility-Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock (prior to the Company’s IPO) and the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us (e.g., public entities of similar size, complexity, stage of development and industry focus). The historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with expected term assumption.
Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options.
Expected Term-We use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.
The Company’s share-based compensation related to stock options subject to service conditions are recognized as expense ratably over the required service period based on their grant date fair values.
The fair value of restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, and restricted stock units (collectively, awards) without a market condition (e.g., certain market capitalization thresholds) is determined based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. Vesting of awards is accelerated for certain employees in the event of a change in control or in the event that we remove the employee with or without cause from their position.
We estimate the fair value of awards subject to both a market condition and a performance condition on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For awards with vesting subject to the fulfillment of both market and performance conditions, share-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method beginning when the achievement of the performance condition becomes probable over the applicable service period. The amount of share-based compensation expense is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the performance condition being satisfied and our estimate, which may vary over time, of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. If the performance condition is not met, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.
We granted restricted stock units (RSU Award) to an executive officer subject to service, performance, and market conditions and used the Monte Carlo simulation model approach to estimate the fair value of the RSU Award on the date of grant. We utilized Monte Carlo simulation models to estimate the fair value of the RSUs on the date of grant. In applying the Monte Carlo methodology, the total equity value on various measurement dates were simulated and allocated to the various classes of equity in the Company’s capital structure according to the characteristics of that capital structure, such as the number of shares of each class of equity, seniority levels, liquidation preferences and conversion values for redeemable convertible preferred stock, and participation thresholds for common stock and each series of redeemable convertible preferred stock. The fair value of the RSU Award is the average of the discounted proceeds to the common stock across all simulated paths.
Application of the Monte Carlo simulation model required various subjective assumptions that represent management’s best estimates of the fair value of common stock, expected equity volatility, risk-free interest rate, discount period, expected dividend yield, and time to achievement of a performance condition:
Fair Value of Common Stock and Fair Value of Total Equity-See the subsection titled “Determination of the fair value of our common stock and fair value of total equity” below.
Expected Equity Volatility-Due to the lack of a public market for the Company’s common stock (prior to the Company’s IPO) and the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company has based its computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to the Company (e.g., public entities of similar size, complexity, stage of development, and industry focus). The historical volatility is calculated based on a period commensurate with the expected date of achievement of a performance condition.
Risk-Free Interest Rate and Discount Period-The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected time to achieve of a performance condition. The discount period is the period between the valuation date and the assumed change in control event date, with the assumption that all equity shares in the capital structure are paid out in cash.
Expected Dividend Yield-The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical and expected dividend payouts. The Company has historically paid no dividends and does not anticipate dividends to be paid in the future.
Expected Time to Achievement of a Performance Condition-The time to the achievement of a performance condition is based on the Company’s best estimate of the period of time to achievement of a performance condition that attains the established market capitalization thresholds.
Determination of the fair value of our common stock and fair value of total equity
Given the lack of an active public market for our common stock and other equity instruments prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock and total equity was determined by the board of directors with input from management and consideration of third-party valuation reports. In the absence of a public trading market, and as a clinical-stage company with no significant revenues, we believe that it is appropriate to consider a range of factors to determine the fair market value of the common stock at each grant date and resulting total equity value. In determining the fair value of our common stock and total equity value, we use methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. In addition, we considered various objective and subjective factors, along with input from the independent third-party valuation firm. The factors included (1) our achievement of clinical and operational milestones; (2) the significant risks associated with our stage of development; (3) capital market conditions for life science companies, particularly similarly situated, privately held, early-stage life science companies; (4) our available cash, financial condition, and results of operations; (5) the most recent sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock; and (6) the preferential rights of the outstanding preferred stock.
The Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, our board of directors considered the following methods:
•Probability-weighted expected return method. The PWERM is a scenario-based analysis that estimates the fair value of common stock based upon an analysis of future values for the business, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible forecasted outcomes as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at a non-marketable indication of value for the common stock.
•Option pricing method. Under the OPM, shares are valued by creating a series of call options, representing the present value of the expected future returns to the stockholders, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences and conversion terms of each equity class. The estimated fair values of the preferred and common stock are inferred by analyzing these options.
•Hybrid return method. The hybrid return method is a blended approach using aspects of both the PWERM and OPM, in which the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM.
Based on our early stage of development and other relevant factors, for our valuation performed on August 9, 2019, we determined that the hybrid method was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock and total equity value. Under the hybrid method, we analyzed various scenarios, including one scenario where we would remain an independent and private company, where the OPM was utilized, and an alternative scenario of a liquidation where a waterfall analysis was utilized, with the outcome of each scenario combined into a single probability-weighted valuation. The enterprise value under the remain independent and private company scenario was based on a backsolve to our latest round of financing. The enterprise value under the liquidation scenario was based on the recovery of value of our company as of the liquidation date.
For our valuations performed on May 31, 2020, December 23, 2020, April 9, 2021 and October 25, 2021, we used the PWERM whereby our total enterprise value was estimated under various exit scenarios and allocated to our different classes of equity. The PWERM included various scenarios in which we stay private, complete the sale of our company, complete an IPO or liquidate our company that considered our estimate of the timing of each scenario and were weighted based on our estimate of the probability of each event occurring. The enterprise value under the IPO scenarios was based on the guideline public company method market approach and considered comparable publicly traded companies. The enterprise value under the stay private scenarios was based on an OPM backsolve to our latest round of financing. As a concurrent equity financing did not occur on or around October 25, 2021, for the October 25, 2021 valuation the OPM backsolve was linked to the equity financing on April 9, 2021, adjusted for changes in comparable public company values between the two dates. The equity values under the scenarios in which we complete the sale of our company were based on the guideline transaction method market approach and considered comparable company transactions. The enterprise value under the liquidation scenarios was based on the asset approach and was based on the recovery of value of our company as of the liquidation dates.
The enterprise value determined under the PWERM and OPM was weighted according to our board of directors’ estimate of the probability of the occurrence of the particular discrete event as of the valuation date. The resulting equity value for the common stock was then divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date of the valuation to derive a per share value on a marketable basis. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock on a non-marketable basis, we then applied a discount for lack of marketability which we derived based on inputs including a company-specific volatility rate, a term equal to the expected time to a future liquidity event and a risk-free rate equal to the yield on U.S. treasury notes of similar duration.
Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the relationships between those assumptions, impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of common stock. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent our management’s best estimate, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.
Following the closing of February 2022 IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time that those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Unless we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act, we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years, or (iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO. An emerging growth company
may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company,
•We may present only two years of audited financial statements, plus unaudited condensed financial statements for any interim period, and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;
•We may avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•We may provide reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
•We may not require stockholder non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure and reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (1) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million or (2) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
