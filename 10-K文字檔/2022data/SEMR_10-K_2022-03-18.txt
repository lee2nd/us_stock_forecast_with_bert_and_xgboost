Company Overview
We are a leading online visibility management SaaS platform, enabling companies globally to identify and reach the right audience in the right context and through the right channels. Online visibility represents how effectively companies connect with consumers across a variety of digital channels, including search, social and digital media, digital public relations, and review websites. Our proprietary SaaS platform enables us to aggregate and enrich trillions of data points collected from hundreds of millions of unique domains, social media platforms, online ads, and web traffic. This allows our customers to understand trends, derive unique and actionable insights to improve their websites and social media pages, and distribute highly relevant content to their targeted customers across channels to drive high quality traffic.
On March 29, 2021, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 10,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $140.0 million. We received approximately $126.6 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. On April 20, 2021, the underwriters of our IPO partially exercised their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock. In connection with the closing of the partial exercise on April 23, 2021, the underwriters purchased 719,266 shares of our Class A common stock for net proceeds to us of $9.2 million. In connection with the closing of the IPO, all of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock and common stock automatically converted into 124,902,093 shares of Class B common stock.
On November 23, 2021, we closed our follow-on offering (the “Follow-On Offering”) in which we sold 4,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a price to the public of $20.50 per share. We received $77.9 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Selling stockholders sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in the Follow-On Offering.

We generate substantially all of our revenue from monthly and annual subscriptions to our online visibility management platform under a SaaS model. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date the product is made available to customers.
We have one reportable segment. See Note 14 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Our subscription model enables our paying customers to choose among tiered plans for a majority of our products to meet their specific needs. Our multi-price point pricing for our core product ranges between $100 and $400 per month or $1,000 to $4,000 per year for customers who purchased our core product prior to January 4, 2021 and do not let their subscriptions lapse, and between $119.95 and $449.95 per month or $1,199 to $4,499 per year for new customers as of January 4, 2021, with each price point providing an incremental level of access to our products and usage limits. Within our subscription tiers, customers have the ability to purchase increased usage limits by adding the ability to create additional projects, keywords to track, and seat licenses without moving to a higher price point plan. We have a demonstrated track record of customers consistently upgrading to higher price point plans to get access to incremental functionality and usage limits. Additionally, we offer add-ons that are not included in our subscription plans and are sold on a one-time or monthly basis depending on the add-on.
Since inception, we have managed our rapid growth with discipline and efficiency. We generated revenue of $188.0 million and $124.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing growth of 51%. Our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of over 50% between the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2021. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3.3 million and $7.0 million, respectively.
We believe that the growth of our business and our operating results will be dependent upon many factors, including our ability to acquire new and retain existing paying customers, increase revenue from existing paying customers, and sustain and adapt to product and technology innovation. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.
While we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last few years, we expect to continue to incur losses in the short term and may not be able to achieve profitability. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, increasing market awareness of our platform and products, and driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline. We believe that these efforts will result in an increase in our paying customer base, revenues, and improved operating margins in the long term. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from point solutions that address aspects of online visibility management. We must also effectively hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include:
Acquiring New Paying Customers
We expect increasing demand for third-party online visibility software to accelerate adoption of our platform. Our recurring subscription model provides significant visibility into our future results and we believe ARR is the best indicator of the scale of our platform, while mitigating fluctuations due to seasonality and contract term. We define ARR as the daily revenue of all paid subscription agreements that are actively generating revenue as of the last day of the reporting period multiplied by 365, except that we calculate the ARR from Prowly’s customers as the monthly recurring revenue as of the last month of the reporting period multiplied by 12. We include both monthly recurring paid subscriptions, which renew automatically unless cancelled, as well as the annual recurring paid subscriptions so long as we do not have any indication that a customer has cancelled or intends to cancel its subscription and we continue to generate revenue from them. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had more than 82,000 paying customers and 67,000 paying customers, respectively, accounting for $213.1 million and $144.2 million in ARR, respectively.
Retaining and Expanding Sales to Our Existing Customers
We serve a diverse customer base across a variety of sizes and industries that is focused on maximizing their online visibility. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand within our existing customer base as customers often initially purchase our entry-level subscription, which offers lower usage limits and limited user licenses, as well as fewer features. We have demonstrated the ability to expand contract values with our existing customers as they use our products and recognize the critical nature of our platform and often seek premium offerings through incremental usage, features, add-ons, and additional user licenses.
Our sales team is largely focused on driving account expansion by encouraging our customers to fully recognize the potential benefit from our comprehensive platform. As a result, we have become increasingly efficient at acquiring customers who increase their spend with us over time. The chart below illustrates the subscription revenue from each customer cohort based on the year in which they became customers during the year presented. As indicated in the chart, our customer cohorts typically experience their lowest dollar-based net revenue retention rate during their second full year after becoming a customer, after which the dollar-based net revenue retention rate typically improves and we are able to drive increased spending across the remaining customers within the cohort.
Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate enables us to evaluate our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 126% and 114%, respectively.
We calculate our dollar-based net revenue retention rate as of the end of a period by using (a) the revenue from our customers during the twelve month period ending one year prior to such period as the denominator and (b) the revenue from those same customers during the twelve months ending as of the end of such period as the numerator. This calculation excludes revenue from new customers and any non-recurring revenue.
We have successfully increased ARR per paying customer over time and believe this metric is an indicator of our ability to grow the long-term value of our platform. We expect ARR per paying customer to continue to increase as customers adopt our premium offerings and we continue to introduce new products and functionality. Our ARR per paying customer as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,584 and $2,123, respectively. We define ARR per paying customer during a given period as ARR from our paying customers at the end of the period divided by the number of paying customers as of the end of the same period. We define the number of paying customers as the number of unique business and individual customers at the end of a particular period. We define a business customer as all accounts that contain a common non-individual business email domain (e.g., all subscriptions with an email domain of @XYZ.com will be considered to be one customer), and an individual customer as an account that uses an individual non-business email domain.
Sustaining Product and Technology Innovation
We have a strong track record of developing new products that have high adoption rates among our paying customers. Our product development organization plays a critical role in continuing to enhance the effectiveness and differentiation of our technology in an evolving landscape and maximizing retention of our existing customers. We intend to continue investing in product development to improve our data assets, expand our products, and enhance our technological capabilities.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin, each a non-GAAP financial measure, are useful in evaluating the performance of our business.
Free cash flow and free cash flow margin
We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by total revenue. We monitor free cash flow and free cash flow margin as two measures of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow us to better understand the cash needs of our business. While we believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful in evaluating our business, free cash flow and free cash flow margin are each a non-GAAP financial measure that have limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow and free cash flow margin should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash used in operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of each of free cash flow and free cash flow margin as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as each measure does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow and free cash flow margin differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow and free cash flow margin as tool for comparison. A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities is provided below. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation of free cash flow margin to net cash used in operating activities (as a percentage of revenue), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on free cash flow, free cash flow margin or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
Components of our Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate nearly all of our revenue from subscriptions to our online visibility management platform under a SaaS model. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date on which we provide the customer access to our platform. Our customers do not have the right to take possession of our software. Our subscriptions are generally non-cancellable during the contractual subscription term, however our subscription contracts contain a right to a refund if requested within seven days of purchase.
We offer our paid products to customers via monthly or annual subscription plans, as well as one-time and ongoing add-ons. Our subscription-based model enables customers to select a plan based on their needs and license our platform on a per user per month basis.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we served approximately 82,000 and 67,000 paying customers, respectively, in various industries. Our revenue is not concentrated with any single customer or industry. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our revenue.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our platform, acquiring data, and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of personnel and related costs, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense related to the management of our data centers, our customer support team and our customer success team, and data acquisition costs. In addition to these expenses, we incur third-party service provider costs, such as data center and networking expenses, allocated overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense associated with our property and equipment, and amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs and other intangible assets. We allocate overhead costs, such as rent and facility costs, information technology costs, and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.
We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars due to expenditures related to the purchase of hardware, data, expansion, and support of our data center operations and customer support teams. We also expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will decrease over time as we are able to achieve economies of scale in our business, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of significant expenditures. To the extent that our customer base grows, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in expanding the delivery capability of our products and other services. The timing of these additional expenses could affect our cost of revenue, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in any particular quarterly or annual period.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development expenses also include depreciation expense and other expenses associated with product development. Other than internal-use software costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing new products, features, and enhancements to our platform. We believe that investing in the development of new products, features, and enhancements improves customer experience, makes our platform more attractive to new paying customers, and provides us with opportunities to expand sales to existing paying customers and convert free customers to paying customers. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing department, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation, online advertising expenses, and marketing and promotional expenses, as well as allocated overhead costs. We expense all costs as they are incurred, excluding sales commissions identified as incremental costs to obtain a contract, which are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average period of benefit, which we estimate to be two years. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the year ending December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. New sales personnel require training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity; as such, the costs we incur in connection with the hiring of new sales personnel in a given period are not typically offset by increased revenue in that period and may not result in new revenue if these sales personnel fail to become productive. We expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing as we add new services, which will increase these expenses in absolute dollars. Over the long term, we believe that sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will vary depending upon the mix of revenue from new and existing customers, as well as changes in the productivity of our sales and marketing programs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related expenses, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation, associated with our finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expenses also include professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, insurance, depreciation and amortization expense, as well as allocated overhead. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business. We expect to continue to incur expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, increases in insurance premiums, investor relations, and professional services. We expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.
Other (Expense) Income, Net
Other (expense) income, net primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest expense. With respect to foreign currency transaction gains and losses, the functional currency of our international operations is the U.S. dollar except for Prowly, which is Polish Zloty. Any differences
resulting from the re-measurement of assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded within other (expense) income, net. We expect our foreign currency exchange gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future as foreign currency exchange rates change. Interest expense is related to our outstanding Credit Agreement as well as interest associated with outstanding capital leases.
Other (expense) income, net also includes amounts for other miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations.
Income Tax Provision
We operate in several tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. We account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, this method requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To date, we have incurred cumulative net losses and maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Our tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily relates to income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions.

The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue
Our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:
Revenue increased in all regions. The majority of this increase was driven by an increase in the number of paying customers to 82,000 as of December 31, 2021 from 67,000 as of December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was also driven by an increase in the subscription price of our core product as well as growth in user licenses per customer, add-ons, and attach rates. We define attach rates as the ratio of the number of paying customers who purchase specific add-ons to the number of total paying customers.
Revenue based upon the locations of our paying customers during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin
The increase in cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the following changes:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased by $12.0 million. Hosting fees increased driven by the additional costs associated with our growth in subscription revenue and the additional costs associated with expanding our relationships with our current paying subscribers. Integration and data costs increased primarily as a result of increasing costs incurred related to new products and customer growth. Merchant fees increased commensurate with revenue growth. Other costs increased primarily as a result of an 18% increase in headcount as we continue to grow our customer support and customer success teams to support our customer growth.
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing
The increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the following:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, personnel costs increased by $8.5 million, primarily as a result of a 24% increase in headcount as we continue to expand our sales teams to grow our customer base. Personnel costs include the amortization of capitalized commission costs which increased year over year, partially due to the amortization of commissions paid in prior periods, as well as expense associated with the amortization of commissions paid and capitalized during 2021 which increased year over year due to the overall growth in sales.
Advertising expense increased as we accelerated our advertising spending in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021 as we continue to focus on acquiring new paying customers.
Research and Development
For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development costs increased by $6.8 million, primarily as a result of a 23% increase in headcount and higher personnel costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as we continue to expand our product development teams.
General and administrative
For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expense increased by $14.1 million, which was primarily driven by an increase in insurance costs as well as a 9% increase in headcount as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as we continue to expand our accounting and reporting, legal and compliance, and internal support teams. It was also driven by a 150% increase in stock-based compensation compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 applicable to these teams.
Other Expense, Net
The increase in other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $0.5 million related to our Credit Agreement as well as outstanding capital leases. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in the foreign exchange losses from foreign currency remeasurement adjustments associated with our international activities as well as a decrease in other income of $0.4 million related to other miscellaneous activities.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is primarily attributable to earnings in our foreign jurisdictions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity have been the net proceeds of our IPO and the Follow-On Offering, which totaled $213.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us, and the net proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities, as well as sales of premium subscriptions to our platform.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $269.7 million and accounts receivable of $2.2 million. We have generated annual losses from operations since inception. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future due to the investments in our business we intend to make as described above.
Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been to fund operations and invest in capital expenditures, and are held in cash deposits and money market funds.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our available financial resources from our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors.
In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Our Credit Facility
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement among us and Semrush US Sub, each as a borrower, the lenders party thereto from time to time and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, as amended from time to time, we have a senior secured credit facility that consists of a $45.0 million revolving credit facility and a letter of credit sub-facility with an aggregate limit equal to the lesser of $5.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. The availability of the credit facility is subject to the borrowing base based on an advance rate of 400% multiplied by annualized retention applied to monthly recurring revenue. The credit facility has a maturity of three years and will mature on January 12, 2024.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $45.0 million available under the revolving credit facility, with $5.0 million of such revolving commitments available under the letter of credit sub-facility.
All of our obligations under our credit facility will be guaranteed by our future domestic subsidiaries and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at our option at (i) LIBOR, subject to a 0.50% floor, plus a margin, or (ii) the alternate base rate, subject to a 3.25% floor (or 1.50% prior to positive consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) for the twelve months most recently ended), plus a margin. For LIBOR borrowings, the applicable rate margin is 2.75% (or 3.50% prior to positive consolidated adjusted EBITDA as of the twelve months most recently ended). For base rate borrowings, the applicable margin is 0.00% (or 2.50% prior to positive consolidated adjusted EBITDA as of the twelve months most recently ended). We are also required to pay a 0.25% per annum fee on undrawn amounts under our revolving credit facility, payable quarterly in arrears.
Operating Activities
Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscription services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for online advertising, personnel costs across the sales and marketing and product and development departments, and hosting costs.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $23.8 million, which resulted from a net loss of $3.3 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $13.0 million and a net cash inflow of $14.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $6.5 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs related to capitalized commissions, $3.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $2.7 million of stock based compensation expense. The changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $13.8 million increase in deferred revenue due to the addition of new customers and expansion of the
business, an $11.6 million increase in accrued expenses, and a $1.5 million increase in accounts payable. These inflows were partially offset by a $9.4 million increase in deferred contract costs, a $2.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.8 million increase in accounts receivable.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.9 million, which resulted from a net loss of $7.0 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $7.6 million and net cash inflow of $5.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $4.6 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs related to capitalized commissions, $1.1 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $6.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to the addition of new customers and expansion of the business, a $2.5 million increase in accrued expenses, a $1.8 million increase in accounts payable, and a $0.7 million decrease in accounts receivable. These inflows were partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in deferred contract costs.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $1.5 million was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in capitalized costs associated with internal use software and $0.5 million in purchases of convertible debt securities.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $215.3 million, which was primarily driven by $215.4 million in net proceeds from our public offerings and, to a lesser extent, from $1.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.7 million, which was primarily driven by $1.9 million in payments for deferred offering and credit facility costs. The payment of deferred offering costs relates to the IPO and the payment of the credit facility costs relates to the opening of a line of credit, as discussed above. These cash outflows were partially offset by $0.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, our contractual obligations consisted of: (i) operating lease commitments of $11.5 million, of which $4.1 million is due in 2022 and $7.4 million is due thereafter, and (ii) other purchase obligations of $10.3 million, a majority of which are due in 2022.
We entered into leases for certain data center equipment under non-cancelable capital leases during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The lease arrangements have terms of 36 months beginning on the date we accept the installation of the equipment subject to the lease. As of December 31, 2020, no equipment had been installed and the Company had not accepted the equipment under these leases, and as such the lease commencement date had not begun. During the year ended December 31, 2021, a portion of the equipment was installed and their related leases commenced. We are required to make total payments of $7.0 million over the term of the leases, and have a remaining obligation of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2021, which is excluded from other purchase obligations above.
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with any entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. As a result, we are not
exposed to related financing, liquidity, market, or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in those types of arrangements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to sections titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our audited consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognition Policy
We generate revenue primarily from subscriptions to our online visibility management platform, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our SaaS services and related customer support. We offer subscriptions to our platform primarily on a monthly or annual basis and we sell our products and services primarily through a self-service model and also directly through our sales force. Our subscription arrangements provide customers the right to access our hosted software applications and customers do not have the right to take possession of our software during the hosting arrangement.
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the term of the contract, beginning on the date the customer is provided access to our service. These subscriptions are generally stand-ready obligations as the customer has access to the service throughout the term of the subscription, and our performance obligations are satisfied with the customer over time. We consider the SaaS subscription and related support services to have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. As such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. We primarily invoice and collect payments from our customers for in advance on a monthly or annual basis.
Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as
current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.
Costs to Obtain a Contract
We capitalize incremental direct costs of obtaining revenue contracts, which primarily consist of sales commissions paid for new subscription contracts. We amortize these commissions over a period of approximately 24 months on a systematic basis, consistent with the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The 24-month period represents the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship and has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of our technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period based on historical experience and future expectations. Sales commissions for renewals and upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer. Deferred contract costs that will be recorded as expense during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded as current deferred contract costs, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred contract costs, net of current portion. Amortization of deferred contract costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and members of our board of directors for their services as directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have only issued stock options with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the estimated fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.
We determined the assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. These assumptions and estimates are as follows:
Fair value-Prior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of our common stock. Our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as awards were approved, including utilizing third-party valuations to assist with the determination of the estimated fair-market value and common stock price. Following the closing of the IPO, our Class A common stock is publicly traded, and therefore we currently base the value of our Class A common stock on its market price.
Expected dividend yield-The annual rate of dividends is expressed as a dividend yield which is a constant percentage of the stock price. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend on common stock in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, use an expected dividend yield of zero.
Expected term-The expected life of an option represents the period of time that an option is expected to be outstanding. The expected term of an award is determined using the simplified method for plain vanilla options, consistent with applicable accounting guidance.
Risk-free rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards.
Expected volatility-As we do not have a trading history of our common stock, there is no historical basis of the stock volatility. Accordingly, the expected volatility is based primarily on the historical volatilities of similar entities’ common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards.
The weighted-average fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $8.45 and $2.01 per share, respectively. The weighted-average assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of options granted are presented in the following table:
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that have not made this election.
