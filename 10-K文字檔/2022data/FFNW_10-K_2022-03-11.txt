Overview
First Financial Northwest Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest and, as such, comprises substantially all of the activity for First Financial Northwest. First Financial Northwest Bank was a community-based savings bank until February 4, 2016, when the Bank converted to a Washington state chartered commercial bank reflecting the commercial banking services it now provides to its customers. The Bank primarily serves King, Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap counties, Washington through its full-service banking office and headquarters in Renton, Washington, as well as seven retail branches in King County, Washington, five retail branches in Snohomish County, Washington, and two retail branches in Pierce County, Washington at December 31, 2021. The Bank purchased four of these branches in 2017 and acquired $74.7 million in deposits (the “Branch Acquisition”). The Branch Acquisition expanded our retail footprint and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities.
The Bank’s business consists predominantly of attracting deposits from the general public, combined with borrowing from the FHLB of Des Moines and raising funds in the wholesale market, then utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business, and consumer loans. The Bank’s strategic initiatives seek to diversify our loan portfolio and broaden growth opportunities with our current risk tolerance levels and asset/liability objectives. Our business strategy emphasizes commercial real estate, construction, one-to-four family residential, and multifamily lending. During 2021, loan originations, refinances and purchases moderately outpaced repayments of loans, resulting in a small increase of $2.9 million to net loans receivable with ending balances of $1.10 billion at December 31, 2021, and 2020. Originations of construction/land loans were $72.8 million in 2021 as compared to $62.4 million in 2020, resulting in this portfolio increasing to $93.5 million at December 31, 2021, as compared to $92.2 million at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that construction/land lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction/land lending by concentrating our efforts on residential loans to builders known to us, including multifamily loans to developers with proven success in this type of construction. These loans typically mature in 12 to 24 months and funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, therefore the impact to net loans receivable is generally minimal in the short term.
We have also geographically expanded our loan portfolio through loan purchases or loan participations of commercial and multifamily real estate loans, as well as consumer classic car loans, that are outside of our primary market area. Through our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with direct loan originations, loan participations, or loan purchases, our portfolio includes $144.1 million of loans to borrowers or secured by properties located in 43 other states, plus Washington, D.C., with the largest concentrations at December 31, 2021, in California, Oregon, Texas, Florida, and Alabama of $38.7 million, $12.1 million, $10.8 million, $9.2 million and $8.1 million, respectively.
The Bank has also created an SBA department, and has affiliated with an SBA partner to process our SBA loans while the Bank retains the credit decisions. This enables us to be active in lending to small businesses until our volumes are high enough to support the investment in necessary infrastructure. When volumes support our becoming an SBA preferred lender, we will apply for that status which would provide the Bank with delegated loan approval as well as closing and most servicing and liquidation authority, enabling the Bank to make loan decisions more rapidly. In addition, the Bank plans to increase originations of the business loan portfolio, which may include business lines of credit, business term loans or equipment financing. In conjunction with the growth of business loans, the Bank seeks to service these customers with their business deposits as well.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $12.2 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to $8.6 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary contributor to this increase was a $4.5 million increase in net interest income as our decrease in interest expense exceeded the decrease in interest income. In addition, the provision for loan losses in 2021 decreased $1.6 million to $300,000 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of a $2.1 million increase in net loans receivable, changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and decreased historical loss factors and qualitative factors for certain loan categories as the expected economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to the credit quality of our loan portfolio has diminished this year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a provision of $1.9 million, primarily the result of the downgrade in the loan risk ratings of $61.0 million of loans, primarily loans receiving an additional COVID-19 related payment deferral under the CARES Act combined with increases in probable loan losses for all loan categories in response to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher potential impact allocated to commercial real estate and construction/land portfolios. Partially offsetting these improvements, noninterest income decreased $580,000 and noninterest expenses increased $854,000.
Our primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments. Interest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently and, thus, impacts our net interest income. First Financial Northwest Bank is currently slightly asset-sensitive, meaning our interest-earning assets reprice at a faster rate than our interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank had a modest improvement in the net interest margin over the last year. The cost of funds has declined substantially due to the higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, the repricing of retail certificates of deposit at much lower market rates, and the payoff of all brokered certificates of deposit in 2020. Loan yields in 2021 were impacted favorably as a result of recognition of unamortized deferred fee income on PPP loans forgiven and repaid by the SBA. If market interest rates remain near historic lows, the Company expects continued downward pressure on loan yields. Further, because the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures put in place to address its economic consequences are unknown, until the pandemic subsides, the Company’s net interest income and net interest margin may be adversely affected in the near term, if not longer.
An offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, or the recapture of the provision for loan losses, that is required to establish the ALLL at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our ALLL may increase, resulting in a decrease to net interest income after the provision. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in property values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any required increase to ALLL due to loan growth or an increase in probable loan losses.
Noninterest income is generated from various loan or deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”), and revenue earned on our wealth management services. This income is increased or partially offset by any net gain or loss on sales of investment securities. Our noninterest income decreased $580,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily attributable to a $682,000 decrease in loan related fees.
Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory assessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. OREO-related expenses consist primarily of maintenance and costs of utilities for the OREO inventory, market valuation adjustments, build-out expenses, gains and losses from OREO sales, legal fees, real estate taxes, and insurance related to the properties included in the OREO inventory. Professional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer support services, and other professional services in support of strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease expenses, real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities. Also included in noninterest expense are changes to the Company’s unfunded commitment reserve which are reflected in general and administrative expenses. This unfunded commitment reserve expense can vary significantly each quarter, based on the amount believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable
losses related to unfunded credit facilities, and reflects changes in the amounts that the Company has committed to fund but has not yet disbursed. Our noninterest expenses increased $854,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a $320,000 increase in occupancy and equipment, a $202,000 increase in other noninterest expenses, a $200,000 increase in OREO, and a $198,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a $130,000 decrease in data processing expense.
COVID-19 Related Information
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank is committed to providing assistance to its customers. Under the CARES Act, the Bank provided certain short-term loan modifications. In addition, the Bank participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) as a lender. Some of the PPP loans we originated were for our existing customers, however we also provided PPP loans to those in our community who have not had a banking relationship with us in the past. The initial deadline for PPP loan applications to the SBA was August 8, 2020. Under this program, we funded 462 applications totaling $52.1 million of loans in our market areas and began processing applications for loan forgiveness in the fourth quarter of 2020. The CAA, 2021 renewed and extended the PPP, which ended on May 31, 2021. Under the second round of PPP funding, the Bank originated 261 PPP loans with an aggregate balance of $25.6 million. As of December 31, 2021, there were 67 PPP loans outstanding totaling $10.8 million as compared to 372 PPP loans totaling $41.3 million at December 31, 2020. The SBA released a simplified forgiveness process for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. At December 31, 2021, 39 PPP loans have an outstanding balance of $150,000 or less, totaling $2.0 million, or 18.3% of PPP loans outstanding. Of these PPP loans, 24 loans totaling $484,000, 4.5% of PPP loans, have a balance of $50,000 or less. We will also continue working with our customers to assist them with accessing other borrowing options, including SBA and other government sponsored lending programs, as appropriate.
The CARES Act and related bank regulatory guidance provided that short-term modifications of loans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as defined under the CARES Act prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term modifications (e.g. generally up to 6 months) such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. To qualify as an eligible loan under the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, 2021, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and January 1, 2022. The primary method of relief granted by the Company was to allow the borrower to defer their loan payments for three to six months. Certain borrowers were allowed to pay interest only or have payment deferrals for periods longer than six months depending upon their specific circumstances. Deferred principal and interest amounts were added as a balloon payment due at the original maturity date or payoff of the loan. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had no loans still in deferral status and all loans that previously received loan modifications were current on their loan payments.
Business Strategy
Our long-term business strategy is to operate and grow First Financial Northwest Bank as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank, offering one-to-four family residential, commercial and multifamily, construction/land, consumer and business loans along with a diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise, capital strength, and loan production capability by:
•Capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers, and delivering a consistent, high-quality level of professional service;
•Offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to diversify our deposit mix, growing lower cost deposits, attracting new customers, and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve;
•Utilizing wholesale funding sources, including but not limited to FHLB advances and acquiring deposits in the national brokered certificate of deposit market, to assist with funding needs and interest rate risk management efforts, as needed;
•Managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentration risk and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio;
•Managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin; and
•Improving profitability through disciplined pricing, expense control and balance sheet management, while continuing to provide excellent customer service.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets. The following are our critical accounting policies.
Allowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, policy and underwriting standards, the current and expected economic conditions, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, management’s experience level, the level of problem loans, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, geographic and loan type concentrations, and other external factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory requirements in assessing the ALLL. Loans classified as substandard or placed on nonaccrual status are deemed to be collateral based loans. Specific allowances result when management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when management believes that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled. Based on this impairment analysis, if the recorded investment in the loan is less than the market value of the collateral less costs to sell (“market value”), a specific reserve is established in the ALLL for the loan. The amount of the specific reserve is computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This analysis is inherently subjective as it relies on estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. Loans classified as a TDR due to the borrower being granted a rate concession analyzed by discounted cash flow analysis. The amount of the specific reserve on these loans is calculated by comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the recorded investment in the loan.
Our Board of Directors’ Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends for approval the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis, and any related provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee’s recommendations. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. When analysis of the loan portfolio warrants, the allowance is decreased and a recapture of provision of loan losses is included in current period earnings.
We believe that the ALLL is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period-to-period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of an unexpected large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, thereby reducing earnings. For additional information see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Lending - Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio,” in this Form 10-K.
Valuation of OREO. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale. Accordingly, the valuation of OREO is subject to significant external and internal judgment. If the carrying value of the loan at the date a property is transferred into OREO exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell, the excess is charged to the ALLL. Management periodically reviews OREO values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in the value of OREO are considered valuation adjustments and are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. Expenses and income from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of OREO are included in noninterest expense.
Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs, and write-downs in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless.
When warranted, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards. The level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management’s assessment of our historic and future profitability profile. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax
capacity. For additional information regarding our deferred taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on the Market Value of Investments. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments below their cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of such investments to their fair value. A charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made. Unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other-than-temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer. Other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of a debt security is other-than-temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies; the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position; actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security; the financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisers or market analysts. Therefore, deterioration of market conditions could result in impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio.
Fair Value. Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value.
Derivatives and Hedge Accounting. The Bank recognizes its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedge derivative instruments, and as such, reports the net fair value as an asset or liability. Fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The derivatives are marked to their fair value through other comprehensive income. The net gain or loss on derivatives is reclassified into earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of hedged items.
Intangible Assets. The Company incurred goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset “(CDI”) through the Branch Acquisition during 2017. These assets were booked at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment, with any impairment recognized as noninterest expense. The CDI is amortized into noninterest expense.

Total assets $ 1,426,329 $ 1,387,669 $ 38,660 2.8 %
The $38.7 million increase in total assets during 2021 was primarily a result of $63.8 million of deposit growth providing excess liquidity invested in investments available-for-sale. Additional factors in our asset growth are described below.
Interest-earning deposits with banks. Our interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased by $6.3 million to $66.1 million at December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020. During 2021, a portion of our cash surplus held at the Federal Reserve was reinvested into higher earning assets. We monitor the balance of these funds daily in relation to our expected funding needs.
Investments available-for-sale. During 2021, investments available-for-sale increased $41.4 million, or 32.5%, as excess liquidity generated by retail deposit growth was reinvested into higher yielding available-for-sale securities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased $37.3 million of fixed rate securities and $43.1 million of variable rate securities, with an average yield of 1.58%. Purchases included $34.7 million of mortgage-backed securities, $21.1 million of municipal securities, $12.7 million of U.S. government agency securities, and $12.0 million of corporate bonds. These purchases were partially offset by $20.0 million in proceeds from sales, calls and maturities of securities with an average yield of 2.06%, generating a net gain of $32,000. In addition to the purchase and sale activity, we received principal repayments of $20.0 million on our investments available-for-sale during 2021.
The effective duration of our securities portfolio increased to 3.54% at December 31, 2021 as compared to 2.55% at December 31, 2020. Effective duration measures the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or portfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank’s portfolio includes securities with embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank’s investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change.
Loans receivable. Net loans receivable increased by $2.9 million during 2021 to $1.10 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans increased $34.2 million, one-to-four family loans increased $3.2 million, and construction/land loans increased $1.2 million. In addition, consumer loans increased $4.2 million as the Bank continued to increase its portfolio of classic or collectible car loans. Partially offsetting these increases, business loans decreased $34.1 million, primarily due to a $30.4 million decrease in PPP loans and $4.7 million decrease in aircraft loans. In addition, multifamily loans decreased $6.5 million.
During 2021, we supplemented our loan originations and participations by purchasing $46.4 million in loans, at an average premium of 3.4%. Loans purchased included $20.3 million of performing classic or collectible car loans and $1.7 million of one-to-four family loans. In addition, a pool of 12 loans was purchased, totaling $24.4 million of loans secured by commercial real estate in nine other states, further supporting our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and credit quality objectives.
At December 31, 2021, the Bank had no nonaccrual loans as the $2.1 million nonperforming loan included at December 31, 2020, was paid off in the second quarter of 2021. Included in the payoff settlement were $288,000 in past due interest and $106,000 in late charges, both reported in interest income. In addition, $84,000 of legal fees were reimbursed to the Bank. Nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loans decreased to 0.0% at December 31, 2021, from 0.19% at December 31, 2020. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, increased to $34.2 million at December 31, 2021, from $2.6 million at December 31, 2020. These impaired loans have certain weaknesses as a result of ongoing negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic to the businesses operating in the underlying collateral. The Bank is monitoring these loans closely and does not expect to incur any loss.
The following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets:
December 31, Amount of
Change Percent of
Change
2021 2020
(Dollars in thousands)
Nonperforming loans:
Multifamily $ - $ 2,104 $ (2,104) (100.0) %
Total nonperforming loans - 2,104 (2,104) (100.0)
OREO - 454 (454) (100.0)
Total nonperforming assets $ - $ 2,558 $ (2,558) (100.0) %
We continued to focus on reducing our nonperforming assets through loan work outs or pursuing foreclosure. The Bank had no foregone interest during the year ended December 31, 2021, as the payoff of the $2.1 million loan during 2021 included all past due interest. There was no LIP related to nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021 or 2020. During 2021, two properties that comprised our $454,000 OREO balance at December 31, 2020, were sold, resulting in a loss on sale of $207,000. We did not foreclose on any properties during either 2021 or 2020. The level of our nonperforming assets reflects the modest risk profile of our loan portfolio and our commitment to promptly identify any problem loans and take prompt actions to turn nonperforming assets into performing assets.
Allowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that we use the best information available to establish the ALLL, and that the ALLL as of December 31, 2021 was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ALLL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. Uncertainties relating to our ALLL are heightened as a result of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ALLL was $15.7 million, or 1.40% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2021, as compared to $15.2 million, or 1.36% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2020. The following table details activity and information related to the ALLL for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Intangible assets. As a result of our Branch Acquisition in 2017, the Bank recognized goodwill of $889,000 and a CDI of $1.3 million. Goodwill was calculated as the excess purchase price of the branches over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at August 25, 2017. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2021, and determined that no impairment of goodwill and CDI existed. However, if adverse economic conditions or the decrease in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be deemed sustained rather than temporary, it may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill.
The CDI was provided by a third-party valuation service and represents the fair value of the customer relationships that provide a low-cost source of funding. The analysis was performed on the acquired noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market accounts. The initial ratio of CDI to the acquired balances of core deposits was 2.23%. This amount will amortize into noninterest expense on an accelerated basis over ten years and had a balance of $684,000 at December 31, 2021.
Deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, deposits increased $63.8 million from December 31, 2020. Details of deposit balances and their concentrations are as follows:
December 31,
2021 2020
(Dollars in thousands)
Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 117,751 10.2 % $ 91,285 8.3 %
Interest-bearing demand 97,907 8.5 108,182 9.9
Savings 23,146 2.0 19,221 1.8
Money market 624,543 54.0 465,369 42.6
Certificates of deposit, retail 294,127 25.3 409,576 37.4
Total deposits $ 1,157,474 100.0 % $ 1,093,633 100.0 %
The $63.8 million growth in retail deposits during 2021 was primarily the result of organic deposit growth as we continued to focus on core deposit growth. Money market accounts grew by $159.2 million, due in part to a portion of our retail certificate of deposit customers opting for money market accounts compared to the other options available to them at the maturity of their certificate of deposit. Noninterest-bearing demand accounts grew by $26.5 million due primarily to growth in business checking accounts, and interest-bearing demand accounts decreased by $10.3 million. Partially offsetting this growth,
retail certificates of deposit decreased $115.4 million as continued growth in money market accounts allowed us to reduce our dependence on the higher priced certificates of deposit in an effort to improve our cost of funds and overall deposit mix by becoming less reliant on certificates of deposit.
During 2021, retail deposit balances met our funding needs, therefore we did not need to utilize brokered certificates of deposit. While brokered certificates of deposit may carry a higher cost than our retail certificates, the Bank may utilize this source of funding in the future due to the enhanced call features on some of these deposits that assists us in our efforts to manage our cost of funds and our interest rate risk profile.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we held $60.6 million and $59.2 million in public funds, respectively, of which $21.9 million were retail certificates of deposit. These funds were secured at December 31, 2021 with the Washington State Public Deposit Protection Commission by $23.1 million in pledged investment securities.
Advances. We use advances from the FHLB as an alternative funding source to manage interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet. Total FHLB advances at December 31, 2021 were $95.0 million as compared to $120.0 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, our FHLB advances consisted of $35.0 million of fixed-rate three-month advances that renew quarterly, and $60.0 million of fixed-rate one-month advances that renew monthly, that are utilized in cash flow hedge agreements, as described below. At December 31, 2021, the Bank did not hold any purchased Fed Funds. The availability of overnight FHLB advances provides us flexibility to adjust the level of our borrowings as our funding needs change consistent with our asset/liability objectives. Our average borrowings during 2021 were $115.5 million. At December 31, 2021, all of our FHLB advances were due to mature in less than two months.
Cash Flow Hedge. To assist in managing interest rate risk, the Bank entered into seven interest rate swap agreements with qualified institutions designated as cash flow hedge instruments. The agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $95.0 million, with individual notional amounts ranging from $10.0 million to $15.0 million, a weighted-average remaining term of 4.9 years and a weighted-average fixed rate of 1.05%. The remaining maturity of these agreements is from 22 months to eight years. On October 25, 2021, a $50.0 million notional swap with a fixed rate of 1.34% matured and was partially replaced with two previously contracted forward-starting interest rate swap agreements of $15.0 million and $10.0 million, effective on that date. These swaps had an original weighted-average term of 7.4 years and a weighted-average fixed rate of 0.80%.
Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Bank pays a fixed interest rate and in return receives an interest payment based on the corresponding LIBOR index, which resets quarterly or monthly, depending on the hedge term. Concurrently, the Bank borrowed a fixed rate FHLB advance that will be renewed quarterly or monthly, as designated by the hedge agreement, at the fixed interest rate at that time. Effectiveness of the interest rate swap is evaluated quarterly with any ineffectiveness recognized as a gain or a loss on the income statement in noninterest income. A change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge created by the interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an other asset or other liability on the balance sheet with the tax-effected portion of the change included in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, we recognized a $1.5 million fair value asset as a result of the increase in market value of the interest rate swap agreements.
The Bank has confirmed our adherence to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) 2020 LIBOR Fallbacks Protocol (“Protocol”) to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR by June 30, 2023. The Protocol provides a mechanism for parties to bilaterally amend their existing derivatives transactions to incorporate ISDA’s fallback terms, providing for a clear transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
Stockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity increased to $157.9 million at December 31, 2021, from $156.3 million at December 31, 2020. Increases to stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2021, included $12.2 million of net income and $2.4 million in net stock-based compensation. In addition, improvements in the fair value of our derivatives and available-for-sale investments resulted in $2.1 million in other comprehensive income. The exercise of stock options resulted in the issuance of 41,000 shares of common stock and a $344,000 increase to additional paid-in capital.
These increases were partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease to additional paid-in-capital from the repurchase and retirement of 704,950 shares at an average price of $16.11 per share. In addition, shareholder cash dividends of $0.44 per share were paid during 2021, reducing retained earnings by $4.1 million.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Net Interest Income. Net interest income in 2021 was $45.0 million, a $4.5 million or 11.1% increase from $40.5 million in 2020, due primarily to a $6.8 million decrease in interest expense partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in
interest income. Interest income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the decrease in average yield on interest-earning assets to 4.01% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.36% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as the ongoing historically low interest rate environment continues to put downward pressure on asset yields. Average interest-earning assets increased $55.5 million, partially funded by a $18.9 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of these funds decreased to 0.78% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the low interest rate environment and an improvement in the Company’s deposit mix as the average balance of our higher cost certificate of deposit declined by $88.0 million. Average balances in lower cost money market accounts, interest-bearing demand and statement savings accounts increased by $130.1 million, $13.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively. In addition, average balances in noninterest-bearing accounts increased by $37.1 million. The resulting impact was an improvement in our net interest margin to 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 3.15% for the year ended December 31, 2020. For more information, see “Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk.”

Total interest-earning assets $ 1,341,635 4.01 % $ 1,286,181 4.36 % $ (2,316)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the $2.4 million decrease in loan interest income reflects decreases in both the average yield and balance of loans. The average loan yield decreased to 4.57% from 4.69% and the average balance of loans receivable decreased $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to PPP loan repayments. Yields on loans continue to decline as loans are originated or refinanced at lower rates or adjust downward in this continued low interest rate environment, however, prepayments of PPP loans and amounts forgiven by the SBA had a favorable increase to the loan yield for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to recognition of $2.0 million of unamortized fees and costs. At December 31, 2021, the balance of net deferred loan fees relating to PPP loans to be recognized in future periods totaled $258,000.
Interest income from investments available-for-sale was stable with a $27,000 increase during 2021, as a $42.4 million increase in the average balance of these investments compensated for the reduction in average yield to 1.84% from 2.42% for the prior year. Over half of our investment portfolio was comprised of variable rate securities which repriced during the continued low interest rate environment during 2021.
Interest income on interest-earning deposits increased $20,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of a $35.4 million increase in the average balance of these deposits, partially offset by a reduction in their yield to 0.12% for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 0.21% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 1,131,318 0.78 % $ 1,112,461 1.41 % $ (6,826)
Interest expense decreased $6.8 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense during 2021 was primarily a result of the decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.71% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 1.42% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, although the average balance of our interest-bearing deposits increased $28.8 million during 2021, the growth in lower cost deposits, primarily money market accounts, allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost retail certificates of deposit and reduce our overall interest expense
Money market interest expense decreased by $1.9 million as a result of a 55 basis point decrease in the average cost of these funds partially offset by a $130.1 million increase in the average balance. The cost of retail certificates of deposit decreased by 59 basis points as maturing deposits repriced down in the continued low interest rate environment.
Our FHLB advances are all short-term and matched to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements, resulting in a relatively stable average cost of these funds of 1.39% and 1.31% for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. This slight increase in average cost was offset by the repayment of $25.0 million in FHLB advances in October 2021 as a result of a corresponding reduction in related interest rate swap agreements, resulting in a $37,000 decrease in total interest expense for borrowings.
Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses was $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This provision, combined with recoveries of $183,000, resulted in a $483,000 increase in the ALLL to total loans to 1.40% at December 31, 2021, from 1.36% at December 31, 2020. The provision for loan losses in 2021 was primarily a result of a $2.1 million increase in net loans receivable, and a change in the composition of our loan portfolio as $30.4 million in repaid PPP loans omitted from our loan loss allowance analysis were replaced with other loans included in the analysis, offsetting the impact from decreased historical loss factors and qualitative factors for certain loan categories as the expected economic impact as a result of the COVD-19 pandemic to the credit quality of our loan portfolio has diminished this year. At December 31, 2021, the $10.8 million balance of PPP loans was omitted from the ALLL calculation as these loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and management expects that the majority of remaining PPP borrowers will seek full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations from the SBA within a short time frame, which will in turn reimburse the Bank for the amount forgiven. In addition, the provision for loan losses was impacted by the $31.6 million increase in substandard loans and the $14.7 million increase in impaired loans during 2021 evaluated for specific reserves and omitted from the general reserve calculations used to calculate the ALLL and provision for loan losses. As noted above, our individual evaluation of our impaired loans indicated no additional specific reserve was needed.
In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a provision of $1.9 million, primarily the result of the downgrade in the loan risk ratings of $61.0 million of loans, primarily loans receiving an additional COVID-19 related payment deferral under the CARES Act combined with increases in probable loan losses for all loan categories in response to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher potential impact allocated to commercial real estate and construction/land portfolios.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $580,000 to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income:
Year Ended
December 31, 2021 Change from
December 31, 2020 Percentage
Change
(Dollars in thousands)
Gain on sale of investments, net $ 32 $ (54) (62.8) %
BOLI change in cash surrender value 1,107 125 12.7
Wealth management revenue 494 (169) (25.5)
Deposit related fees 872 117 15.5
Loan related fees 1,265 (682) (35.0)
Other 92 83 922.2
Total noninterest income $ 3,862 $ (580) (13.1) %
The largest change to our noninterest income was the $682,000 decrease on loan related fees for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a $430,000 decrease in fees on loan interest rate swap agreements. The Bank has an interest rate swap program for commercial loan customers, under which the customer participates in an interest rate swap with a third-party institution for which the Bank receives a fee that is recognized at the time the loan is originated. Due to the reduced customer demand for these interest rate swaps, there were no new agreements originated in 2021. In addition, fees collected on the early payoff of certain loans decreased $215,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Wealth management revenue decreased by $169,000 in 2021, primarily as a result of reduced sales staff during much of 2021 and timing differences in revenue recognition. This line of business assists the Bank with providing options to our customers to more fully support their financial needs. Total assets managed by our wealth management division increased to $112.7 million at December 31, 2021, from $88.0 million at December 31, 2020.
In addition, sales of investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulted in a gain of $32,000. In comparison, sales of investments for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulted in an $86,000 gain. Partially offsetting these decreases, deposit related fees of $872,000 were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $117,000 increase over the prior year, primarily from debit card related service fees reflecting increased usage as the economy improves in our markets. In addition, our BOLI noninterest income increased $125,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to $161,000 in death benefits proceeds. The $1.1 million of noninterest BOLI income also included the net increase in cash surrender value of these policies, which assists in offsetting expenses for employee benefits.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $854,000 to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense:
Year Ended
December 31, 2021 Change from
December 31, 2020 Percentage
Change
(Dollars in thousands)
Salaries and employee benefits $ 20,237 $ 198 1.0 %
Occupancy and equipment 4,557 320 7.6
Professional fees 1,899 192 11.2
Data processing 2,692 (130) (4.6)
OREO related expenses, net 209 200 2,222.2
Regulatory assessments 456 (91) (16.6)
Insurance and bond premiums 451 6 1.3
Marketing 154 (43) (21.8)
Other general and administrative 2,712 202 8.0
Total noninterest expense $ 33,367 $ 854 2.6 %
The primary contributor to the increase in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, was a $320,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense. Lease expense increased $125,000 primarily due to our most recent branch opening in March 2021 and two branches opened late in 2020. In addition, depreciation expense increased $115,000 and facilities and equipment maintenance increased $102,000 as a result of maintenance and improvements at branch locations.
Salary and employee benefits increased by $198,000 to $20.2 million due in part to a $779,000 net increase in stock based compensation as a result of the increase in common stock priced used to calculate the expense for ESOP shares allocated to employees for 2021 and restricted stock awards granted during the year. Partially offsetting this increase, salaries, commissions and employee incentives decreased $555,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting a decrease in staffing.
Further contributing to the increase in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, professional fees increased $192,000. The primary factor was a $319,000 increase in other professional services as we outsourced recruiting and other services. Partially offsetting this increase, legal fees decreased $129,000, primarily due to the receipt of $84,000 of reimbursed legal fees at the payoff of a $2.1 million nonaccrual loan.
The sale of two OREO properties during 2021 resulted in a $207,000 loss on sale included in noninterest expense, a $200,000 increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Partially offsetting these increases, data processing expense decreased $130,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as additional expense was incurred during 2020 in support of a new online banking platform. In addition, regulatory assessments decreased $91,000, primarily due to the change in composition of our loan portfolio, as PPP loans are excluded from our asset base for calculation of our FDIC assessment.
Federal Income Tax Expense. We recorded a $2.9 million federal income tax provision for 2021, compared to $1.9 million for 2020. The increase in federal income tax provision for 2021 was primarily the result of a $4.7 million increase in pretax net income.

Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. Information is provided with respect to: (1) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); and (2) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes in rate/volume are allocated proportionately to the changes in rate and volume.

Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk
General. Our Board of Directors has approved an asset/liability management policy to guide management in maximizing interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate risk, credit risk, and profitability. The policy established an Investment, Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) comprised of certain members of senior management and the Board of Directors. The Committee’s purpose is to communicate, coordinate and manage our asset/liability position consistent with our business plan and Board-approved policies. The ALCO meets quarterly to review various areas including:
•economic conditions;
•interest rate outlook;
•asset/liability mix;
•interest rate risk sensitivity;
•current market opportunities to promote specific products;
•historical financial results;
•projected financial results; and
•capital position.
The Committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs. As part of its procedures, the Committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution’s existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in the market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the Board of Directors.
Our Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk.
We have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk:
•we are originating shorter term, higher yielding loans, whenever possible;
•we have attempted, where possible, to increase balances of non-maturity deposits with less rate sensitivity;
•we have invested in securities with relatively short average lives, generally less than eight years;
•we have added adjustable-rate loans to our loan portfolio;
•we may utilize brokered certificates of deposit with a call option as a funding source; and
•we have utilized interest rate swaps to effectively fix the rate on $95.0 million of FHLB advances.
How We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes. We monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis by measuring the impact of changes to net interest income in multiple rate environments. Management retains the services of a third-party consultant with over 30 years of experience in asset-liability management to assist in its interest rate risk and asset-liability management. Management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates. Although management believes these assumptions are reasonable, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual results differ from these assumptions. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react differently to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates. Non-uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, a portion of our adjustable-rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan’s contractual interest rate may not adjust. Approximately 57.2% of our net loans were adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2021. At that date, $444.0 million, or 69.3%, of these loans with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.27% were at their floor interest rate. A portion of these loans are set to reprice at defined time intervals. Adjustable rate loans that are based on prime rate plus a specified margin recalculate each time the prime rate changes. When the floor rate is above a prime rate based loan’s fully indexed rate, the Bank will not receive the benefit of an increasing market rates until prime rate increases enough where the fully indexed rate exceeds the loans floor rate. At December 31, 2021, the Bank’s net loans receivable included $117.0 million of prime based loans, of which $104.4 million were at a floor rate that exceeded their fully indexed rate.
The following table shows the rate increase that would need to occur on these loans before the Bank receives the benefit of a floating rate:

The inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates. However, when loans are at their floors, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure.
The assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions. These assumptions relate to interest rates, prepayments, deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios. We use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans, investments and borrowings and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits. Time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities. We also assume that non-maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates, based upon our historical deposit decay rates, which are substantially lower than market decay rates. We have observed in the past that our deposit accounts during changing rate environments have relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes. When interest rates rise, we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits. These assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base, competitive factors, and historical experience.
Our income simulation model examines changes in net interest income in scenarios where interest rates were assumed to remain at their base level, instantaneously increase by 100, 200 and 300 basis points or decline immediately by 100 basis points. A decline by 200 and 300 basis points is not reported as the current targeted federal funds rate is between 0.00% and 0.25%.
The following table illustrates the estimated change in our net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2021, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement. The net interest income in an up 100 basis point move would decline slightly in year one and increase under larger immediate increases in interest rates. The slight decline would be due to the level of adjustable-rate loans that are currently at their floor rate. The $444.0 million of loans at their floor rate would not experience the full impact of a 100 basis point increase in rates because the fully-indexed rate is below the floor rate that is currently in effect for many of these loans.

(1)No rates in the model are allowed to go below zero. Given the relatively low level of market interest rates, a calculation for a decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared.
(2)The net portfolio value is the difference between the present value of the discounted cash flows of assets and liabilities and represents the market value of the Company’s equity for any given interest rate scenario. Net portfolio value is useful for determining, on a market value basis, how equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios. Large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams.
(3)The increase or decrease in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates.
(4)Net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets.
(5)The increase or decrease in the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets.
(6)The market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes.
The net interest income and net portfolio value tables presented above are predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in asset or liability mix. In addition, the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows. The effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and assuming that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Delinquency rates may change when interest rates change as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix, underwriting conditions, loan terms or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio. Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as assumed. Also, a change in U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the Treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. We maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows. On a daily basis, we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits, scheduled loan and investment repayments, including interest payments, maturing loans and investment securities, and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with equity, are used to fund loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We believe that our current liquidity position, and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits or agency or mortgage-backed securities. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under Item 1. “Business - Lending Activities.” At December 31, 2021, the undisbursed portion of construction LIP totaled $43.4 million and unused lines of credit
were $34.0 million. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of deposit and withdrawals on other deposit accounts, to fund loan commitments, and to maintain our portfolio of investment securities. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2021, totaled $145.3 million. Management’s policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on historical experience, we believe that a significant portion of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with First Financial Northwest Bank. As further funding sources, we had the ability at December 31, 2021 to borrow an additional $327.5 million from the FHLB, based on our collateral capacity, $84.8 million from the FRB, and $75.0 million from unused lines of credit with other financial institutions to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this report for further details on our cash flow activities.
We measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due. Liquidity (and funding) risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices, or in a reasonable time frame, to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations. We regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage our liquidity and funding requirements.
Our primary source of funds is our retail deposits. When retail deposits are not sufficient to provide the funds for our assets, or if other sources are available with more favorable rates or structure, we use alternative funding sources. These sources include, but are not limited to, advances from the FHLB, wholesale funding, brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, and dealer repurchase agreements, as well as other short-term alternatives. We may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs.
On a monthly basis, we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the next twelve months. Also, we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits. This information is used by our Asset/Liability Management Committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities.
We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations.
Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2022 we expect cash expenditures of $1.3 million for capital investment in property, plant and equipment. In addition, we currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.12 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2022 at this rate of $0.12 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately $1.1 million, based on the number of our current outstanding shares (which assumes no increases or decreases in the number of shares, except in connection with the anticipated vesting of currently outstanding equity awards).
For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, we project that our fixed commitments will include (i) $840,000 of operating lease payments and (ii) other future obligations and accrued expenses of $12.2 million. At December 31, 2021, our $95.0 million in FHLB borrowings are all short-term and tied to interest rate swap agreements and are expected to be renewed as they mature during 2022. We believe that our liquid assets combined with the available lines of credit provide adequate liquidity to meet our current financial obligations for at least the next 12 months.
Our total stockholders’ equity was $157.9 million at December 31, 2021. Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain the Bank as a “well capitalized” institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2021, First Financial Northwest Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital ratios for First Financial Northwest Bank were as follows as of December 31, 2021: Total capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.48%; Tier 1 capital and Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.23%; and Tier 1 capital to total assets was 10.34%. At December 31, 2021, First Financial Northwest Bank met the financial ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. “Business - How We Are Regulated - Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Capital Requirements.”
The Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) component of capital includes a variety of items, including the value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio and the value of our derivative instruments, net of tax. We model various interest rate scenarios that could impact these elements of AOCI and believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand the estimated potential fluctuations in a variety of interest rate environments.
