Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties.
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “project” and similar expressions, or words that, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus.
Although the forward-looking statements in this annual report on Form 10-K reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in herein and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (USD or US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. All references to “common stock” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
Financing Needs
In order to fund our operations, we rely upon direct investments, partnerships and joint ventures with accredited investors. Once the Company becomes profitable, we intend to fund our operations from free cash flow.
At present, the Company only has sufficient funds to conduct its operations for two to three months. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.
If we are not successful in generating sufficient liquidity from Company operations or in raising sufficient capital resources, on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations liquidity and financial condition.
The Company presently does not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Due to its brief history under its current business model and historical operating losses, the Company’s operations have not been a source of liquidity. The Company will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable. In order to obtain capital, the Company may need to sell additional shares of its common stock or borrow funds from private lenders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional funding.
The Company will need additional investments in order to continue operations. Additional investments are being sought, but the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain such investments. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. In the event there is a downturn in the U.S. stock and debt markets, this could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if the Company is able to raise the funds required, it is possible that it could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to it, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force it to seek alternative financing. Further, if the Company issues additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders.
Results from Operations - For the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.
Our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 are summarized below:
Revenues
Since our inception on January 20, 1999, we have generated minimal revenue from our operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. We have limited financial resources and limited operations until such time that we are able to begin to generate revenue from our own operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business plan through the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC and the formation of Markets on Main, LLC, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us and risks associated with the implementation of our business strategies.
For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we generated $124,506 and $15,000 in revenue, respectively. Our revenue for the year ended June 30, 2022 was comprised from consulting services and sales of the Company’s Sculpt Baby product. Our revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 was 100% comprised of consulting revenue with one customer.
For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, our cost of goods sold was $13,000 and $0, respectively. The makeup of the cost of goods sold for the year ended June 30, 2022 was 100% comprised of costs for the sale of the Company’s Sculpt Baby product.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses were $610,794 and $366,804 for years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 is largely attributable to the increase in officer and director compensation.
We incurred $0 and $0 in advertising expenses for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We incurred $80,000 and $80,000 (including $40,000 stock-based compensation) in officer and director related expenses for years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company anticipates that these expenses will increase during fiscal 2023 as the Company expands the operations of Markets on Main and the closing of the acquisition of Tersus Power, Inc.
Loss from Operations
The Company’s loss from operations increased to ($499,288) for the year ended June 30, 2022 from ($351,804) in 2021, an increase of $147,484. The increase in loss from operations is largely attributable to an increase in operating expenses during the year ended June 30, 2022.
Other Income (Expenses)
Other Income (Expenses) included interest expense, interest income, gain (loss) on derivative liability, forgiveness of debt and accrued interest, impairment of goodwill, loss on issuance of convertible notes and amortization of debt discounts in the amount of ($779,0278) during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to ($3,876,857) the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in other income (expenses) during the year ended June 30, 2022 is largely attributable to the Company’s decrease in loss on issuance of convertible notes and amortization of debt discounts.
Net Income (Loss)
For the year ended June 30, 2022, our net loss decreased to ($1,278,315), as compared to a net loss of ($4,228,661) for the year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $2,950,346. The decrease in net loss is largely attributable to the Company’s decrease in other income (expenses) and increase in revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash on Hand
Our cash on hand as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 was $324,494 and $56,300, respectively.
We currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions or off-balance sheet arrangements that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital.
We are dependent on the sale of our securities or issuance of debt to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees.
If we are unable to raise the funds, we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need for our operations from the sale of our securities. We have not located any sources for these funds and may not be able to do so in the future. We expect that we will seek additional financing in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If we fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. Please see NOTE M- GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY for further information.
