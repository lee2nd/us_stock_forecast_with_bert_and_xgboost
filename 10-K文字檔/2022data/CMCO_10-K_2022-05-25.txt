Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition
This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
The Company is a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of intelligent motion solutions, including motion control products, technologies, automated systems and services, that efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure materials. Our key products include hoists, crane components, precision conveyors, actuators, rigging tools, light rail workstations, and digital power and motion control systems. These are highly relevant, professional-grade solutions that solve customers’ critical material handling requirements.
Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions. We developed our leading market position over our 147-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior customer service. In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base. In accordance with our Blueprint for Growth 2.0 Strategy, we are simplifying the business utilizing our 80/20 process, improving our operational excellence, and ramping the growth engine by investing in new product development and a digital platform to grow profitably. We believe shareholder value will be enhanced by expanding EBITDA margins and return on invested capital ("ROIC").
Our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 41% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2022. We believe this diversity balances the impact of changes that occur in local economies, as well as benefits the Company by providing access to growing emerging markets. We monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as well as the ISM Production Index as indicators of anticipated demand for our products. In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including, industrial production, trade tariffs, raw material cost inflation, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
From a strategic perspective, we are investing in new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth. We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments, actuators, and digital power and motion control systems for the material handling industry. We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including general industrial, energy, automotive, heavy OEM, entertainment, and construction and infrastructure.
In March 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dorner. The acquisition of Dorner closed on April 7, 2021. Dorner, headquartered in Hartland, Wisconsin, is a leading automation solutions company providing unique, patented technologies in the design, application, manufacturing and integration of high-precision conveying systems. Dorner is a leading supplier to the stable life sciences, food processing, and consumer packaged goods markets as well as the high growth industrial automation and e-commerce sectors. The addition of Dorner provides attractive complementary adjacencies including sortation and asynchronous conveyance systems.
Further, on December 1, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Garvey. Garvey is a leading accumulation systems solutions company providing unique, patented systems for the automation of production processes whose products complement those of Dorner. The acquisitions of Dorner and Garvey accelerate the Company’s shift to intelligent motion and serve as a platform to expand capabilities in advanced, higher technology automation solutions.
Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness. We have specific initiatives to reduce quote lead-times, improve on-time deliveries, reduce warranty costs, and improve material and factory productivity. The initiatives are being driven by the implementation of our business operating system, CMBS. We are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through business simplification, operational excellence, and profitable growth initiatives. We believe these initiatives will enhance future operating margins.
Our principal raw materials and components purchases were approximately $368 million in fiscal 2022 (or 62% of Cost of product sold) and include steel, consisting of rod, wire, bar, structural, and other forms of steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components; and standard variable drives and controls. These commodities are all available from multiple sources. We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group. Currently, as a result of global supply chain challenges, we are experiencing higher raw material costs and availability issues for select raw materials and components. To date, we have raised prices to our
customers to cover these increased raw material costs and are working with our supply base to prioritize shipments and improve availability of key components.
We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment. The Company is moving from its past as an industrial company to a top-tier intelligent motion company. We have refocused our Company on faster growing markets as demonstrated by the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions. We are benefiting from increased trends for safety, industrial automation, manufacturing on-shoring and workforce productivity initiatives. Our long-term growth strategy is supported by our strong free cash flow as well as our liquidity position and flexible debt structure.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion is a comparison between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 results. For a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on May 26, 2021.
Fiscal 2022 Compared to 2021
Fiscal 2022 sales were $906,555,000, an increase of 39.5%, or $256,913,000 compared with fiscal 2021 sales of $649,642,000. Sales for the fiscal year were positively impacted by $144,587,000 of incremental sales from the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions as well as increased sales volume of $89,955,000 and price increases of $20,002,000. Favorable foreign currency translation also increased sales by $2,369,000.
Gross profit was $315,730,000 and $220,225,000 or 34.8% and 33.9% of net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fiscal 2022 increase in gross profit of $95,505,000 or 43.4% is the result of the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions, which added $53,627,000 of gross profit net of acquisition related costs, $30,746,00 in higher sales volume, $10,551,000 in higher productivity net of other manufacturing cost increases, $5,953,000 of price increases net of material inflation and $2,671,000 in prior year factory closure costs which did not recur. These increases were offset by $3,045,000 in increased product liability costs, $2,627,000 in increased tariffs costs, $2,189,000 from a gain recorded in the prior year for a building sold in China classified as Cost of products sold that did not recur, and $776,000 in increased severance costs in fiscal 2022. The translation of foreign currencies had a $594,000 favorable impact on gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2022.
Selling expenses were $99,187,000 and $76,907,000, or 10.9% and 11.8% of net sales in fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Selling expense increased $15,161,000 as a result of the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions. The remaining increase is due to variable selling costs as the Company continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation had a $304,000 unfavorable impact on selling expenses.
General and administrative expenses were $102,128,000 and $76,035,000 or 11.3% and 11.7% of net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions adding $10,596,000 of ongoing general and administrative costs and $5,625,000 of acquisition deal costs. In addition, general and administrative costs increased $4,868,000 due to higher incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense. Foreign currency translation had a $238,000 unfavorable impact on general and administrative expenses.
Research and development expenses were $15,351,000 and $12,405,000 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 1.7% and 1.9% in fiscal 2022 and 2021. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to $1,722,000 of acquisition and acquisition related costs and $456,000 in higher incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense. Foreign currency translation had a $15,000 unfavorable impact on research and development expenses.
Amortization of intangibles were $25,283,000 and $12,623,000 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the increase related to new intangible assets recorded from the Dorner and Garvey acquisition.
Interest and debt expense was $20,126,000 and $12,081,000 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase is related to higher interest rates as well as higher average borrowing outstanding as a result of the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions.
The Company incurred $14,803,000 in Cost of debt refinancing in fiscal 2022 as a result of the Dorner acquisition and related refinancing as described in Note 12 to our March 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements. There were no similar expenses incurred in fiscal 2021.
Investment income of $46,000 and $1,693,000, in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to earnings on marketable securities held in the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and the Company's equity method investment in EMC, described in Note 7 to our March 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency exchange resulted in a loss of $1,574,000 and $941,000 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of foreign currency volatility related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases and intercompany debt.
Other income was $1,122,000 in fiscal 2022 and other expense was $20,850,000 in fiscal 2021. The decrease in expense is primarily related to a $19,038,000 settlement charge as a result of the termination of one of the Company's U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2021 as described in Note 13 to our March 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income tax expense was 22.9% and 9.6% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Typically these percentages vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to varying effective tax rates at the Company's foreign subsidiaries and the jurisdictional mix of income for these subsidiaries. In fiscal 2021 the tax rate was primarily reduced by 6.9 percentage points primarily due to federal tax credits including research and development tax credits.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $115,640,000 and $202,377,000, at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $48,881,000 and $98,890,000 in fiscal 2022, and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, net income of $29,660,000 and non-cash adjustments to net income of $76,266,000 were the largest contributors. Of the non-cash adjustments, $41,924,000 was Depreciation and amortization and $14,803,000 was Cost of debt refinancing as a result of the Dorner acquisition. Net working capital increases reduced operating cash flows by $45,859,000, which included an increase of $40,201,000 in inventories as the Company increased inventory due to current supply chain constraints and an increase in trade accounts receivable of $18,988,000 attributable to strong fourth quarter sales. This was partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable of $12,681,000. In addition non-current liabilities decreased by $11,211,000. The decrease in non-current liabilities primarily consists of $9,059,000 in cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities for fiscal 2022.
Cash flow from investing activities
Net cash used for investing activities was $554,311,000 and $5,548,000 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the most significant use of cash in investing activities was $539,778,000 to purchase Dorner and Garvey, net of cash acquired, as well as $13,104,000 in capital expenditures.
Cash flow from by financing activities
Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $420,700,000 and $(10,189,000) in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the most significant sources of cash were $725,000,000 in gross proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and $207,000,000 in gross proceeds from an equity offering, which were used to fund the Dorner and Garvey acquisitions. These sources of cash were offset by $477,846,000 in repayments of debt, $26,184,000 in fees related to the debt and equity offering, and dividends paid in the amount of $6,562,000. As noted in Note 8 of the financial statements, during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company modified its cross currency swap and interest rate swap. As such, the associated cash flows from hedging activities are classified as financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $789,000.
We believe that our cash on hand, cash flows, and borrowing capacity under our new First Lien Facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and debt obligations, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. This belief is dependent upon successful execution of our current business plan and effective working capital utilization. No material restrictions exist in accessing cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Additionally we expect to meet our U.S. funding needs without repatriating non-U.S. cash and incurring incremental U.S. taxes. As of March 31, 2022, $75,284,000 of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries.
On January 31, 2017 the Company entered into a Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") and $545,000,000 of debt facilities ("Facilities") in connection with the STAHL acquisition. The Facilities consist of a Revolving Facility ("Revolver") in the
amount of $100,000,000 and a $445,000,000 1st Lien Term Loan ("Term Loan"). The Term Loan has a seven-year term maturing in 2024. On August 26, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended by the First Amended Credit Agreement, dated as of February 26, 2018). The Second Amended Credit Agreement extended the $100,000,000 secured Revolver which was originally set to expire on January 31, 2022 to August 25, 2023.
As discussed in Note 3, the Company completed its acquisition of Dorner on April 7, 2021 and entered into a $750,000,000 First Lien Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, PNC Capital Markets LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities LLC. The First Lien Facilities consist of a Revolving Facility in an aggregate amount of $100,000,000 and a $650,000,000 Bridge Facility. Proceeds from the Bridge Facility were used, among other things, to finance the purchase price for the Dorner acquisition, pay related fees, expenses and transaction costs, and refinance the Company's borrowings under its prior Term Loan and Revolver.
In addition to the debt borrowing described above, the Company commenced and completed an underwritten public offering of 4,312,500 shares of its common stock at a price of $48.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $207,000,000. The Company used all of the net proceeds from the equity offering to repay part of its outstanding borrowings under its Bridge Facility. The equity offering closed on May 4, 2021. Following the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Facility, the Bridge Facility was refinanced with a syndicated Term Loan B facility on May 14, 2021.
The key terms of the Term Loan B facility are as follows:
1) Term Loan B: An aggregate $450,000,000 Term Loan B facility, which requires quarterly principal amortization of 0.25% with the remaining principal due at the maturity date. In addition, if the Company has Excess Cash Flow (ECF) as defined in the Credit Agreement for the First Lien Facility (the “Credit Agreement”), the ECF Percentage of the Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year minus optional prepayments of the Loans (except prepayments of Revolving Loans that are not accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction of Revolving Commitments) pursuant to Section 2.10(a) of the Credit Agreement other than to the extent that any such prepayment is funded with the proceeds of Funded Debt, shall be applied toward the prepayment of the Term Loan B facility. The ECF Percentage is defined as 50% stepping down to 25% or 0% based on the achievement of specified Secured Leverage Ratios as of the last day of such fiscal year. Further, the Company may draw additional Incremental Facilities (referred to as an "Accordion") by executing and delivering to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. an Increased Facility Activation Notice specifying the amount of such increase requested. Lenders shall have no obligation to participate in any increase unless they agree to do so in their sole discretion.
2) Revolver: An aggregate $100,000,000 secured revolving facility which includes sublimits for the issuance of standby letters of credit, swingline loans and multi-currency borrowings in certain specified foreign currencies.
3) Fees and Interest Rates: Commitment fees and interest rates are determined on the basis of either a Eurocurrency rate or a Base rate plus an applicable margin, which is based upon the Company's Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the case of Revolver loans.
4) Prepayments: Provisions permitting a Borrower to voluntarily prepay either the Term Loan B facility or Revolver in whole or in part at any time, and provisions requiring certain mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan B facility or Revolver on the occurrence of certain events which will permanently reduce the commitments under the Credit Agreement, each without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs of the Lenders.
5) Covenants: Provisions containing covenants required of the Company and its subsidiaries including various affirmative and negative financial and operational covenants. The key financial covenant is triggered only on any date when any Extension of Credit under the New Revolving Credit Facility is outstanding (excluding any Letters of Credit) (the “Covenant Trigger”), and prohibits the Total Leverage Ratio for the Reference Period ended on such date from exceeding (i) 6.75:1.00 as of any date of determination prior to June 30, 2021, (ii) 5.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2021 and thereafter but prior to June 30, 2022, (iii) 4.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2022 and thereafter but prior to June 30, 2023 and (iv) 3.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2023 and thereafter.
6) Collateral: Obligations under the First Lien Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries.
In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred $14,803,000 in debt extinguishment costs of which $5,946,000 relates to the Company's prior Term Loan, $326,000 relates to the Company's prior Revolver, and $8,531,000 relates to fees paid on the portion of the First Lien Facilities that were associated with the Bridge Facility, all of which were incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These costs are classified as Cost of debt refinancing in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Further, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $5,432,000 in deferred financing costs on the First Lien Term Facility, which will be amortized over seven years. The Company recorded $4,027,000 in deferred financings costs on the New Revolving Credit Facility, of which $3,050,000 is related to the New Revolving Credit Facility and $977,000 is carried over from the Company's prior Revolver as certain Revolver lenders increased their borrowing capacity. These balances will be amortized over five years and are classified in Other assets since no funds were drawn on the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Also discussed in Note 3, the Company completed its acquisition of Garvey on November 30, 2021 and borrowed additional funds in accordance with the Accordion feature under its existing Term Loan B to increase the principal amount of the Term Loan B facility by $75,000,000. Proceeds from the Accordion were used, among other things, to finance the purchase price for the Garvey acquisition, pay related fees, expenses, and transaction costs. No material amendment to the terms of the Term Loan B facility or the First Lien Facility was necessary for the Company to exercise this Accordion feature.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $892,000 in deferred financing costs on the Accordion, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the Term Loan B.
The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan B facility was $502,560,000 as of March 31, 2022, which includes $75,000,000 in principal balance from the Accordion exercised in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was $254,900,000 as of March 31, 2021. The Company made $22,440,000 of principal payment on the Term Loan B during fiscal 2022 and $4,450,000 of principal payment on the Term Loan during fiscal 2021. The Company is obligated to make $5,260,000 of principal payments on the Term Loan B facility over the next 12 months plus applicable ECF payments, if required, however, plans to pay down approximately $40,000,000 in principal payments in total during such 12 month period. This amount has been recorded within the current portion of long term debt on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet with the remaining balance recorded as long term debt.
There were no outstanding borrowings and $17,151,000 outstanding letters of credit issued against the New Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2022. The outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2022 consisted of $849,000 in commercial letters of credit and $16,302,000 of standby letters of credit.
The gross balance of deferred financing costs on the Term Loan B facility was $6,323,000, which includes $892,000 from the Accordion exercise, as of March 31, 2022, and $14,690,000 on the prior Term Loan as of March 31, 2021, respectively. The accumulated amortization balances were $898,000 and $8,744,000 as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The gross balance of deferred financing costs associated with the New Revolving Credit Facility was $4,027,000 as of March 31, 2022 and the prior Revolver was $3,615,000 as of March 31, 2021, which are included in Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The accumulated amortization balance is $805,000 and $2,313,000 as of March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, respectively.
In connection with Dorner acquisition, the Company recorded a finance lease for a manufacturing facility in Hartland, WI under a 23 year lease agreement which terminates in 2035. The outstanding balance on the finance lease obligation is $14,084,000 as of March 31, 2022 of which $544,000 has been recorded within the Current portion of long term debt and the remaining balance recorded within Term loan and finance lease obligations on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 18, Leases, for further details.
Non-U.S. Lines of Credit and Loans
Unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short-term working capital needs for certain of our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. The lines of credit are available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants, and events of default, as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction. As of March 31, 2022, unsecured credit lines totaled approximately $2,434,000, of which $0 was drawn. In addition, unsecured lines of $12,503,000 were available for bank guarantees issued in the normal course of business of which $9,135,000 was utilized.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements, enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were $13,104,000 and $12,300,000, respectively. Excluded from fiscal 2022 capital expenditures is
$329,000 and $730,000, in property, plant and equipment purchases included in accounts payable at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2023 to range from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000.
INFLATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS
Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America, and Asia-Pacific. We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented despite rising inflation due to our ability to pass on rising costs through price increases. We are currently experiencing higher raw material, freight, and logistics costs than we have seen in recent years, which we have been able to recover with pricing actions. In the future, we may not be able to pass on these cost increases to our customers.
SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS
Quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, legal settlements, gains or losses in our portfolio of marketable securities, restructuring charges, favorable or unfavorable foreign currency translation, divestitures and acquisitions. Therefore, the operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates. If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results. We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements. Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
Insurance Reserves. Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses, and increased limit factors. These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations. Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements. Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing. Our goodwill balance of $648,849,000 as of March 31, 2022 is subject to impairment testing. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment. These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment. We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, or in circumstances where the components share assets or other resources and have other economic interdependencies). We have three reporting units, Duff-Norton, Rest of Products and Precision Conveyance, and have goodwill totaling $9,699,000, $310,793,000, and $328,357,000, respectively, at March 31, 2022. The Precision Conveyance group is new in fiscal 2022 with the acquisitions of Dorner and Garvey (refer to Note 3).
Annual Goodwill Impairment Test
When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy, and changes in key personnel and
overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. We also proceed to the quantitative model when economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test. We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2022 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value. Accordingly, we did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units during fiscal 2022.
We further test our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance of $46,721,000 consisting of trademarks for acquisitions prior to fiscal 2022. Similar to goodwill, we first assess various qualitative factors in the analysis. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2022 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than that its applicable carrying value.
Purchase Price Allocations for Business Combinations. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we completed two business combination for a total purchase price of $548,743,000. Under purchase accounting, we recorded assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition dates. We identified and assigned value to trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, favorable supply agreements, backlog, and technology. We estimated the useful lives over which these intangible assets would be amortized. Valuations of these assets were performed largely using discounted cash flow models and estimates of replacement cost. These valuations support the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets had a preliminary value of $211,350,000. The resulting goodwill was $328,357,000.
Assigning value to intangible assets requires estimates used in projecting relevant future cash flows and estimates of replacement costs, in addition to estimating useful lives of such assets. Further estimates include an attrition rate for customer relationships, royalty rates for technology, trademarks, and patents, and a weighted average cost of capital assumption.
