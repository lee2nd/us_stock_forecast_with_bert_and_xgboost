ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion and analysis generally discuss fiscal year 2022 and 2021 items and fiscal year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.
Business Overview
We are focused on perpetual natural gas and oil mineral ownership in resource plays in the United States. Prior to a strategy change in 2019, we participated with a working interest on some of our mineral and leasehold acreage and as a result, we still have legacy interests in leasehold acreage and non-operated interests in natural gas and oil properties. Effective October 8, 2020, our corporate name was changed to PHX Minerals Inc. to more accurately reflect our business strategy.
Our results of operations are dependent primarily upon the Company’s: existing reserve quantities; costs associated with acquiring, exploring for and developing new reserves; production quantities and related production costs; and natural gas, oil and NGL sales prices. Although a significant amount of our revenues is currently derived from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL on our working interests, the majority of our revenues is derived from royalties granted from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL.
Strategic Focus on Mineral Ownership
During fiscal year 2019, we made the strategic decision to focus on perpetual natural gas and oil mineral ownership and growth through mineral acquisitions and the development of our significant mineral acreage inventory in our core focus areas. In accordance with this decision, we ceased taking working interest positions on our mineral and leasehold acreage going forward. During the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, we did not participate with a working interest in the drilling of any new wells. We believe that our strategy to focus on mineral ownership is the best path to giving our stockholders the greatest risk-weighted returns on their investments.
Market Conditions and Commodity Prices
Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our production volumes or revenues.
Our working interest and royalty revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices, production mix and volumes of production sold by our operators.
Production and Operational Update
Our natural gas production for the fiscal year 2022 increased 11%, while oil and NGL production decreased 12% and 4%, respectively, from that of 2021. The 2022 fiscal year’s higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices (as discussed below) and the overall production changes noted above resulted in an 85% increase in revenues from the sale of natural gas, oil and NGL in 2022.
Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves decreased to 81.1 Bcfe in 2022, compared to 83.0 Bcfe in 2021, a decrease of approximately 1.9 Bcfe, or 2%. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of 17.6 Bcfe proved developed working interest properties in the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas, and the Arkoma Stack play and Western Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, coupled with production and, to a lesser extent, performance revisions. This was partially offset by the acquisition of 15.6 Bcfe, predominately of royalty interest properties in the active drilling programs of the Haynesville Shale play in east Texas and western Louisiana and the Mississippi and Woodford Shale intervals in the SCOOP play in the Ardmore basin of Oklahoma. Additional reserve increases include (i) positive pricing revisions primarily related to natural gas and oil wells extending their economic limits later than was projected in 2021 due to higher commodity prices and other reserve parameters, such as differentials and lease operating costs, and (ii) additions resulting from our royalty interest ownership in the ongoing development of unconventional natural gas, utilizing horizontal drilling,
in the Haynesville Shale play of East Texas and Western Louisiana; and the ongoing development of unconventional natural gas, oil and NGL utilizing horizontal drilling in the Mississippi and Woodford Shale intervals in the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Ardmore and Anadarko basins of Oklahoma.
As of September 30, 2022, we owned an average 0.5% net revenue interest, consisting of all royalty interest, in 172 wells that were being drilled or awaiting completion.
Results of Operations
The following table reflects certain operating data for fiscal 2022 and 2021:
Production by quarter for 2022 and 2021 was as follows (Mcfe):
Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021
Overview
Revenues increased in 2022 primarily due to higher natural gas, oil and NGL sales. We recorded net income of $20,409,272, or $0.59 per share, in 2022, compared to net loss of $6,217,237, or $0.24 per share, in 2021. Expenses increased in 2022, primarily the
result of increases in G&A, production taxes, interest expense and transportation, gathering and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in gains on asset sales and decreases in DD&A, loss on debt extinguishment and LOE.
Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Sales
The increase was due to increased natural gas, oil and NGL prices of 97%, 61% and 52%, respectively, combined with higher natural gas volumes of 11%, partially offset by lower oil and NGL volumes of 12% and 4%, respectively.
The increase in natural gas production was primarily due to acquisitions and new drilling in the Haynesville Shale play of Texas and Louisiana, and slightly offset by divestiture of working interest assets in the Fayetteville Shale and naturally declining production in the Arkoma STACK. The decrease in oil production was a result of naturally declining production in high interest wells in the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays, wells shut in for workovers in the Eagle Ford, our strategy of no longer participating with working interest in new drilling in the Eagle Ford, and the natural decline of wells brought online in fiscal year 2021 in the STACK play. These decreases were partially offset by new drilling and acquisitions in the SCOOP. The decrease in NGL production is primarily attributable to the natural decline in high interest, liquids rich wells in the STACK. This was partially offset by new wells in the SCOOP.
Given our strategic decision to cease participating with working interests, we plan to offset the natural decline of our existing production base by the development of our current inventory of mineral acreage and through acquisitions of additional mineral interests.
Gains (Losses) on Derivative Contracts
(1) Excludes $7,522,794 of cash paid to settle off-market derivative contracts that are not reflected on the Condensed Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. See Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 - “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further explanation on off-market derivative contracts.
The change in net (loss) gain on derivative contracts was due to the settlements of natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps and the change in valuation caused by the difference in September 30, 2022 pricing relative to the strike price on open derivative contracts.
Our natural gas and oil fixed price swaps in place at September 30, 2022, had expiration dates through December 2023. We utilize derivative contracts for the purpose of protecting our cash flow and return on investments.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)
We are responsible for a portion of LOE relating to a well as a working interest owner. LOE includes normal recurring and nonrecurring expenses associated with our working interests necessary to produce hydrocarbons from our natural gas and oil wells, including maintenance, repairs, salt water disposal, insurance and workover expenses. Total LOE related to field operating costs decreased $183,548, or 4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in LOE was principally the result of the divestiture of working interest properties, partially offset by cost inflation associated with field operating activities.
Transportation, Gathering and Marketing
Transportation, gathering and marketing increased $123,103, or 2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase in costs was primarily due to increased production in 2022. The decrease in rate per Mcfe was primarily due to the divestiture of assets with higher associated transportation, gathering and marketing rates and the increase in natural gas sales in fields with lower associated transportation, gathering and marketing rates. Natural gas sales bear the large majority of our transportation, gathering and marketing fees.
Production Taxes
Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at both fixed and variable rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Production taxes increased $1,292,563, or 67%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in amount was primarily the result of increased natural gas, oil and NGL sales of $32,111,587 during 2022.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A is the amount of cost basis of natural gas and oil properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis for working interest, and on a straight-line basis for producing and non-producing minerals. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. DD&A decreased $467,686, or 6%, in 2022 compared to 2021, of which $921,685 of the decrease resulted from a $0.09 decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe, partially offset by an increase of $453,999 resulting from production increasing 6% in 2022. The rate decrease was due to working interest divestitures, partially offset by royalty interest acquisitions in 2022.
Provision for Impairment
Provision for impairment was $14,565 in 2022, as compared to $50,475 provision for impairment in 2021. During 2021, impairment of $37,879 was related to one field. These assets were written down to their fair market value as required by GAAP. The remaining $14,565 and $12,596 of impairment in the 2022 and 2021 periods, respectively, were related to working interest wells in which we assigned our interests to the operator.
Interest Expense
The increase was due to a higher outstanding debt balance and an increase in the average interest rate in 2022 compared to 2021.
General and Administrative Costs (G&A)
G&A are costs not directly associated with the production of natural gas and oil and include the cost of employee salaries and related benefits, office expenses and fees for professional services. G&A for 2022 increased $3,292,712 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to legal expenses associated with reincorporating in the state of Delaware, increased transaction activity and restricted stock expense during the year.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
When we terminated our credit facility led by Bank of Oklahoma in the fourth quarter of 2021, we wrote-off all associated costs that had been previously capitalized.
Losses (Gains) on Asset Sales and Other
The increase in gain on asset sales and other is primarily related to divestitures during 2022.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Provision (benefit) for income taxes changed $4,853,051, from a $651,051 benefit in 2021 to a $4,202,000 provision in 2022. The change in provision (benefit) for income taxes resulted primarily from the change in our net income (loss) from a net loss of $6,217,237 in 2021 to net income of $20,409,272 in 2022.
When a provision for income taxes is expected for the year, federal and Oklahoma excess percentage depletion decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when a benefit for income taxes is recorded.
Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Overview
Revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in losses on derivative contracts, partially offset by higher natural gas, oil and NGL sales. We recorded a net loss of $6,217,237, or $0.24 per share, in 2021, compared to net loss of $23,952,037, or $1.41 per share, in 2020. Expenses decreased in 2021, primarily the result of decreases in provision for impairment (non-cash), DD&A, LOE and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in transportation, gathering and marketing expenses, production taxes and loss on debt extinguishment.
Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Sales
The increase was due to increased natural gas, oil and NGL prices of 82%, 36% and 108%, respectively, combined with higher natural gas and NGL volumes of 12% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by lower oil volumes of 17%.
The increase in natural gas production was primarily due to acquisitions in the Haynesville Shale play of Texas and Louisiana, and slightly offset by naturally declining production in the SCOOP and Arkoma STACK. The decrease in oil production was a result of naturally declining production in high interest wells in the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays, our strategy of no longer participating with working interest in new drilling in the Eagle Ford, and reduced drilling activity in the Bakken. These decreases were slightly offset by acquisitions and new drilling in the STACK. The increase in NGL production is primarily attributable to high interest wells coming back online after being shut-in for part of fiscal year 2020, as well as new wells being brought online in the STACK. This was slightly offset by naturally declining production in the SCOOP.
Given our strategic decision to cease participating with working interests, we plan to offset the natural decline of our existing production base by the development of our current inventory of mineral acreage and through acquisitions of additional mineral interests going forward.
Gains (Losses) on Derivative Contracts
The change in net loss on derivative contracts was due to the natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps being less beneficial in 2021 in relation to their respective contracted volumes and prices. The change from a net liability position of $707,647 at September 30, 2020, to a net liability position of $13,784,467 at September 30, 2021, resulted from non-cash loss on derivative contracts in the 2021 period of $4,276,820 and entry into off-market hedges with BP Energy Company (“BP”) for $8.8 million in cash. See Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 - “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further explanation.
Our natural gas and oil fixed price swaps in place at September 30, 2021, had expiration dates through March 2023. We utilize derivative contracts for the purpose of protecting our cash flow and return on investments.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)
We are responsible for a portion of LOE relating to a well as a working interest owner. LOE includes normal recurring and nonrecurring expenses associated with our working interests necessary to produce hydrocarbons from our natural gas and oil wells, including maintenance, repairs, salt water disposal, insurance and workover expenses. Total LOE related to field operating costs decreased $610,573, or 13%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in LOE rate was principally the result of our strategic decision to cease participating with a working interest in new wells and the increase in royalty interest production as a percentage of total production.
Transportation, Gathering and Marketing
Transportation, gathering and marketing increased $954,418, or 20%, in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase in costs was primarily due to increased production in 2021. The increase in rate per Mcfe was primarily due to the increase in natural gas sales in relation to other products. Natural gas sales bear the large majority of our transportation, gathering and marketing fees.
Production Taxes
Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at both fixed and variable rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Production taxes increased $915,392, or 89%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in amount was primarily the result of increased natural gas, oil and NGL sales of $14,379,041 during 2021.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A is the amount of cost basis of natural gas and oil properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis for working interest, and on a straight-line basis for producing and non-producing minerals. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. DD&A decreased $3,567,979, or 32%, in 2021 compared to 2020, of which $4,204,702 of the decrease resulted from a $0.47 decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe, partially offset by an increase of $636,723 resulting from production increasing 6% in 2021. The rate decrease was partially due to higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices utilized in the reserve calculations during the 2021 period, as compared to 2020 period, lengthening the economic life of wells. This resulted in higher projected remaining reserves on a significant number of wells causing decreased units of production DD&A, despite the increase in projection.
Provision for Impairment
Provision for impairment was $50,475 in 2021, as compared to $29,904,528 provision for impairment in 2020. During 2021, impairment of $37,879 was related to one field. These assets were written down to their fair market value as required by GAAP. During 2020, impairment of $29,315,806 was recorded on seven different fields including the Fayetteville and Eagle Ford shales, which represented 89% of our total impairment. The impairment in these seven fields was caused by lower future prices reducing future net cash flows associated with these fields, which caused these assets to fail the step one test for impairment as their undiscounted cash flows were not high enough to cover the book basis of the assets. These assets were written down to their fair market value as required by GAAP. The remaining $12,596 and $588,721 of impairment in the 2021 and 2020 periods, respectively, were recorded on other assets.
Interest Expense
The decrease was due to a lower outstanding debt balance in 2021 compared to 2020.
General and Administrative Costs (G&A)
G&A are costs not directly associated with the production of natural gas and oil and include the cost of employee salaries and related benefits, office expenses and fees for professional services. G&A for 2021 increased $182,981 as compared to 2020. The slight increase was primarily due to increased activity during the year, partially offset by our cost reduction efforts.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
When we terminated our credit facility led by Bank of Oklahoma, we wrote-off all associated costs that had been previously capitalized.
Loss (Gain) on Asset Sales and Other
In 2021, we recorded a net gain on asset sales of $312,838 as compared to a net gain of $3,973,256 in 2020. During 2021, we sold 2,857 net mineral acres in Central Basin Platform in Texas for $285,714, resulting in a gain of $236,907. The remaining gain on asset sales in 2021 was due to various immaterial asset sales less adjustments.
During the first quarter of 2020, we sold producing mineral acreage in Eddy County, New Mexico, for a gain of $3,272,499. We utilized a like-kind exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 to defer income tax on all of the gain by offsetting it with the STACK/SCOOP mineral acreage acquisition that was purchased during the quarter using qualified exchange accommodation agreements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we sold 5,925 non-producing mineral acres in northwestern Oklahoma for a gain of $717,640. The remaining gain on asset sales in 2020 was due to various asset sales less adjustments.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Provision (benefit) for income taxes changed $7,637,949, from a $8,289,000 benefit in 2020 to a $651,051 benefit in 2021. The income tax benefit change resulted primarily from the reduction in net loss.
When a provision for income taxes is expected for the year, federal and Oklahoma excess percentage depletion decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when a benefit for income taxes is recorded.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We had positive working capital (current assets less current liabilities excluding current derivatives) of $14,533,225 at September 30, 2022, compared to positive working capital of $9,175,126 at September 30, 2021.
Liquidity
Cash and cash equivalents were $3,396,809 as of September 30, 2022, compared to $2,438,511 at September 30, 2021, an increase of $958,298. Cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, are summarized as follows:
Operating activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $33,589,563 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of the following:
•Receipts of natural gas, oil and NGL sales (net of production taxes and gathering, transportation and marketing costs) and other increased $27,620,895;
•Decreased net payments on derivative contracts of $9,129,420;
•Increased lease bonus receipts of $246,554; and
•Decreased payments for interest expense of $24,057.
Offset by:
•Increased income tax payments of $1,775,474;
•Increased payments for G&A and other expense of $1,650,019; and
•Increased field operating expenses of $5,870.
Investing activities:
Net cash used in investing activities increased $10,491,111 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of the following:
•Higher acquisition activity increased our expenditures by $22,900,889.
Offset by:
•Higher proceeds received from the sale of assets of $12,229,244; and
•Lower workover activity during 2022 decreased our capital expenditures by $180,534.
Financing activities:
Net cash used in financing activities increased $13,888,270 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of the following:
•Increased net cash payments on off-market derivative contracts of $28,060,104 during 2022;
•Increased dividend payments by $1,197,453 during 2022; and
•Decreased net proceeds from equity issuance of $6,681,599 during 2022.
Offset by:
•Increased net borrowings on debt of $22,050,000.
Capital Resources
We had no capital expenditures to drill and complete wells in 2022, as a result of our strategy to cease participating in new wells with a working interest at the end of fiscal year 2019. We currently have no remaining commitments that would require significant capital to drill and complete wells.
Since we have decided to cease further participation in wells with a working interest on our mineral and leasehold acreage, we expect that capital expenditures for working interest properties will be minimal going forward, as the expenditures will be limited to capital workovers to enhance existing wells.
Over the past five quarters, we made the following property acquisitions:
We received lease bonus payments during fiscal year 2022 totaling approximately $0.7 million. Looking forward, the cash flow from bonus payments associated with the leasing of drilling rights on our mineral acreage is difficult to project and management plans to continue to actively pursue leasing opportunities.
With continued natural gas and oil price volatility, management continues to evaluate opportunities for product price protection through additional hedging of our future natural gas and oil production. See Note 12 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a complete list of our outstanding derivative contracts.
The use of cash provided by operating activities and resultant change to cash is summarized in the table below:
Outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2022 were $28,300,000.
Looking forward, we expect to fund overhead costs, mineral and royalty acquisitions, and dividend payments from cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and borrowings from our Credit Facility. We had availability of $21,700,000 at September 30, 2022 under our Credit Facility and were in compliance with our debt covenants (current ratio, debt to trailing 12-month EBITDAX, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and restricted payments limited by leverage ratio). The debt covenants in the Credit Agreement limit the maximum ratio of our debt to EBITDAX to no more than 3.5:1.
We have our Credit Facility with certain lenders and Independent Bank, as Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Issuer, which provides for up to $100 million in borrowings from time to time and is subject to an at least semi-annual borrowing base determination. The borrowing base at September 30, 2022, was $50,000,000 and all obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our personal property and at least 80% of the total value of our proved, developed and producing Oil and Gas Properties. The revolving loan matures on September 1, 2025. Borrowings under the revolving loan are due at maturity. Interest on the Credit Agreement is calculated based on either (a) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.750% to 3.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day, or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the US Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (0.50%), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 1.750% to 2.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, a 5% interest penalty may apply to any outstanding amount not paid when due or that remains outstanding while an event of default exists. At September 30, 2022, the effective rate was 5.93%. The Credit Agreement contains financial and various other covenants that are common in such agreements, including a (a) maximum ratio of consolidated Funded Indebtedness to consolidated pro forma EBITDAX of 3.50 to 1.00, calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis, and (b) minimum ratio of consolidated Current Assets to consolidated Current Liabilities (excluding the Loan Balance) of 1.00 to 1.00. Other negative covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if both before and after the Restricted Payment (i) the Available Commitment is less than or equal to ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is greater than 2.50 to 1.00. All capitalized terms in this description of the Credit Facility that are not otherwise defined in this Annual Report have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
Based on our expected capital expenditure levels, anticipated cash provided by operating activities for 2023, combined with availability under our Credit Facility and potential future sales of Common Stock under our currently effective shelf registration statement, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing operations.
On August 25, 2021, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, as sales agent and/or principal (“Stifel”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through or to Stifel, up to 3,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. As of September 30, 2022, we have sold 1,531,013 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement for proceeds of approximately $5.9 million, net of commissions paid. As disclosed in Item 9B - Other Information of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we voluntarily terminated the ATM Agreement on December 12, 2022.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
We have our Credit Facility with certain lenders and Independent Bank, as Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Issuer, which provides for up to $100 million in borrowings from time to time and is subject to an at least semi-annual borrowing base determination. The borrowing base at September 30, 2022, was $50,000,000 and all obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our personal property and at least 80% of the total value of our proved, developed and producing Oil and Gas Properties. The revolving loan matures on September 1, 2025. Borrowings under the revolving loan are due at maturity. Interest on the Credit Agreement is calculated based on either (a) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.750% to 3.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day, or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the US Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (0.50%), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 1.750% to 2.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, a 5% interest penalty may apply to any outstanding amount not paid when due or that remains outstanding while an event of default exists. At September 30, 2022, the effective rate was 5.93%. All capitalized terms in this description of the Credit Facility that are not otherwise defined in this Annual Report have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
Determinations of the borrowing base are made at least semi-annually (on December 1 and June 1) or whenever the banks, in their discretion, believe that there has been a material change in the value of the natural gas and oil properties. The Credit Agreement contains financial and various other covenants that are common in such agreements, including a (a) maximum ratio of consolidated Funded Indebtedness to consolidated pro forma EBITDAX of 3.50 to 1.00, calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis, and (b) minimum ratio of consolidated Current Assets to consolidated Current Liabilities (excluding the Loan Balance) of 1.00 to 1.00. Other negative covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if before or after the Restricted Payment (i) the Available Commitment is less than or equal to ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is greater than 2.50 to 1.00. At September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility, had $28,300,000 outstanding and had $21,700,000 of borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility.
The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2022:
Our building leases are accounted for as operating leases, and a related operating lease right-of-use (”ROU”) asset and operating lease liability has been recognized on our balance sheets.
At September 30, 2022, our derivative contracts were in a net liability position of $8,561,191. The ultimate settlement amounts of the derivative contracts are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. Please read
