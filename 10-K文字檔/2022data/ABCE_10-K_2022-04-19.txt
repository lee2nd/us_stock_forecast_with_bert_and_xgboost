OVERVIEW
As of December 31, 2021, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company’s plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. This will result in larger contracting jobs, statewide expansion and growth in revenue. We remain committed to high quality operations.
Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses. Footnotes to the financial statements discloses the related party transactions of Officer, Directors and other related parties.
FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021, COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020
Sales increased to $1,372,410 in 2021, an increase of $211,304 or 18% over 2020 sales of $1,161,106. The Covid 19 Pandemic, Lack of funds and available staff has reduced our ability to maintain our sales momentum. Our experience has shown us that there is going to be such pressure on our market, and we are changing to prevent the decreases in sales in the future. We have added new products and new sales personnel and intend to find merger and acquisition funding and acquisition or merger candidates during the current year. There is no assurance that ABCO will be able to accomplish these goals in the coming year.
Cost of sales increased by $164,161, or 21% to $948,891 in 2021 from $784,730 in 2020 due primarily to the increase in sales. The Company also changed its focus from residential installs to a commercial focus in order to meet changes in the market. Gross margin as a percentage of total sales was at 31% in 2021 from 32% in 2020, primarily due to higher margins associated with commercial jobs and better management of costs on the larger commercial jobs in 2019. We hope to bid these contracts more favorably in the future to prevent negative cost of sales numbers. We hope that more efficient production and a sales mix shift to the higher profit commercial market emphasis will improve these numbers.
General and administrative expenses increased by $246,78 to $1,093,425 in 2021 from $846,640 in 2020 due primarily to increases in stock based compensation to management which accounted for more than the total increase for the period. We also decreased our administration staff since 2020 in order to control operating expenses and to closely administering public company expenses.
Net loss from operations increased by $199,642 to $(669,906) for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to a loss from operations of $(470,264) for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is attributable to expenses from stockbased compensation and financing. We had similar margins in 2021 as in 2020 due to the emphasis on commercial projects.
Total Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was $(668,375) and $(524,759) for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is attributable to expenses from stock based compensation, financing and professional fee charges in 2021 that did not occur in 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for carrying cost of accounts receivable and inventory during and after completion of contracts. This process can easily exceed 90 days and requires the contractor to pay all or most of the cost of the project without assistance from suppliers. Our working capital on December 31, 2021, was $(1,390,788) and it was $(1,507,716) on December 31, 2020. This decrease of $129,720 was primarily funded by our officer’s loans and private equity offerings.
ABCO Energy has increased its loan obligations or long-term debt in 2021. Our long-term debt net of current portion totaled $495,525 on December 31, 2021, and $472,293 on December 31, 2020, due mainly to the SBA loans and equipment purchase loans obtained by the Company.
On December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company owed Officers and Directors $533,244 and $311,340 respectively on demand notes. This is an increase of$221,904 which represents an additional loan from the President of ABCO
Bank financing has not been available to the Company.
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2019 our net cash used in operating activities was $(612,849) and $(66,859) respectively. Net cash used by operating activities in the period ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 consisted primarily of net loss from operations adjusted for non-cash expenses, stock based compensation expense and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 was $667 and $(47,094) respectively. This is primarily due to the purchase of autos for operations and investment in our building improvements. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 was $563,844 and $55,601 respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2021 and 2020 resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock and officer’s loans.
Since our inception on August 8, 2008, through December 31, 2021, we have incurred net losses of $(7,754,642), including the effects of derivatives on convertible debt totaling $2,136,674 and stock based compensation of $562,699 over the last few years. Our cash and cash equivalent balances were $31,414 and $54,268 as of December 31, 2021, and 2020 respectively. On December 31, 2021, we had total liabilities of $2,249,620 as opposed to $2,398,499 on December 31, 2020, an decrease of $148,879. Most of the increase occurred because of the SBA long term loan, officer’s loans and the auto purchases.
We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements, primarily the working capital required for the marketing of our products and services, by additional financing and more operations income. This will likely be in the form of future debt or equity financing. Based on our current operating plan, we have sufficient working capital to sustain operations for the short term if we do not expand our business. We will not however, be able to reach our goals and projections for multistate expansion without a cash infusion. We expect that our revenue will increase at a steady pace and that this volume of business will result in profitable operations in the future.
OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS
The Company has no off-balance sheet transactions during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020.
