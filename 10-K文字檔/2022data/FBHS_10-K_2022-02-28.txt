Overview
The Company is a leader in home and security products focused on the design, manufacture and sale of market-leading branded products in the following categories: plumbing and accessories, entry door and storm door systems, security products, outdoor performance materials used in decking and railing products, and kitchen and bath cabinetry.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net sales based on country of destination were:
We believe the Company has certain competitive advantages including market-leading brands, a diversified mix of customer channels, lean and flexible supply chains, a decentralized business model and a strong capital structure, as well as a tradition of strong innovation and customer service. We are focused on outperforming our markets in growth, profitability and returns in order to drive increased stockholder value. We believe the Company’s track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. As consumer demand and the housing market continue to grow, we expect the benefits of operating leverage and strategic spending to support increased manufacturing capacity and long-term growth initiatives will help us to continue to achieve profitable organic growth.
We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions, non-controlling equity investments, and joint ventures, and return cash to stockholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program as explained in further detail under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
The U.S. market for our home products consists of spending on both new home construction and repair and remodel activities within existing homes, with the substantial majority of the markets we serve consisting of repair and remodel spending. Continued growth in the U.S. market for our home products will largely depend on consumer confidence, employment, wage growth, home prices, stable mortgage rates and credit availability.
We may be impacted by fluctuations in raw materials, component costs, labor costs, tariffs, transportation costs, foreign exchange rates, inflation, interest rates and promotional activity among our competitors, among other things. We strive to offset the potential unfavorable impact of these items with productivity improvements and price increases.
During the two years ended December 31, 2021, our net sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 15.2% as we benefited from a growing U.S. home products market, acquisitions, and growth in international markets. Operating income grew at a compounded annual rate of 24.9% with consolidated operating margins between 12% and 14% from 2019 to 2021. Growth in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume, changes to our portfolio of businesses, control over our operating expenses and the benefits of manufacturing productivity programs.
During the first half of 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of countries and U.S. states issued orders requiring nonessential businesses to close (“closure orders”) and persons who were not engaged in essential businesses to stay at home. Generally, states and jurisdictions designated our products, our retail channel partners and residential construction as essential business activities. While our financial results were negatively impacted during the second quarter of 2020 by these closure orders, sales volumes increased as these restrictions were relaxed benefiting our third and fourth quarter 2020 results.
During 2021, the U.S. home products market grew due to increases in repair and remodel and new home construction activity. We believe spending for home repair and remodeling increased approximately 14% and new housing construction experienced approximately 11% growth in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, net sales grew 25.7% due to higher sales volume including the favorable comparison to 2020 when our volumes were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit from the Larson acquisition ($403.4 million), price increases to help mitigate the impact of cumulative commodity and transportation cost increases and favorable mix, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $63 million. These benefits were partially offset by higher promotion and volume-based rebate costs. In 2021, operating income increased 36.1% over 2020 primarily due to higher net sales, the benefit from the Larson acquisition, manufacturing productivity improvements, the absence of the 2020 asset impairment charges and lower restructuring and other charges, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $17 million. These benefits were partially offset by higher commodity, employee-related and transportation costs, higher amortization of intangible assets principally due to the Larson acquisition, higher advertising costs, higher promotion and volume-based rebate costs and higher tariffs.
In December 2020, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Larson, the North American market leading brand of storm, screen and security doors, for a total purchase price of approximately $717.5 million, net of cash acquired. We financed the transaction with borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The results of operations are included in the Outdoors & Security segment. The financial results of Larson were included in the Company’s December 31, 2021 and 2020 consolidated balance sheets and the Company's consolidated statements of income and of cash flows beginning January 2021. Larson's net sales, operating income and cash flows from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2020 were not material to the Company.
In June 2020, we repaid all amounts outstanding on the 3.000% Senior Notes issued in June 2015 at their maturity date using borrowings under our 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below). In September 2019, the Company issued $700 million of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2029 (“2019 Notes”) in a registered public offering. The Company used the proceeds from the 2019 Notes offering to repay in full a $350 million term loan and to pay down outstanding balances under our 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement.
In November 2021, the Company entered into a 364-day, $400 million term loan credit agreement (“2021 Term Loan”) for general corporate purposes that matures in November 2022. Interest rates under the 2021 Term Loan are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.625% to LIBOR + 1.25%.
In 2018 our Plumbing segment entered into a strategic partnership with, and acquired non-controlling equity interests in, Flo Technologies, Inc. (“Flo”), a U.S. manufacturer of comprehensive water monitoring and shut-off systems with leak detection technologies. In January 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Flo in a multi-phase transaction, which was completed in January 2022. The minority shareholders' substantive participating rights expired on January 1, 2021, at which time we obtained control of, and began consolidating, Flo in our results of operations and statements of financial positions and cash flows. Immediately prior to consolidating Flo, we recognized a non-cash loss of $4.5 million within other expense for the year-ended December 31, 2021, related to the remeasurement of our previously existing investment in Flo. During the fourth quarter of 2021 we recorded a mark-to-market expense of $2.2 million related to the remaining shares held by the minority shareholders.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been derived from the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending December 31. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending during the month of December.
Results of Operations
The following discussion of both consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations refers to the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The discussion of consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of segment results of operations and our financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of results of operations are for continuing operations.
Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Certain items had a significant impact on our results in 2021 and 2020. These included restructuring and other charges, asset impairment charges and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
In 2021, financial results included:
•the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to movement in the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, British pound and Chinese yuan, which had a favorable impact compared to 2020, of approximately $63 million on net sales and of approximately $17 million both on operating income and net income and
•restructuring and other charges of $20.7 million before tax ($15.9 million after tax), largely related to severance costs associated with the relocation of manufacturing facilities within our Outdoor & Security and Cabinets segments.
In 2020, financial results included:
•restructuring and other charges of $25.1 million before tax ($17.5 million after tax), largely related to headcount actions associated with COVID-19 across all segments and costs associated with changes in our manufacturing processes within our Plumbing segment,
•asset impairment charges of $22.5 million related to the impairment of indefinite-lived tradenames within our Plumbing and Cabinets segments, which were primarily the result of forecasted sales declines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,
•actuarial losses within our defined benefit plans of $3.4 million primarily related to decreases in discount rates and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets and
•the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to movement in the Canadian dollar, British pound, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan, which had an unfavorable impact compared to 2019, of approximately $4 million on net sales and a favorable impact compared to 2019, of approximately $1 million both on operating income and net income.
Total Fortune Brands
Net sales
Net sales increased by $1,565.8 million, or 25.7%, due to higher sales volume including the favorable comparison to 2020 when our volumes were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit from the Larson acquisition ($403.4 million), price increases to help mitigate the impact of cumulative commodity and transportation cost increases and favorable mix, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $63 million. These benefits were partially offset by higher promotion and volume-based rebate costs.
Cost of products sold
Cost of products sold increased by $983.2 million, or 25.0%, due to higher net sales, the impact of the Larson acquisition including higher amortization of the acquisition related inventory fair value adjustment ($3.3 million in 2021), commodity cost inflation, product mix, labor inflation, and higher tariffs, partially offset by the benefit from manufacturing productivity improvements.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $296.4 million, or 23.1%, due to higher transportation and employee-related costs, the impact of the Larson acquisition and advertising costs.
Amortization of intangible assets
Amortization of intangible assets increased by $22.1 million primarily due to the Larson acquisition in our Outdoors & Security segment ($18.2 million) and the 2021 consolidation of Flo in our Plumbing segment ($2.6 million).
Asset impairment charges
Asset impairment charges of $22.5 million in 2020 related to indefinite-lived tradenames within our Plumbing and Cabinets segments.
Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges of $13.5 million in 2021 largely related to severance costs associated with the relocation of manufacturing facilities within our Outdoor & Security and Cabinets segments. Restructuring charges of $15.9 million in 2020 largely related to headcount actions associated with COVID-19 across all segments and costs associated with changes in our manufacturing processes within our Plumbing segment.
Operating income
Operating income increased by $289.0 million, or 36.1%, primarily due to higher net sales, the benefit from the Larson acquisition, manufacturing productivity improvements, the absence of the 2020 asset impairment charges and lower restructuring and other charges, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $17 million. These benefits were partially offset by higher commodity, employee-related and transportation costs, higher amortization of intangible assets principally due to the Larson acquisition, higher advertising costs, higher promotion and volume-based rebate costs and higher tariffs.
Interest expense
Interest expense increased by $0.5 million to $84.4 million, due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates.
Other expense (income), net
Other expense (income), net, was expense of $0.9 million in 2021, compared to income of $13.3 million in 2020. The decrease of $14.2 million of income is primarily due to losses of $5.0 million in 2021 and gains of $11.0 million in 2020 related to our investment in Flo prior to its consolidation and unfavorable foreign currency losses, partially offset by higher defined benefit income ($7.8 million increase).
Income taxes
The effective income tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 23.2% and 23.1%, respectively. The 2021 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by state and local income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher rates and a valuation allowance increase. This expense was offset by favorable benefits for the release of uncertain tax positions, primarily related to statute of limitation lapses, and share-based compensation.
The 2020 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by state and local income taxes and foreign income taxed at higher rates. This expense was offset by a tax benefit related to share-based compensation.
Net income attributable to Fortune Brands
Net income attributable to Fortune Brands was $772.4 million in 2021 compared to $553.1 million in 2020. The increase of $219.3 million was due to higher operating income, lower equity in losses of affiliate and lower noncontrolling interests, partly offset by higher income tax expenses, higher other expense and higher interest expense.
Results By Segment
Plumbing
Net sales increased by $559.1 million, or 25.4%, due to higher sales volume across all brands and markets, including showroom customers whose locations were negatively impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, and price increases to help mitigate the impact of cumulative commodity and transportation cost increases, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $53 million. These benefits were partially offset by higher volume-based rebate costs.
Operating income increased by $161.8 million, or 34.6%, due to higher net sales, the benefit from manufacturing productivity improvements, the absence of the 2020 asset impairment charge ($13.0 million) and favorable restructuring and other charges, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $21 million. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of higher employee-related, freight, commodity, advertising and tariff costs, higher amortization of intangible assets related to the Flo acquisition and higher volume-based rebate costs.
Outdoors & Security
Net sales increased by $620.7 million, or 43.7%, due to the benefit from the Larson acquisition ($403.4 million), higher sales volume including the favorable comparison to 2020 when our volumes were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, price increases to help mitigate the impact of cumulative commodity and transportation cost increases and lower rebate costs due to timing of sales in 2021 versus prior year period, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1 million. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix primarily driven by materials availability.
Operating income increased by $90.6 million, or 45.0%, due to higher net sales, the benefit from the Larson acquisition and manufacturing productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by commodity cost inflation, higher freight and employee-related costs and higher restructuring charges, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $1 million.
Cabinets
Net sales increased by $386.0 million, or 15.6%, due to higher sales volume in both our stock and make-to-order products, including the favorable comparison to 2020 when our volumes were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, price increases to help mitigate the impact of cumulative commodity and transportation cost increases and favorable mix, as well as favorable foreign exchange of approximately $8 million. These benefits were partially offset by higher volume-based rebate costs.
Operating income increased by $43.6 million, or 18.5%, due to higher net sales, the benefit from manufacturing productivity improvements, the absence of the 2020 asset impairment charge ($9.5 million) and lower advertising, tariff and restructuring costs. These factors were partly offset by higher freight, commodity, and employee-related costs and higher volume-based rebate costs, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $3 million.
Corporate
Corporate expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 6.8%, due to higher employee-related and consulting costs. These factors were partly offset by the absence of transaction costs associated with the Larson acquisition in 2020 ($4.5 million) and the absence of the impairment of a long-lived asset in 2020 ($3.6 million).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, cash borrowed under our credit facility and cash from debt issuances in the capital markets. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. We believe our operating cash flows, including funds available under the credit facility and access to capital markets, provide sufficient liquidity to support the Company’s working capital requirements, capital expenditures and service of indebtedness, as well as to finance acquisitions,
repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends to stockholders, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” In addition, we cannot predict whether or when we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or dispositions, make any purchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, or pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise.
Unsecured Senior Notes
At December 31, 2021, the Company had aggregate outstanding notes in the principal amount of $1.8 billion, with varying maturities (the “Notes”). The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s outstanding Notes, including the carrying value of the Notes, net of underwriting commissions, price discounts and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:
Credit Facilities
In November 2021, the Company entered into a 364-day, $400 million term loan credit agreement (“2021 Term Loan”) for general corporate purposes that matures in November 2022. Interest rates under the 2021 Term Loan are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.625% to LIBOR + 1.25%. Covenants under the 2021 Term Loan are the same as the existing $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility.
In September 2019, the Company entered into a second amended and restated $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the “2019 Revolving Credit Agreement”), and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes. The maturity date of the facility is September 2024. Interest rates under the 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating, and can range from LIBOR + 0.91% to LIBOR + 1.4%. Company is required to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, losses from asset impairments, and certain other one-time adjustments. In addition, the Company’s ratio of consolidated debt minus certain cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA generally may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. On December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our outstanding borrowings under this credit facility were $520.0 million and 785.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under this credit facility.
We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China, which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $17.5 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, of which there were no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The weighted-average interest rates on these borrowings were zero in 2021 and 2020.
Commercial Paper
In November 2021, the Company established a commercial paper program (the "Commercial Paper Program") pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time not to exceed $1.25 billion. The Company’s 2019
Revolving Credit Agreement is the liquidity backstop for the repayment of any notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program. The Company plans to use net proceeds from any issuances under the Commercial Paper Program for general corporate purposes. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, the components of external long-term debt were as follows:
In our debt agreements, there are normal and customary events of default which would permit the lenders to accelerate the debt if not cured within applicable grace periods, such as failure to pay principal or interest when due or a change in control of the Company. There were no events of default as of December 31, 2021.
Cash and Seasonality
In 2021, we invested approximately $148.1 million in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential and new products inclusive of cost reduction and productivity initiatives. We expect capital spending in 2022 to be in the range of $375 to $425 million, reflecting incremental capacity investments in our decking product line within Outdoors & Security. On December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $471.5 million, of which $376.1 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay and record tax expense on those funds that are repatriated.
Our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our business. We typically generate most of our operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of each year. We use operating cash in the first quarter of the year.
Share Repurchases
In 2021, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program for $447.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization under the remaining program was approximately $414.7 million. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Dividends
In 2021, we paid dividends in the amount of $143.0 million to the Company’s stockholders. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance as to when and if future dividends will be paid, and at what level, because the payment of dividends is dependent on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands.
Acquisitions
We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate potential strategic transactions and other capital initiatives to increase stockholder value. In December 2020, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Larson for a total purchase price of approximately $717.5 million, net of cash acquired.
In 2018 our Plumbing segment entered into a strategic partnership with, and acquired non-controlling equity interests in, Flo Technologies, Inc. (“Flo”), a U.S. manufacturer of comprehensive water monitoring and shut-off systems with leak detection technologies. In January 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Flo in a multi-phase transaction, which was completed in January 2022. The minority shareholders' substantive participating rights expired on January 1, 2021, at which time we obtained control of, and began consolidating, Flo in our results of operations and statements of financial positions and cash flows. Immediately prior to consolidating Flo, we recognized a non-cash loss of $4.5 million within other expense for the year-ended December 31, 2021, related to the remeasurement of our previously existing investment in Flo. During the fourth quarter of 2021 we recorded a mark-to-market expense of $2.2 million related to the remaining shares held by the minority shareholders.
Cash Flows
Below is a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $688.7 million in 2021 compared to $825.7 million in 2020. The $137.0 million decrease in cash provided from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to an increase in our inventory investments to mitigate the impact of an uncertain and volatile global supply chain environment and higher increases in accounts receivable associated with our sales growth. These factors were partially offset by higher net income.
Net cash used in investing activities was $207.1 million in 2021 compared to $923.5 million in 2020. The decrease in cash used of $716.4 million from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of Larson in December 2020 ($713.0 million decrease), the acquisition of additional shares of Flo in January and April 2020 ($59.4 million decrease) and the cash acquired during the consolidation of Flo in January 2021, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities was $428.6 million in 2021 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $111.6 million in 2020. The increase in cash used of $540.2 million from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to higher share repurchases in 2021 compared to 2020 ($260.1 million increase), lower net borrowings in 2021 compared to 2020 ($250.0 million decrease), lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options and higher dividends to shareholders ($9.7 million increase).
Pension Plans
Subsidiaries of Fortune Brands sponsor their respective defined benefit pension plans that are funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within our benefit plan trust. In 2021 and 2020, we contributed $21.3 million and $47.7 million, respectively, to our qualified pension plans. In 2022, we expect to make pension contributions of approximately $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of our total pension plan assets was $816.0 million, representing funding of 92% of the accumulated benefit obligation liability. For the foreseeable future, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding that may be required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.
Foreign Exchange
We have operations in various foreign countries, principally Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, South Africa, France and Japan. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments
The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021. Purchase obligations were $959.1 million, of which $900.3 million is due within one year. Purchase obligations include contracts for raw materials and finished goods purchases, selling and administrative services, and capital expenditures. Total lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2021 were $48.2 million in 2022, $43.3 million in 2023, $34.0 million in 2024, $24.6 million in 2025, $20.4 million in 2026 and $55.2 million thereafter. A final payment of $16.6 million related to our acquisition of Flo was paid in January 2022.
Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $83.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 have been excluded from the paragraph above.
In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments described above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2021. Other corporate commercial commitments include standby letters of credit of $37.0 million, in the aggregate, all of which expire in less than one year, and surety bonds of $22.7 million, of which $17.4 million matures in less than one year and $5.3 million matures in 1-3 years. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity.
Debt payments due during the next five years as of December 31, 2021 are $400 million in 2022, $600 million in 2023, $520 million in 2024, $500 million in 2025, zero in 2026 and $700 million in 2027 and beyond. The Company intends to repay or refinance the $400 million Term Loan on or before the November 2022 maturity date. Interest payments due during the next five years as of December 31, 2021 are $78 million in 2022, $124 million in 2023 through 2024, $56 million in 2025 through 2026 and $68 million in 2027 and beyond.
Foreign Currency Risk
Certain anticipated transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. We regularly monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. For additional information on this risk, see
