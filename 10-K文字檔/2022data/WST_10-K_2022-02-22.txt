ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
The following discussion is intended to further the reader’s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our Company. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures
For the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than USD at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. We may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. The unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.
Our Operations
We are a leading global manufacturer in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Our products include a variety of primary packaging, containment solutions, reconstitution and transfer systems, and drug delivery systems, as well as contract manufacturing, analytical lab services and integrated solutions. Our customers include the leading biologic, generic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and additional medical device companies in the world. Our top priority is delivering quality products that meet the exact product specifications and quality standards customers require and expect. This focus on quality includes a commitment to excellence in manufacturing, scientific and technical expertise and management, which enables us to partner with our customers in order to deliver safe, effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently.
Our business operations are organized into two reportable segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Our Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment and drug delivery products, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. We also maintain collaborations to share technologies and market products with affiliates in Japan and Mexico.
Impact of COVID-19
It has been nearly two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began and there remains uncertainty around the long-term impact of the pandemic on the world economy. Our primary objectives have remained the same throughout the pandemic: to support the safety of our team members and their families and continue to support patients around the world. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our production facilities have continued to operate as they had prior to the pandemic, other than for enhanced safety measures intended to prevent the spread of the virus and higher levels of production at certain plant locations to meet additional customer demand. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong. The remote working arrangements and travel restrictions imposed by various governments have had limited impact on our ability to maintain operations, as our manufacturing operations have generally been exempted from stay-at-home orders. However, we cannot predict the impact of the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic on future results due to a variety of factors, including the continued good health of our employees, the ability of suppliers to continue to operate and deliver, the ability of West and its customers to maintain operations, continued access to transportation resources, the changing needs and priorities of customers, any further government and/or public actions taken in response to the pandemic and ultimately the length of the pandemic. We will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ensure the safety of our people and our ability to serve our customers and patients worldwide.
Components of and Key Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. We believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures.
Net Sales
Our net sales results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Several factors affect our reported net sales in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions, competition, and business acquisitions that involve our customers or competitors.
Cost of goods and services sold and gross profit
Cost of goods and services sold includes personnel costs, manufacturing costs, raw materials and product costs, freight costs, depreciation, and facility costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Fluctuations in our cost of goods sold correspond with the fluctuations in sales units as well as inflationary and other market factors that influence our cost base.
Gross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold. Our gross profit is affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the costs of materials used to make our products.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses relate to our investments in improvements to our manufacturing processes, product enhancements, and additional investments in our self-injection systems development, fluid transfer admixture devices, elastomeric packaging components, and formulation development.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period primarily based on the ongoing improvements to our manufacturing processes and product enhancements.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs, incentive compensation, insurance, professional fees, and depreciation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We evaluate the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that we consider not representative of ongoing operations. Such items are referred to as other unallocated items for which further information can be found above in the reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by $8.5 million, or 95.5%, in 2020, primarily due to favorable operating results at Daikyo and the increased ownership of Daikyo starting in the fourth quarter of 2019.
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
The following table presents cash flow data for the years ended December 31:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
2021 compared to 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $111.5 million in 2021, primarily due to improved operating results, offset by increases in working capital and timing of tax payments in 2021.
2020 compared to 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $105.3 million in 2020, primarily due to improved operating results and changes in assets and liabilities.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
2021 compared to 2020
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $73.6 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in 2021 to meet customer demand.
2020 compared to 2019
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $48.5 million in 2020, primarily due to 2019 investing activities that did not recur in 2020, such as our increase in Daikyo ownership and the acquisition of our South Korea distributor in 2019. These reductions in investing activities were offset in 2020 by an increase in capital expenditures to support our increased customer demands.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
2021 compared to 2020
Net cash used in financing activities increased by $31.0 million in 2021, primarily due to an increase in purchases under our share repurchases program.
2020 compared to 2019
Net cash used in financing activities increased by $100.3 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in purchases under our share repurchases program and given 2019 included new long-term borrowings while no such new borrowings occurred in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of:
Cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents - Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2021 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. The cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2021 included $422.0 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the U.S. and $340.6 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S. In response to the 2017 Tax Act, we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 (with the exception of China and Mexico) and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested. As of January 1, 2018, we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post-2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries. In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis, and that position has not changed subsequent to the one-time transition tax under the 2017 Tax Act, except as noted above. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately $635.3 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S., as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested. Further, it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion, because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws, exchange rates, circumstances existing when there is a repatriation, sale or liquidation, or other factors.
Working capital - Working capital at December 31, 2021 increased by $277.6 million, or 31.9%, as compared to December 31, 2020, which includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $13.3 million. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, and total current liabilities increased by $162.6 million, $121.0 million, $69.3 million, and $108.0 million, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity. The increase in inventories that occurred in the period was to ensure we have sufficient inventory on hand to support the needs of our customers. The increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to increases in current debt, accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and benefits, accrued expenses, and accrued rebates.
Debt and credit facilities - The $2.2 million decrease in total debt at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, resulted from debt repayments under our Term Loan.
Our sources of liquidity include our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, including outstanding letters of credit of $2.4 million, was $297.6 million. We do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. Please refer to Note 10, Debt, for further discussion of our Credit Facility.
Pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2022.
We believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our Credit Facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations to continue to meet customer demand.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
Contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods, and include the following material items:
•Our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods, amounted to $93.6 million, of which $48.3 million is due to be paid in 2022. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. The Company previously entered into a material supply agreement for butyl polymers used as a principal raw material in a broad range of the Company’s polymer-based pharmaceutical packaging products.
•Our long-term debt obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs including fixed and variable-rate debt further discussed in Note 10, Debt.
•Our operating leases obligations primarily related to land, buildings, and machinery and equipment, with lease terms through 2047 further discussed in Note 6, Leases.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position:
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances, such as a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions or a change in company strategy, increased competition, declining product demand, plans to dispose of an asset or asset group, or recent financial or legal factors that could impact the expected cash flows, indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. Impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The Company uses estimates that are consistent with its business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. Once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other expense (income) for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value. For assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. For assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. A goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. Amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. Changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. Accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test. Based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
Employee Benefits: We maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. In addition, we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled. Postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of January 1, 2017. The measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to a number of assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans. The assumptions, which are reviewed at least annually, are relevant to both the plan assets (where applicable) and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. Two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension expense are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age, rates of compensation increases, mortality and turnover, and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. For our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return, in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. One of the most critical assumptions in determining retiree mental plan expense is the discount rate. Under U.S. GAAP, differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods.
Changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. We estimate that every 25-basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by $0.7 million, and every 25-basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by $0.0 million. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. Our net pension underfunded balance at December 31, 2021 was $20.6 million, compared to $40.8 million at December 31, 2020. Our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was $5.6 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $6.1 million at December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes: We estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. In addition, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities. The enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. Changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.
When accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
