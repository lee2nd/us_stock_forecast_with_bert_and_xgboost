Nature of Operations
Live Oak Bancshares, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries including Live Oak Banking Company, the “Company”) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina, incorporated under the laws of North Carolina in December 2008. The Company conducts business operations primarily through its commercial bank subsidiary, Live Oak Banking Company (the “Bank”). The Bank was incorporated in February 2008 as a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank. The Bank specializes in providing lending and deposit related services to small businesses nationwide. The Bank identifies and extends lending to credit-worthy borrowers both within specific industries, also called verticals, through expertise within those industries, and more broadly to select borrowers outside of those industries. A significant portion of the loans originated by the Bank are guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) under the 7(a) Loan program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Rural Energy for America Program (“REAP”), Water and Environmental Program (“WEP”) and Business & Industry (“B&I”) loan programs.
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries are the Bank, Government Loan Solutions (“GLS”), Live Oak Grove, LLC (“Grove”), Live Oak Ventures, Inc. (“Live Oak Ventures”), and Canapi Advisors, LLC (“Canapi Advisors”). 504 Fund Advisors, LLC (“504FA”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company until 2019, when 504FA exited as the advisor to The 504 Fund, and the Company dissolved this legal entity.
The Bank’s wholly owned subsidiaries are Live Oak Number One, Inc., Live Oak Clean Energy Financing LLC (“LOCEF”), and Live Oak Private Wealth, LLC. Live Oak Number One, Inc. holds properties foreclosed on by the Bank. LOCEF provides financing to entities for renewable energy applications and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank during the first quarter of 2019. Live Oak Private Wealth, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Jolley Asset Management, LLC (“JAM”), provide high-net-worth individuals and families with strategic wealth and investment management services.
GLS is a management and technology consulting firm that advises and offers solutions and services to participants in the government guaranteed lending sector. GLS primarily provides services in connection with the settlement, accounting, and securitization processes for government guaranteed loans, including loans originated under the SBA 7(a) loan programs and USDA guaranteed loans. The Grove provides Company employees and business visitors an on-site restaurant location. Live Oak Ventures’ purpose is investing in businesses that align with the Company's strategic initiative to be a leader in financial technology. Canapi Advisors provides investment advisory services to a series of funds (the “Canapi Funds”) focused on providing venture capital to new and emerging financial technology companies.
The Company generates revenue primarily from net interest income and secondarily through origination and sale of government guaranteed loans. Income from the retention of loans is comprised principally of interest income. The Company had historically elected to account for certain loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in the net gain (loss) on loans accounted for under the fair value option line item of the consolidated statements of income. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company chose not to elect fair value for all retained participating interests arising from new government guaranteed loan sales. Income from the sale of loans is comprised of loan servicing revenue and revaluation of related servicing assets along with net gains on sales of loans. Offsetting these revenues are the cost of funding sources, provision for loan and lease credit losses, any costs related to foreclosed assets and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, travel, professional services, advertising and marketing and tax expense. The Company also has less routinely generated gains and losses arising from its financial technology investments in its fintech segment, as discussed more fully later in this section under the caption “Results of Segment Operations.”
Recent Developments
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused complex and significant adverse impacts on certain areas of the economy, the banking industry and the Company, all of which continue to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is magnified with the continued risk of a resurgence of the virus and new variants, which have recently caused cases to increase in the United States. Despite ongoing uncertainty, the economy continued to generally improve in 2021, resulting in positive impacts on the Company’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans and leases, loans carried at fair value, and net gains on sales of loans, as discussed below in MD&A.
Relative to Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans, the Company ended 2021 with a total outstanding balance net of deferred fees and costs of $261.9 million compared to $1.50 billion at December 31, 2020. During 2021, the Company recognized a $15.5 million increase in interest income arising from PPP loan amortization of net deferred fees combined with the 1% annualized interest rate leaving $6.5 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized into future interest income. The Company’s corresponding Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) used to help provide financing for the origination of PPP loans decreased from $1.53 billion at December 31, 2020 to $267.6 million at December 31, 2021. Borrowings under the PPPLF bear interest at a rate of 0.35%, and there are no fees paid by the Company.
Credit
In accordance with guidance from banking regulators, the Company has and continues to work with COVID-19 affected borrowers to help defer their payments, interest, and fees. At December 31, 2021 the Company had $1.1 million in unguaranteed loans and leases on payment deferral for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with $67 thousand in accrued interest receivable. In addition, the Company had $76.9 million in unguaranteed loans on SBA payment assistance at December 31, 2021. To date, almost all loans after expiration of assistance have returned to making regular payments.
In previous quarters of 2021, the Company has disclosed certain industries that have heightened levels of exposure as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, management identified six verticals that were considered to be “at-risk” of significant COVID-19 impacts. These verticals are hotels, educational services, wine and craft beverage, quick service restaurants, entertainment centers and fitness centers. Businesses within these six verticals have shown notable improvements throughout 2021. As of December 31, 2021, these verticals contained two loans with an aggregate balance of $2.7 million, $676 thousand of which was unguaranteed, still on payment deferral and 28 loans that continue to receive SBA payment subsidies with an aggregate balance of $37.6 million, $9.4 million of which was unguaranteed. While 2021 reflected positive signs of emerging from at-risk status, management continues to closely monitor these vulnerable verticals for signs of weakness.
The Company continues to work with customers directly affected by COVID-19 and is prepared to offer short-term assistance in accordance with regulatory guidelines. As a result of the uncertain economic environment caused by COVID-19, the Company continues to engage in more frequent communication with borrowers in an effort to better understand their situation and the challenges faced as circumstances evolve, which the Company anticipates will enable it to respond proactively as needs and issues arise.

The following is a summary of the Company's financial highlights and events for 2021:
•
Diluted earnings per share increased $2.28 or 159.9%, from $1.43 to $3.71, with key drivers of higher levels of reported net income outlined more fully in the opening to the section titled “Results of Operations.”
•
Total revenue, comprised of net interest income and total noninterest income, increased by $176.3 million, or 62.8%, to $457.0 million in 2021, with $102.1 million related to higher levels of net interest income and $44.1 million related to a gain arising from the Company’s investment in Greenlight Financial Technologies, Inc. (“Greenlight”).
•
Income tax expense increased $55.9 million, resulting in total income tax expense of $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was largely the result of $163.4 million more in income before taxes in 2021 considered against higher levels of tax benefits in 2020 arising from both the vesting of restricted stock unit awards with market price conditions and a tax benefit due to the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) in 2020.
•
Loan originations of $4.48 billion compared to $4.45 billion in 2020. Excluding PPP loans, total 2021 originations were $3.93 billion, an increase of $1.25 billion, or 46.3%, compared to 2020.
•
Loans and leases held for sale and investment increased by $317.4 million. Excluding PPP loans, total loans and leases increased $1.55 billion, or 32.2%, to $6.38 billion at the end of 2021.

Total nonperforming unguaranteed loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases held for investment decreased from 0.46% at the end of 2020 to 0.33% at the end of 2021.
•
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average held for investment loans and leases carried at historical cost, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were 0.08% and 0.44%, respectively.
•
Provision for loan and lease credit losses decreased $25.4 million, or 62.6%, largely due to continued improvements in economic forecasts.
•
Total deposits rose by 24.5% to $7.11 billion at the end of 2021 driven by funding needs for significant loan origination efforts during the year.
•
Borrowings under PPPLF, decreased from $1.54 billion to $267.6 million.
Business Outlook
Below is a discussion of management’s current expectations regarding Company performance over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and business strategies as of the time the Company filed this Report. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. See “Important Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on forward-looking statements.
The Company's results for 2021 demonstrated a continuation of strong underlying financial performance and solid growth momentum. Management continues to focus on building recurring revenue streams, promoting change within the financial technology industry, and building out selected existing verticals while adding new verticals to the Company's business model. Management anticipates that the Company's held-for-sale and held-for-investment loan portfolios will continue to grow as a result of healthy origination volumes and higher levels of loan retention that are intended to promote long-term recurring revenue and profitability, including the continued pursuit of potential opportunities in conventional lending outside of SBA or other government guarantee programs.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Statements included in this management's discussion and analysis include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is presented at the conclusion of this Item 7.
Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company without regard to certain transactional activities. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as reported under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. Management’s non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similar named measures represented by other companies, as they may be calculated differently.
Results of Operations
The Company reported net income of$167.0 million, or $3.71 per diluted share, for 2021 compared to $59.5 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, for 2020.
This increase in net income was primarily attributable to the following items:
•
Increase in net interest income of $102.1 million, or 52.4%, predominately driven by significant growth in total loan and lease portfolios, which was accentuated by the origination of PPP loans;
•
Equity security investments gains increased $29.8 million, or 200.2%, largely due to a $44.1 million gain related the Company’s investment in Greenlight arising from an increase in the observable fair market value of the Company’s investment through an arm’s length sale of a portion of its shares in the investee. The Company’s total gains in equity security investments in 2020 was principally comprised of a $14.6 million gain, also arising from increased fair value of Greenlight investments;
•
A decrease in the provision for loan and lease credit losses of $25.4 million, or 62.6%;
•
Net gains on sales of loans increased $17.8 million, or 36.0%;
•
The net gain on the valuation adjustment for loans accounted for under the fair value option of $4.3 million, increasing by $17.3 million, or 132.5%, from a net loss of $13.1 million in 2020; and
•
A lower loss on equity method investments of $13.0 million, or 88.3%.
Other key factors partially offsetting the year-over-year increase in net income were composed of the following:
•
An increase in noninterest expense of $38.3 million, or 19.9%, comprised principally of increased salaries and employee benefits of $12.4 million, professional services of $8.8 million, data processing of $5.8 million, renewable energy tax credit investment impairment of $3.2 million, loan related expenses of $2.7 million and travel related expenses of $2.4 million; and
•
An increase in income tax expense of $55.9 million. This increase was primarily due to the above discussed increase in net income and a to a lesser degree the lower level of tax benefits arising from restricted stock unit award vesting in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income represents the difference between the income that the Company earns on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company’s net interest income depends upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates that the Company earns or pays on them, respectively. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume changes.” It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as “rate changes.” As a bank without a branch network, the Bank gathers deposits over the Internet and in the community in which it is headquartered. Due to the nature of a branchless bank and the relatively low overhead required for deposit gathering, the rates the Bank offers are generally above the industry average.
For 2021, net interest income increased $102.1 million, or 52.4%, to $296.8 million compared to $194.7 million for 2020. This increase was principally due to the significant growth in the held for investment loan and lease portfolios reflecting the Company's ongoing initiative to grow recurring revenue sources combined with lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities. This increase over the prior year was further enhanced by the aforementioned revenue arising from PPP loans with a $15.5 million increase in interest income arising from amortization of net deferred fees combined with a 1% annualized interest rate. Accordingly, average interest-earning assets increased by $1.24 billion, or 19.4%, to $7.68 billion for 2021, compared to $6.44 billion for 2020, while the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points to 4.70%. The cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities for 2021 decreased 61 basis points to 0.87%, and the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.10 billion, or 17.4%, over 2020. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was largely driven by funding for significant loan originations and growth. As indicated in the rate/volume table below, increased interest-earning asset volume and yields and greater levels of cost declines of interest-bearing liabilities outpaced the higher volume of interest-bearing liabilities, resulting in increases to interest income of $72.8 million and decreases to interest expense of $29.3 million for 2021 compared to 2020. For 2020 compared to 2021, the net interest margin increased from 3.03% to 3.86%, respectively, due primarily to significant loan portfolio growth and the maturity of longer term deposits which are repricing at lower rates combined with recognition of PPP related income, which is being accelerated with forgiveness efforts. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $261.9 million in PPP loan balances on its books which includes $6.5 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized into future interest income. The Company expects to recognize most of the remaining net deferred fees for PPP loans in 2022.
In December 2021, the Federal Reserve released projections where the midpoint of the projected target range for the federal funds rate would rise to 0.9% by the end of 2022, to 1.6% by the end of 2023 and to 2.1% by the end of 2024. These projections imply approximately three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in 2022, followed by three in 2023 and two in 2024. There can be no assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur, and if they do, the amount and timing of actual increases are subject to change. See
