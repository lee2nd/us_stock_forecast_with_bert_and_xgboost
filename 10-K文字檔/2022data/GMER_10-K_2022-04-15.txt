ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have generated little revenue although revenue is anticipated to grow as we have completed the development of our website, sourced out suppliers for products to sell and sourced out customers to buy our products. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company and the revenue we generate from the sales of our products. We must raise cash to continue our project and build our operations.
Plan of Operation - Milestones
We are at an early stage of our new business operations. Over the next twelve months, our primary target milestones include:
Continue to achieve growth within our MicroBuddies™ vertical via ancillary gaming initiatives across a variety of interactive platforms initiative.
Continue to promote and increase players of the NFT Breeding game MicroBuddies™ to expand revenue generated by the various aspects of game play.
Launch the metaverse/virtual world gaming initiative within a well-established third party experience that has a large, already established, global reach. Continue to evaluate opportunities that have synergies to our existing business line and create continuing revenue streams.
Limited operating history and need for additional capital
There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance relating to our new business direction. We have generated little revenue. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $2,727,396 in assets compared to total assets of $16,305 as at December 31, 2020.

Going Concern
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements without further financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Future Financings
We will continue to rely on equity sales of our preferred shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders.
There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
