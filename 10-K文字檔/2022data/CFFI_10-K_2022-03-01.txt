ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition to current and historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to our future business, financial condition or results of operations. For a description of certain factors that may have a significant impact on our future business, financial condition or results of operations, see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” prior to Part I, Item 1. “Business.”
OVERVIEW
Our primary financial goals are to maximize the Corporation’s earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We track three primary financial performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals: (1) return on average assets (ROA), (2) return on average equity (ROE), and (3) growth in earnings. In addition to these financial performance measures, we track the performance of the Corporation’s three business segments: community banking, mortgage banking, and consumer finance. We also actively manage our capital through growth, dividends and share repurchases, while considering the need to maintain a strong capital position.
The following table presents selected financial performance highlights for the periods indicated:
TABLE 1: Financial Performance Highlights
Refer to “Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below, for information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Consolidated net income for the Corporation was $29.1 million in 2021, or $7.95 per share assuming dilution, compared to $22.4 million in 2020, or $6.06 per share assuming dilution, and $18.9 million in 2019, or $5.47 per share assuming dilution. The Corporation’s ROE and ROA were 14.77 percent and 1.34 percent, respectively, for 2021,
compared to 12.54 percent and 1.14 percent, respectively, for 2020 and 12.02 percent and 1.20 percent, respectively, for 2019.
The Corporation uses adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance, to provide meaningful information about operating performance by excluding the effects of certain items that management does not expect to have an ongoing impact on consolidated net income. Adjusted net income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 excludes the effects of charges related to pension settlement accounting, a gain upon sale of a pool of purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans, charges related to early repayment of borrowings, merger related expenses incurred in connection with the Corporation’s acquisition of Peoples Bankshares, Incorporated (Peoples), branch consolidation activity, and changes in tax law. Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted net income for 2021 was $30.0 million, or $8.20 per share, compared to $22.4 million, or $6.06 per share, for 2020 and $19.5 million, or $5.66 per share, for 2019. Adjusted ROE and adjusted ROA were 15.22 percent and 1.38 percent, respectively, for 2021, compared to 12.54 percent and 1.14 percent, respectively, for 2020 and 12.44 percent and 1.25 percent, respectively, for 2019.
Consolidated net income and earnings per share increased 29.9 percent and 31.2 percent, respectively, for 2021, compared to 2020. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33.8 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively, for 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in consolidated net income and adjusted net income for 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to higher net income of the community banking segment and consumer finance segment, partially offset by lower net income at the mortgage banking segment. The increase in earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share for 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to higher net income and fewer shares outstanding, primarily as a result of share repurchases.
A discussion of the performance of our business segments is included under the heading “Business Segments” in the “Results of Operations” section of this discussion and analysis.
Key factors affecting comparisons of consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows. Comparisons are to the prior year unless otherwise stated.
● Average loans outstanding at the community banking segment, excluding Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, increased 4.4 percent;
● Average loans outstanding at the consumer finance segment increased 8.6 percent;
● The Corporation recorded net provision for loan losses of $575,000 for 2021 on a consolidated basis, as additional reserves related to loan growth were partially offset by reserve releases at both the consumer finance and community banking segments. This represents a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $10.5 million;
● Interest expense decreased $5.0 million due primarily to lower rates and balances of time deposits and a shift in funding to lower cost deposits;
● The community banking segment recognized net origination fees related to PPP loans of $4.1 million for 2021, primarily as a result of PPP loans that were forgiven or repaid, compared to $1.6 million;
● Consolidated net interest margin was 4.26 percent for 2021, compared to 4.65 percent;
● The consumer finance segment experienced net recoveries at an annualized rate of 0.14 percent of average total loans for 2021, compared to net charge-offs of 1.54 percent, due primarily to continued improvement in the credit quality of purchased loans, borrowers benefitting from the effects of government stimulus programs during 2021 and 2020, and elevated values for used automobiles during 2021, which result in lower charge-offs upon sale of repossessed automobiles;
● The consumer finance segment’s average loan yield declined due to continued competition for non-prime auto loans and growth in higher quality, lower-yielding loans, including prime marine and recreational vehicle loans;
● Mortgage banking segment net income decreased 28 percent, as mortgage loan originations decreased 18 percent as compared to the record loan production experienced in 2020;
● C&F Bank amended its cash balance pension plan and closed the plan to new entrants hired after December 31, 2021. The amendment is expected to result in lower expense related to the cash balance pension plan as the number of active participants decreases over time. Separately, the community banking segment recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $1.3 million in connection with certain lump sum benefit payments during the year ended December 31, 2021;
● In 2020, the community banking segment sold a pool of PCI loans, recognizing a gain of $3.5 million;
● In 2020, the community banking segment voluntarily repaid certain borrowings prior to their maturity, incurring early repayment charges of $2.2 million; and
● In 2020, the Corporation recorded merger related expenses of $1.4 million.
Consolidated net income and earnings per share increased 19.0 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, for 2020, compared to 2019. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 15.0 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively, for 2020, compared to 2019. The increase in adjusted earnings per share for 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to higher mortgage banking segment net income, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses at the community banking segment, and the issuance of 209,871 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of Peoples.
Capital Management and Dividends
Total equity was $211.0 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $194.5 million at December 31, 2020. Capital growth resulted primarily from earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was partially offset by share repurchases and cash dividends during 2021. Under regulatory capital standards, the Corporation’s tier I capital and total capital ratios at December 31, 2021 were 13.0 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively, compared to 12.5 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2020.
The Corporation’s Board of Directors continued its historical practice of paying dividends in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation declared dividends of $1.58 per share. Annual dividends per share increased 3.9 percent over dividends of $1.52 per share declared in 2020. The Board of Directors of the Corporation continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light of changes in economic conditions, current and future capital levels and requirements and expected future earnings. In making its decision on the payment of dividends on the Corporation’s common stock, the Corporation’s Board of Directors considers operating results, financial condition, capital adequacy, regulatory requirements, shareholder returns, and other factors.
In November 2020, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized a program, effective November 17, 2020, to repurchase up to 365,000 shares of the Corporation’s common stock through November 30, 2021 (the 2020 Repurchase Program). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation repurchased $7.2 million of its common stock under the 2020 Repurchase Program. At the expiration of the 2020 Repurchase Program, the Corporation had made aggregate common stock repurchases of 151,538 shares for an aggregate cost of $7.5 million under that program.
On November 16, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized a new program, effective December 1, 2021, to repurchase up to $10.0 million of the Corporation’s common stock through November 30, 2022 (the 2021 Repurchase Program). Repurchases under the 2021 Repurchase Program may be made through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shares repurchased will be returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation repurchased 1,106 shares, or $56,000, of its common stock under the 2021 Repurchase Program.
At December 31, 2021, the book value per share of the Corporation’s common stock was $59.32, and tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $51.66, compared to $52.80 and $45.32, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Refer to “Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below, for information about non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Acquisition of Peoples Bankshares, Incorporated
On January 1, 2020, the Corporation completed the acquisition of Peoples and its banking subsidiary, Peoples Community Bank for an aggregate purchase price of $22.2 million of cash and stock. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation recorded merger related expenses of $1.4 million ($1.1 million after income taxes), of which $1.3 million (1.0 million after income taxes) was allocated to the community banking segment and $100,000 ($100,000 after
income taxes) was recorded as a holding company expense. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Corporation recorded merger related expenses of $709,000 ($653,000 after income taxes), of which $236,000 ($196,000 after income taxes) was allocated to the community banking segment and the remainder was recorded as a holding company expense. In the aggregate, in connection with the acquisition of Peoples, the Corporation recorded merger related expenses of $2.1 million ($1.8 million after income taxes). There were no merger related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021.
2022 Outlook
Management’s overall outlook for 2022 is positive as a result of the continued successes of our diversified business strategy and initiatives underway at each of our business segments; however, we will continue to face numerous ongoing challenges in 2022, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty and inflation, cyber security risks and increased competition in our markets due to increased adoption of digital platforms and the impact of data-driven commerce. The following additional factors could influence our financial performance in 2022:
● Community Banking: Growing our loan portfolio will continue to be our primary focus at the Bank during 2022. Despite the issues faced during 2020 and 2021, our lending team continued to focus on commercial lending, which contributed to growth in our commercial loan portfolio during 2021 despite significant repayments of PPP loans. Our asset quality remains strong at December 31, 2021, but numerous factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates and continuing inflationary pressures may indicate risks of deterioration in credit quality across the industry in future periods. In 2022, we will continue to expand our digital services, further leverage the Northern Neck market gained from the Peoples acquisition, focus on growing our deposits in markets that have higher business and population growth metrics, and strive to improve our operational efficiency.
● Mortgage Banking: C&F Mortgage generates significant noninterest income from the origination and sale of residential loan products into the secondary market. In 2021, the housing market remained very strong and interest rates remained near historic lows. Revenue from mortgage lender services offered through C&F Mortgage’s Lender Solutions division continued to increase due to new customers and higher loan production volume. Loan production and revenue in 2022 are highly uncertain and will depend on economic conditions and market factors beyond our control, including interest rates, housing inventory and loan demand. In addition, during 2022, C&F Mortgage anticipates it will continue to (1) compete to retain and attract qualified loan officers, (2) invest in technology to further enhance our fully digital application and document collection process and (3) grow our Lender Solutions division.
● Consumer Finance: C&F Finance provides automobile financing through programs that are designed to serve customers in the non-prime sector and marine and RV financing for borrowers in the prime sector. In 2021, record new loan volume was driven by consumer demand and our competitive business model. During 2020 and 2021, credit quality has consistently improved as we remain committed to pursue higher quality loan contracts and due to elevated values for used automobiles during 2021, which result in lower charge-offs upon sale of repossessed automobiles. In 2022, C&F Finance plans to continue to effectively diversify its business by generating higher quality automobile loan contracts and grow its marine and RV lending business. We anticipate that used automobile values may recede in the future from recent historical levels and that loan performance may deteriorate now that government stimulus programs that assisted many consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic have ended, both of which may lead to higher charge-offs of non-prime automobile loans.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the greatest likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below.
Allowance for Loan Losses: We establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge-offs for relevant periods of time, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, we consider a range of possible assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. Under alternative assumptions that we considered in developing our estimate of an allowance that will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021, our estimate of the allowance varied between $36 million and $41 million.
Impairment of Loans: We consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. We do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due. We measure impairment on a loan-by-loan basis based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. We maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. All troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are also considered impaired loans and are evaluated individually. A TDR occurs when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan by granting a concession due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. For more information see the section titled “Asset Quality” within this Item 7.
Loans Acquired in a Business Combination: Acquired loans are classified as either (i) PCI loans or (ii) purchased performing loans and are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.
PCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Corporation will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans are aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the “nonaccretable difference.” Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the “accretable yield” and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.
PCI loans are not classified as nonperforming by the Corporation at the time they are acquired, regardless of whether they had been classified as nonperforming by the previous holder of such loans, and they will not be classified as nonperforming so long as, at quarterly re-estimation periods, we believe we will fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.
The Corporation accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans’ contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair
value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. There is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date for purchased performing loans. A provision for loan losses may be required for any deterioration in these loans in future periods.
Goodwill: The Corporation's goodwill was recognized in connection with past business combinations and is reported at the community banking segment and the consumer finance segment. The Corporation reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators exist. In testing goodwill for impairment, the Corporation may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then no further testing is required and the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the Corporation elects to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. In the last evaluation of goodwill at the community banking segment and the consumer finance segment, which was the annual evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Corporation concluded that no impairment existed based on an assessment of qualitative factors.
Income Taxes: Determining the Corporation’s effective tax rate requires judgment. The Corporation’s net deferred tax asset is determined annually based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. In addition, there may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain and the Corporation’s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that estimates related to income taxes are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NET INTEREST INCOME
The following table shows the average balance sheets, the amounts of interest earned on earning assets, with related yields, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, with related rates, for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Loans include loans held for sale. Loans placed on a nonaccrual status are included in the balances and are included in the computation of yields, but had no material effect. Accretion and amortization of fair value purchase adjustments related to business combinations are included in the computation of yields on loans and investments and on the costs of deposits and borrowings. The accretion contributed approximately 26 basis points and 18 basis points to the yields on community banking segment loans and total loans, respectively, and 13 basis points to both the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to approximately 34 basis points and 23 basis points to the yields on community banking segment loans and total loans, respectively, and 18 basis points to both the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, and approximately 44 basis points and 29 basis points to the yields on community banking segment loans and total loans, respectively, and 23 basis points to both the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on loans includes, with respect to PPP loans, interest at a note rate of one percent as well as net deferred origination fees that are amortized based on the contractual maturity of the related loan or accelerated into interest income upon repayment of the loan. Accretion of net PPP origination fees contributed approximately 39 basis points and 27 basis points to the yields on community banking segment loans and total loans, respectively, and 20 basis points to both the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to approximately 16 basis points and 11 basis points to the yields on community banking segment loans and total loans, respectively, and 9 basis points to both the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest on tax-exempt loans and securities is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis (which converts the income on loans
and investments for which no income taxes are paid to the equivalent yield as if income taxes were paid) using the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent that was applicable for all periods presented.
TABLE 2: Average Balances, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates
Interest income and expense are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, by changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and by the interaction of rate and volume factors. The following table shows the direct causes of the year-to-year changes in the components of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. The Corporation calculates the rate and volume variances using a formula prescribed by the SEC. Rate/volume variances, the third element in the calculation, are not shown separately in the table, but are allocated to the rate and volume variances in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of each.
TABLE 3: Rate-Volume Recap
Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for 2021 increased to $85.9 million, compared to $84.2 million for 2020, primarily as a result of lower cost of deposits, higher accretion of net PPP origination fees and using deposit growth to fund higher average balances of loans and securities and repayment of borrowings, partially offset by lower yields on interest earning assets. The yield on interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 72 basis points and 42 basis points, respectively, for 2021, compared to 2020. Average earning assets grew $207.2 million, or 11.5 percent, in 2021 compared to 2020, and net interest margin decreased 39 basis points to 4.26 percent in 2021, compared to 4.65 percent in 2020. The net interest margin decline for 2021 as compared to 2020 was due primarily to (1) lower average yields on loans and other earning assets and (2) growth in lower yielding securities and cash reserves outpacing loan growth, partially offset by (1) lower average cost of deposits (including growth in noninterest-bearing deposits) and (2) using lower cost deposits to fund growth in loans and securities and repay borrowings.
Average loans, which includes both loans held for investment and loans held for sale, increased $30.6 million to $1.51 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. Average loans held for investment at the community banking segment increased $41.6 million, or 4.2 percent, for 2021, compared to 2020. Average loans held for investment at the community banking segment included $60.5 million and $59.7 million of average balances of loans originated under the PPP for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining increase in average loans outstanding at the community banking segment for 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to growth in the commercial real estate segment of the loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment at the consumer finance segment increased $26.6 million, or 8.6 percent, for 2021, compared to 2020 due to higher average balances of marine and RV loans, due to the continued expansion of the consumer finance segment’s purchases of those loan contracts, and higher average balances of non-prime automobile loans, due to higher loan originations resulting from greater demand for used automobiles and higher loan amounts. Average loans at the mortgage banking segment, which consist primarily of loans held for sale, decreased $37.6 million, or 22.0 percent, for 2021, compared to 2020, as a result of lower mortgage loan production volume and reducing the average holding period for loans held for sale, in 2021, compared to 2020, due to lower volume and increased capacity for the processing and sale of loans.
The overall yield on loans decreased 32 basis points to 5.86 percent for 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to lower average yields at the consumer finance and community banking segments, partially offset by changes in the
composition of the loan portfolio, as growth in higher-yielding loans at the consumer finance segment outpaced growth in lower-yielding loans at the community banking segment. The community banking segment average loan yield decreased 26 basis points to 4.49 percent for 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to lower market interest rates, especially on commercial real estate loans, and lower interest income on PCI loans, partially offset by higher accretion of net PPP origination fees. The average loan yield for the community banking segment includes, with respect to PPP loans, interest at a note rate of one percent as well as net deferred origination fees that are amortized based on the contractual maturity of the related loan or accelerated into interest income upon repayment of the loan. Net PPP origination fees recognized in 2021 were $4.1 million, compared to $1.6 million in 2020, and there were unrecognized net deferred PPP origination fees at December 31, 2021 of $679,000, which are expected to be recognized in 2022. The recognition of interest income on PCI loans, which were acquired in connection with past mergers and acquisitions, is based on management’s expectation of future payments of principal and interest, which are inherently uncertain. Earlier than expected repayments of certain PCI loans resulted in the recognition of additional interest income during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Interest income recognized on PCI loans was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The consumer finance segment average loan yield decreased 135 basis points to 11.30 percent for 2021, compared to 2020, due to purchases of loan contracts at lower yields than the portfolio average yield, partially as a result of lower interest rates for non-prime automobile loans and the consumer finance segment continuing to pursue loan contracts of higher credit quality, including prime marine and RV loans. The mortgage banking segment average loan yield decreased 2 basis points to 2.88 percent, as mortgage interest rates decreased throughout 2020 (although mortgage interest rates also began to rise in 2021).
Average securities available for sale increased $96.5 million for 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to higher purchases of securities. The average yield on the securities portfolio on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased 66 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020, due to purchases of securities in 2020 and 2021 at lower average yields relative to the average yield of the portfolio as a whole, increased calls of securities that were issued during periods of higher market interest rates and accelerated amortization of premiums on mortgage-backed securities as a result of increased prepayment activity.
Average interest-bearing deposits in other banks, consisting primarily of excess cash reserves maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $80.1 million during 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to excess liquidity resulting from deposit growth and decreases in loans held for sale. The average yield on these overnight funds decreased 62 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020. The Federal Reserve Bank decreased the interest rate on excess cash reserve balances from 1.55 percent at the end of 2019 to 0.10 percent by the end of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased the interest rate to 0.15 percent by the end of 2021.
Average money market, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increased $145.8 million for 2021, compared to 2020, and average time deposits decreased $41.4 million for 2021, compared to 2020. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $125.0 million for 2021, compared to 2020. Higher average deposit balances are due primarily to growth in consumer and business deposits primarily as a result of new accounts and liquidity from government stimulus programs. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 40 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to lower rates on time deposits and a shift in composition toward non-time deposits. Offered rates on interest-bearing deposit accounts were reduced in response to changes in market interest rates beginning in March 2020. While changes in rates take effect immediately for interest checking, money market and savings accounts, changes in the average cost of time deposits lag changes in pricing based on the repricing of time deposits at maturity. Rates on outstanding time deposits continued to decrease during 2021 as accounts at higher rates matured.
Average borrowings decreased $46.2 million for 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to the repayment of long-term borrowings in 2020, partially offset by the issuance of $20.0 million of subordinated notes by the Corporation and increases in balances of repurchase agreements with commercial deposit customers. The average cost of borrowings increased 61 basis points during 2021 compared to 2020, due primarily to the higher cost of the subordinated notes relative to the borrowings that were repaid.
The Corporation believes that it may be challenging to maintain net interest margin at its current level based on the effects of (1) continued pressure on loan yields at the community banking segment and consumer finance segment related
to the current environment of low interest rates and competition for loans, (2) the temporary effect on loan yields of recognition of net PPP origination fees, (3) possible changes in the composition of earning assets which may result from decreased loan demand as a result of the current economic environment (4) lower accretion of purchase discounts on loans related to acquisitions, which is included in yields on loans and (5) lower mortgage loan production and therefore lower average loans held for sale at the mortgage banking segment. However, if market interest rates rise to a meaningful degree in 2022, as some financial markets predict, the Corporation may benefit from higher yields on certain interest earning assets, which would be expected to outpace any increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities.
Discussion of net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Net Interest Income” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
NONINTEREST INCOME
TABLE 4: Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income decreased $5.4 million, or 10.0 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in noninterest income was due primarily to decreases in gains on sales of loans and mortgage banking fee income, partially offset by (1) increased debit card interchange income and service charges on deposit accounts at the community banking segment, (2) increased mortgage lender services income primarily as a result of new customers at the mortgage banking segment (3) a decrease in asset write-downs, included in other income, net, at the community banking segment and (4) higher income recognized in connection with investments in small business investment company funds, included in other income, net, at the community banking segment. Gains on sales of loans decreased as a result of lower mortgage loan production at the mortgage banking segment, which was partially offset by higher margins on loans sold, and the sale of a pool of PCI loans in 2020, which resulted in a gain of $3.5 million at the community banking segment. Asset write-downs at the community banking segment in 2020 included $298,000 of merger related costs recognized in connection with disposition of assets acquired from Peoples and $281,000 related to branch consolidation.
Discussion of noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Noninterest Income” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
NONINTEREST EXPENSE
TABLE 5: Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 2.0 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in noninterest expenses was due primarily to (1) early debt repayment charges at the community banking segment in 2020 incurred in connection with the voluntary early repayment of FHLB advances, (2) merger related expenses in 2020, and (3) provision for indemnifications at the mortgage banking segment, included in “Other expenses,” of $881,000 for 2020 compared to reversal of provision for indemnifications of $104,000 in 2021, partially offset by (1) a non-cash charge of $1.3 million related to pension settlement accounting at the community banking segment in 2021, as a result of lump sum distributions under the normal terms of C&F Bank’s cash balance pension plan during the year that exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting and (2) higher salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily at the mortgage banking segment.
There were no merger related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021. Merger related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $1.4 million, of which $501,000 was data processing expense, $336,000 was professional fees expense, $119,000 was salaries and employee benefits expense, $81,000 was occupancy expense, and $61,000 was included in all other noninterest expenses, while $298,000 was a loss on disposition of assets and was recorded in noninterest income. Merger related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $709,000, of which $614,000 was professional fees expense, $50,000 was data processing expense and $45,000 was included in all other noninterest expenses.
Discussion of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Noninterest Expense” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense on 2021 earnings was $9.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.5 percent, compared with $6.8 million, or 23.3 percent, in 2020 and $5.1 million, or 21.2 percent, in 2019. The Corporation recognized income tax benefits of $326,000 in 2020 arising from a change in tax law enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which changed the tax rate applied to certain net operating losses related to prior tax years of Peoples. The effects of changes in tax law are recognized in income tax expense in the period in which the changes are enacted. The Corporation’s consolidated effective tax rate was also affected by tax benefits of tax-exempt interest income that was lower as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2021 compared to 2020 and an increase in nondeductible executive compensation due to incentive based compensation and the timing of deferred compensation arrangements, partially offset by lower state
income taxes in 2021, as a greater share of income before taxes was earned at C&F Bank, which is not subject to state income tax, and income tax benefits recorded in 2021 related to branch consolidation activities of $107,000.
Discussion of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Income Taxes” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Corporation operates in a decentralized manner in three business segments: community banking, mortgage banking and consumer finance. An overview of the financial results for each of the Corporation’s business segments is presented below.
Community Banking: Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, the community banking segment comprises C&F Bank and C&F Wealth Management. Prior to the first quarter of 2021, the segment comprised only C&F Bank, and prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. The following table presents the community banking segment operating results for the periods indicated.
TABLE 6: Community Banking Segment Operating Results
The community banking segment reported net income of $14.1 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in community banking segment net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to:
● lower provision for loan losses,
● lower interest expense due to lower average cost of deposits and lower average borrowings,
● $2.5 million higher net PPP origination fee income, included in interest income,
● $2.2 million of early repayment charges in 2020 related to FHLB advances,
● $1.3 million of merger related expenses in 2020,
● higher average balances of loans,
● $1.4 million higher income from debit card interchange, overdraft and account maintenance fees,
● a gain of $399,000 related to the sale of an other real estate owned (OREO) property in 2021, and
● income tax benefits of branch consolidation activity in 2021 compared to branch consolidation charges in 2020;
partially offset by:
● lower average yields on loans, securities and cash reserves,
● a $3.5 million gain on the sale of PCI loans in 2020,
● a $1.3 million pension settlement charge in 2021,
● higher operating costs related to data processing and professional services, as a result of serving a growing number of customers,
● higher occupancy expense related to two financial centers opened in the third quarter of 2020, and
● benefits of a change in tax law recognized in 2020.
Adjusted net income for the community banking segment, which excludes the effects of the sale of PCI loans, early repayment charges, pension settlement charges, merger related expenses, branch consolidation activity and certain one-time tax benefits, was $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted net income for the community banking segment increased $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the items discussed above.
Net interest income for the community banking segment increased $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was due primarily to (1) higher average balances of interest earning assets, (2) lower average costs of deposits, resulting from lower rates and a shift in composition toward non-time deposits, and (3) lower interest expense on borrowings, due to lower borrowings outstanding, partially offset by lower yields on loans, securities and excess cash. Comparisons of interest income on loans were significantly impacted by recognition of net PPP origination fees, which was higher for the year ended December 31, 2021 than in the year ended December 31, 2020, and interest income on PCI loans, which was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to the effects of these items, higher average advances to fund loans at subsidiaries and loan growth contributed to the increases in interest income on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by lower average yields on other loans, especially commercial real estate loans, as a result of changes in interest rates. Higher average advances to subsidiaries resulted primarily from the repayment of a third-party bank line of credit at the consumer finance segment in the second quarter of 2020 that was previously used to fund consumer finance loans. Net PPP origination fees recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $4.1 million, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Deferred net PPP origination fees that remained unrecognized at December 31, 2021 were $679,000, which are expected to be recognized in 2022. Interest income recognized on PCI loans was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Provision for loan losses for the community banking segment decreased $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to qualitative adjustments to reserves due to the COVID-19 pandemic that were recognized in 2020 and a portion of which was released in 2021, as credit deterioration has not yet been experienced to the extent previously anticipated, and improvement in asset quality during 2021, including impaired loans, which were partially offset by provision related to growth in the loan portfolio in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we have not experienced significant declines in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes that PPP loans and other forms of government stimulus may have delayed and partially mitigated credit deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. However, if there are further challenges to the economic recovery, including a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that leads to economic disruption, additional provision for loan losses may be required in future periods.
There were no merger related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021. Merger related expenses at the community banking segment of $1.3 million ($1.0 million after income taxes) were recorded in the year ended December
31, 2020, of which $501,000 was data processing expense, $236,000 was professional fees expense, $119,000 was salaries and employee benefits expense, $81,000 was occupancy expense, $61,000 was included in all other noninterest expenses, and $298,000 was a loss on disposition of assets and was recorded in other noninterest income. Cost savings related to the integration of Peoples were realized primarily in salaries and employee benefits expense.
C&F Bank amended its cash balance pension plan and closed the plan to new entrants hired after December 31, 2021. The amendment is expected to result in lower expense related to the cash balance pension plan as the number of active participants decreases over time. Separately, the community banking segment recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $1.3 million ($995,000 after income taxes) in connection with certain lump sum benefit payments during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Branch consolidation activity resulted in income tax benefits recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $107,000 and pre-tax charges of $281,000 ($222,000 after income taxes) recorded in other noninterest income during the year ended December 31, 2020. Income tax benefits of $326,000 were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to a change in tax law enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which changed the tax rate applied to certain net operating losses related to prior tax years of Peoples.
Discussion of the community banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Principal Business Segments” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
Mortgage Banking: The following table presents the mortgage banking operating results for the periods indicated.
TABLE 7: Mortgage Banking Segment Operating Results
The mortgage banking segment reported net income of $7.7 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in mortgage banking segment net income of $3.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to (1) lower mortgage loan production volume, which resulted in lower gains on sales of loans and mortgage banking fee income as well as lower expenses related to mortgage loan production, (2) lower interest income due to lower average balances of loans held for sale and (3) higher salaries and benefits expense, primarily as a result of the addition of operations staff during 2020 in response to record origination volume, partially offset by (1) higher average margins on loans originated for resale, (2) lower provision for indemnification losses included in other expenses and (3) higher fee income from mortgage lender services as a result of serving a growing number of third-party lenders.
Discussion of the mortgage banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Principal Business Segments” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
The following table presents mortgage loan originations and mortgage loans sold for the periods indicated.
TABLE 8: Mortgage Loan Originations & Mortgage Loans Sold
Total mortgage loan originations does not include mortgage lender services.
Mortgage loan originations for the mortgage banking segment decreased 17.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, while remaining substantially above mortgage loan origination levels experienced prior to the record levels of 2020. We believe sustained historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and higher demand in the housing market have contributed to continued higher volume in the broader mortgage industry during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Production of the mortgage banking segment began to moderate beginning in the second quarter of 2021, and appears to have normalized as of December 31, 2021. Refinancings, which increased as a share of mortgage loan originations during 2020 compared to historical levels, declined for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, and purchase volume for the year ended December 31, 2021 has grown compared to the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which contributed to higher average margins on sales of loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gains on sales of loans, while driven in part by mortgage loan originations, also includes the effects of changes in locked loan commitments, which reflect the volume of mortgage loan applications that are in process and have not closed. Locked loan commitments decreased by $115.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and grew by $123.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Locked loan commitments were $83.4 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $198.6 million at December 31, 2020 and $75.1 million at December 31, 2019. Mortgage lender services fee income is derived from providing mortgage origination functions to third-party mortgage lenders. Mortgage lender services volume increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a result of business with new customers as well as higher volume with existing customers.
Consumer Finance: The following table presents the consumer finance operating results for the periods indicated.
TABLE 9: Consumer Finance Segment Operating Results
The consumer finance segment reported net income of $10.0 million and $7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in consumer finance segment net income was due primarily to lower provision for loan losses, partially offset by lower net interest income. Interest income decreased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to lower average yields on loans, partially offset by higher average balances of prime marine and RV loans and non-prime auto loans. Average yields decreased as a result of purchases of loan contracts at lower yields than the portfolio average yield, partially due to lower interest rates for non-prime auto loans and the consumer finance segment continuing to pursue loan contracts of higher credit quality, including prime marine and RV loans. Provision for loan losses decreased $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period of 2020 as a result of reserves recognized in 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of which were released in 2021, and lower charge-offs, partially offset by loan growth in 2021. Charge-offs at the consumer finance segment have continued to decrease as a result of continued improvement in the credit quality of purchased loan contracts, borrowers benefitting from the effects of government stimulus programs in 2021 and 2020, and a strong used car market, which results in lower charge-offs upon sale of repossessed autos. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. However, if there are further challenges to the economic recovery, including a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that results in economic disruption, additional provision for loan losses may be required in future periods. In addition, provision for loan losses may be higher in future periods if net charge-offs increase, including due to lower recoveries from sales of used automobiles if prices decline.
Discussion of the consumer finance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” under the heading “Principal Business Segments” in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
ASSET QUALITY
Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses
Allowance for Loan Losses Methodology - Community Banking and Mortgage Banking. We conduct an analysis of the collectibility of the loan portfolio on a regular basis. This analysis does not apply to PCI loans, loans carried at fair value, loans held for sale or off-balance sheet credit exposure (e.g., unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit). We use this analysis to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and to determine the necessary provision for loan losses.
The analysis, at a minimum, considers the following factors:
● Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting, collection, charge-off and recovery;
● Changes in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;
● Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans;
● Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;
● Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;
● Changes in the quality of our loan review system;
● Changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;
● The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations;
● The effect of other external factors, such as competition;
● Historical trends of actual loan losses based on volume and types of loans; and
● Significant one-time transactions affecting the allowance for loan losses.
In conjunction with the factors described above, we consider the following risk elements that are inherent in the loan portfolio as part of the analysis:
● Real estate residential mortgage loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral.
● Real estate construction loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule, the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may, at any point in time, be less than the principal amount of the loan. Construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor, who may or may not be a loan customer, may be unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project.
● Commercial, financial and agricultural loans carry risks associated with the continued successful operation of a business or a real estate project, in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate, because the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or project. In addition, there is risk associated with the value of collateral other than real estate which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision.
● Equity lines of credit carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral.
● Consumer loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral (e.g., rapidly-depreciating assets such as automobiles), or lack thereof. Consumer loans are more likely than real estate loans to be immediately adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
The review process generally begins with loan officers or management identifying problem loans to be reviewed on an individual basis for impairment. This review of individual loans is limited to those loans that have indications of probable loss or that may result in significant losses to the Corporation, while all other loans, which may include delinquent loans and loans classified as special mention or substandard, are evaluated as a group, as discussed below. In addition, all TDRs are considered impaired loans and are individually evaluated. We consider a loan impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. A loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected. If a loan is considered impaired, impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A valuation allowance is established for an impaired loan to the extent that this measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. When a loan is determined to be impaired, we follow a consistent process to measure that impairment in our loan portfolio. For collateral dependent loans we obtain an updated appraisal if we do not have a current one on file. Appraisals are performed by independent third party appraisers with relevant industry experience. We may make adjustments to the appraised value based on recent sales of similar properties or general market conditions when appropriate. We also estimate costs to sell collateral in the measurement of impairment if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan.
The remaining non-impaired loans are grouped by loan type (e.g., commercial real estate, commercial, residential mortgage, consumer). We assign each loan type an allowance factor based on the historical loss rate for that type of loan and an evaluation of the qualitative factors mentioned above to determine a general allowance. We assign classified loans (i.e., special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss) a higher allowance factor than non-classified loans within a particular loan type based on our concerns regarding collectibility. Our allowance factors increase with the severity of classification. Allowance factors used for unclassified loans are based on our analysis of charge-off history for relevant periods of time which can vary depending on economic conditions, and our judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment including the general economic conditions. Our analysis of charge-off history also considers economic cycles and the trends during those cycles. We may occasionally determine that certain groups of loans require no allowance for losses based on characteristics of those loans as a group, such as purchased loans that are initially recorded at fair value or loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Purchased loans other than PCI loans are evaluated in the manner described above, and an allowance is recorded to the extent that the recorded investment in such loans exceeds their outstanding principal net of the required allowance for loan losses. PPP loans require no allowance based on the explicit guarantee of the SBA. The allowance for loan losses is the aggregate of specific allowances and the general allowance for each portfolio type.
As discussed above we segregate loans meeting the criteria for special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss from non-classified, or pass rated, loans. We review the characteristics of each rating at least annually, generally during the first quarter. The characteristics of these loan ratings are as follows:
● Pass rated loans are to persons or business entities with an acceptable financial condition, appropriate collateral margins, appropriate cash flow to service the existing loan, and an appropriate leverage ratio. The borrower has paid all obligations as agreed and it is expected that this type of payment history will continue. When necessary, acceptable personal guarantors support the loan.
● Special mention loans have a specific, identified weakness in the borrower’s operations and in the borrower’s ability to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis. The borrower’s recent payment history may be characterized by late payments. The Corporation’s risk exposure is mitigated by collateral supporting the loan. The collateral is considered to be well-margined, well maintained, accessible and readily marketable.
● Substandard loans are considered to have specific and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the viability of the Corporation’s credit extension. The payment history for the loan has been inconsistent and the expected or projected primary repayment source may be inadequate to service the loan. The estimated net liquidation value of the collateral pledged and/or ability of the personal guarantor(s) to pay the loan may not adequately protect the Corporation. There is a distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies
associated with the loan are not corrected in the near term. A substandard loan would not automatically meet the Corporation’s definition of impaired unless the loan is significantly past due and the borrower’s performance and financial condition provide evidence that it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due.
● Substandard nonaccrual loans have the same characteristics as substandard loans; however, they have a nonaccrual classification because it is probable that the Corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due.
● Doubtful rated loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan that is classified substandard but with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high.
● Loss rated loans are not considered collectible under normal circumstances and there is no realistic expectation for any future payment on the loan. Loss rated loans are fully charged off.
Allowance for Loan Losses Methodology - PCI Loans - As previously described, on a quarterly basis we evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans. These evaluations require the continued assessment of key assumptions and estimates similar to the initial estimate of fair value, such as the effect of collateral value changes, changing loss severities, estimated and experienced prepayment speeds and other relevant factors. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows to be collected on a PCI loan will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. For a more detailed description, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in this Item 7.
Allowance for Loan Losses Methodology - Consumer Finance. The consumer finance segment’s loans consist of non-prime automobile loans and prime marine and RV loans. These loans carry risks associated with (1) the continued credit-worthiness of borrowers and (2) the value of rapidly-depreciating collateral. These loans do not lend themselves to a classification process because of the short duration of time between default, repossession and charge-off. Therefore, the loan loss allowance review process generally focuses on an analysis of charge-off history for relevant periods of time, which can vary depending on economic conditions. Further consideration is given to the following factors:
● Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting, collection, charge-off and recovery;
● Changes in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;
● Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans;
● Changes in the value of the underlying collateral;
● The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations;
● The effect of other external factors, such as competition;
● An overall analysis of the lending environment;
● Historical trends of actual loan losses based on volume and types of loans; and
● Significant one-time transactions affecting the allowance for loan losses.
Loans are grouped by loan type (e.g., non-prime automobile loans and prime marine and RV loans). We assign each loan type an allowance factor based on the historical loss rate for that type of loan and an evaluation of the qualitative factors mentioned above to determine a general allowance. Loans are further segregated between performing and nonperforming loans. Performing loans are those that have made timely payments in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and that are not past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans are those that do not accrue interest and are greater than 90 days past due.
In accordance with its policies and guidelines and consistent with industry practices, C&F Finance, at times, offers payment deferrals to non-prime automobile borrowers, whereby the borrower is allowed to move up to two payments within a twelve-month rolling period to the end of the loan. A fee will be collected for extensions only in states that permit it. An account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account. Thereafter, such an account is aged based on the timely payment of
future installments in the same manner as any other account. We evaluate the results of this deferment strategy based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections. Payment deferrals may affect the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses increases the allowance, and loans charged off, net of recoveries, reduce the allowance. The following table presents the Corporation’s loan loss experience for the periods indicated:

Consumer loans includes provision, charge-offs and recoveries related to demand deposit overdrafts.
For further information regarding the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, refer to “Nonperforming Assets” within this Item 7.
The allocation of the allowance for loan losses at December 31 for the years indicated and the ratio of corresponding outstanding loan balances to total loans are as follows:
TABLE 11: Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses
1 Includes the Corporation’s real estate construction lending and consumer real estate lot lending.
2 Includes the Corporation’s commercial real estate lending, land acquisition and development lending, builder line lending and commercial business lending.
Loans by credit quality indicators as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:
TABLE 12: Credit Quality Indicators
1 At December 31, 2021, the Corporation did not have any loans classified as Doubtful or Loss.
2 Includes the Corporation’s real estate construction lending and consumer real estate lot lending.
3 Includes the Corporation’s commercial real estate lending, land acquisition and development lending, builder line lending and commercial business lending.
Loans by credit quality indicators as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:
1 At December 31, 2020, the Corporation did not have any loans classified as Doubtful or Loss.
2 Includes the Corporation’s real estate construction lending and consumer real estate lot lending.
3 Includes the Corporation’s commercial real estate lending, land acquisition and development lending, builder line lending and commercial business lending.
The decreases in special mention and substandard loans rated at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 were due primarily to repayments.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at the community banking segment, excluding PCI loans, decreased to 1.44 percent at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.46 percent at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding all purchased loans and loans originated under the PPP was 1.55 percent at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.74 percent at December 31, 2020. The community banking segment recorded a net reversal of provision for loan losses of $200,000 in 2021, as a partial release of qualitative adjustments to reserves related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and improvement in asset quality were partially offset by additional reserves related to the growth in the loan portfolio. The community banking segment recorded provision for loan losses of $4.6 million for 2020 due primarily to qualitative adjustments to reserves established as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, there have not been significant declines in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic, although management believes the effects of PPP loans and other forms of government stimulus may have delayed and partially mitigated credit deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. However, if there are further challenges to the economic recovery, including a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that leads to economic disruption, additional provision for loan losses may be required in future periods.
The consumer finance segment’s allowance for loan losses increased by $1.3 million to $24.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $23.5 million at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 6.73 percent at December 31, 2021, compared to 7.53 percent at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the level of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans is primarily a result of improving credit quality of the portfolio, which has resulted in lower net charge-offs, and lower reserves based on qualitative adjustments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Total delinquent loans, which does not include loans that have been granted a payment deferral, as a percentage of total loans decreased to 2.16 percent at December 31, 2021 compared to 3.08 percent at December 31, 2020. The consumer finance segment experienced net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 0.14 percent of average total loans, compared to net charge-offs of 1.54 percent for 2020, due to a lower number of charge-offs during 2021 as a result of improvement in loan performance, and lower losses per loan charged off as a result of a strong used car market. Improvement in loan performance has resulted from the consumer finance segment continuing to purchase higher quality loans, including marine and RV loans. Additionally, borrowers benefitted during 2021 and 2020 from the government’s stimulus measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, these stimulus programs have generally ended, and the Corporation can give no assurance that loan performance or net charge-offs will continue at the
levels experienced in 2021 and 2020. The consumer finance segment recorded provision for loan losses of $820,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as provision related to growth in the loan portfolio was partially offset by a partial release of qualitative adjustments to reserves related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as credit deterioration has not yet been experienced to the extent previously anticipated, improvement in credit quality and lower net charge-offs. The consumer finance segment recorded provision for loan losses of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to qualitative adjustments to reserves established as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by improvement in credit quality. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. However, if there are further challenges to the economic recovery, including a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that results in economic disruption, additional provision for loan losses may be required in future periods. In addition, provision for loan losses may be higher in future periods if net charge-offs increase, including due to lower recoveries from sales of used automobiles if prices decline.
As previously described, the consumer finance segment, at times, offers payment deferrals to non-prime automobile borrowers as a management technique to achieve higher ultimate cash collections on select loan accounts. Payment deferrals may affect the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off. A significant reliance on deferrals as a means of managing collections may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The average amounts deferred on a monthly basis during 2021 were 1.24 percent of non-prime automobile loans outstanding, compared to 2.93 percent during 2020 and 1.90 percent during 2019. Payment deferrals increased for 2020 compared to 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic affected the ability of some borrowers to make timely payments, but were lower in 2021.
Because C&F Finance primarily focuses on non-prime borrowers, the anticipated rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses on the consumer finance loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by changes in general economic conditions. Changes in economic conditions may also affect consumer demand for used automobiles and values of automobiles securing outstanding loans, due to changes in demand or changes in levels of inventory of used automobiles, which may directly affect the amount of a loss incurred by C&F Finance in the event of default. While we manage the higher risk inherent in loans made to non-prime borrowers through the underwriting criteria, portfolio management and collection methods employed by C&F Finance, we cannot guarantee that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks. Beginning in 2016 with C&F Finance’s implementation of a scorecard model for purchasing loan contracts, the credit-worthiness of borrowers at origination has improved for automobile loans purchased by C&F Finance and the level of credit losses experienced has decreased. We cannot provide any assurance that C&F Finance’s net charge-off ratio will not increase in future periods. However, we believe that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses that have been incurred on existing consumer finance segment loans that may become uncollectible. If factors influencing the consumer finance segment result in higher net charge-off ratios in future periods, the consumer finance segment may need to increase the level of its allowance for loan losses through additional provisions for loan losses, which could negatively affect future earnings of the consumer finance segment.
Nonperforming Assets
A loan’s past due status is based on the contractual due date of the most delinquent payment due. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Loans greater than 90 days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest. For those loans that are carried on nonaccrual status, payments are first applied to principal outstanding. A loan may be returned to accrual status if the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and there is reasonable assurance the borrower will continue to make payments as agreed. These policies are applied consistently across our loan portfolio.
Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of like properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. We
may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less estimated costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the property valuations are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets and improvements are capitalized.
At the consumer finance segment, the repossession process is generally initiated after a loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. Borrowers have an opportunity to redeem their repossessed vehicles by paying all outstanding balances, including finance charges and fees. Vehicles that are not redeemed within the prescribed waiting period before C&F Finance has the legal right to sell the repossessed vehicle then become available-for-sale at the end of that period and are reclassified from loans to other assets and are recorded initially at fair value less estimated costs to sell. The difference between the carrying amount of each loan and the fair value of the vehicle (i.e. the deficiency) is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Accounts still in process of collection or for which the Corporation does not have the legal right to sell continue to be classified as loans until such legal authority is obtained. After the vehicles have been sold in third-party auctions, we credit the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles, and any other recoveries, to the carrying value of the repossessed vehicles. C&F Finance pursues collection of deficiencies, as allowed by state law, when it deems such action to be appropriate.
Table 13 summarizes the Corporation’s credit ratios on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
TABLE 13: Consolidated Credit Ratios
Table 14 summarizes nonperforming assets by principal business segment at December 31 of each of the past two years.
TABLE 14: Nonperforming Assets
Community Banking Segment
1 Acquired loans are tracked in two separate categories - “purchased performing” and “purchased credit impaired.” The remaining discount for the purchased performing loans was $1.1 million at December 31, 2021 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2020. The remaining discount for the purchased credit impaired loans was $4.7 million at December 31, 2021 and $5.9 million at December 31, 2020.
2 The principal amount of outstanding PPP loans was $18.4 million at December 31, 2021 and $78.7 million at December 31, 2020.
3 OREO includes $835,000 at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to the land and buildings of a former branch property, which was consolidated into a nearby branch in 2019.
4 Impaired loans includes $2.2 million and $2.7 million of loans on nonaccrual at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Impaired loans also includes $2.7 million and $3.6 million of TDRs at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
5 The ratio of ALL to total loans, excluding purchased credit impaired loans, includes purchased performing loans and loans originated under the PPP for which no allowance for loan losses is required.

Consumer Finance Segment
Table 15 presents the changes in the OREO balance for 2021 and 2020.
TABLE 15: OREO Changes
Nonperforming assets of the community banking segment totaled $3.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $3.9 million at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets included $2.4 million in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021
compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2020, and included $835,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2021, compared to $907,000 at December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans were comprised primarily of one commercial relationship at December 31, 2021 and 2020. OREO at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily comprised of a property previously used by the Bank as a branch, which was consolidated into a nearby branch in 2019. The property was subsequently sold in January 2022. If interest on loans on nonaccrual at December 31, 2021 had been recognized throughout the year, the community banking segment would have recorded additional gross interest income in 2021 of $214,000.
Nonaccrual loans at the consumer finance segment decreased to $380,000 at December 31, 2021 from $402,000 at December 31, 2020. As noted above, the allowance for loan losses at the consumer finance segment increased from $23.5 million at December 31, 2020 to $24.8 million at December 31, 2021, and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total consumer finance loans was 6.73 percent as of December 31, 2021, compared to 7.53 percent at December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual consumer finance loans remain low relative to the allowance for loan losses and the total consumer finance loan portfolio because the consumer finance segment generally initiates repossession of loan collateral once a loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. Repossessed vehicles of the consumer finance segment are classified as other assets and consist only of vehicles the Corporation has the legal right to sell. Prior to the reclassification from loans to repossessed vehicles, the difference between the carrying amount of each loan and the fair value of each vehicle (i.e. the deficiency) is charged against the allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2021, repossessed vehicles at fair value less estimated costs to sell included in other assets totaled $190,000, compared to $291,000 at December 31, 2020. If interest on loans on nonaccrual at December 31, 2021 had been recognized throughout the year, the consumer finance segment would have recorded additional gross interest income in 2021 of $4,000.
As discussed above, we measure impaired loans either based on fair value of the loan using the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, or using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. We maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. TDRs occur when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan by granting a concession due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. These concessions typically are made for loss mitigation purposes and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. TDRs are considered impaired loans.
Impaired loans, which included TDRs of $2.7 million, and the related allowance at December 31, 2021, were as follows:
TABLE 16: Impaired Loans
Impaired loans, which included TDRs of $3.6 million, and the related allowance at December 31, 2020, were as follows:
TDRs at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
TABLE 17: Troubled Debt Restructurings
1 Included in nonaccrual loans in Table 14: Nonperforming Assets.
2 Included in impaired loans in Table 16: Impaired Loans.
While TDRs are considered impaired loans, not all TDRs are on nonaccrual status. If a loan was on nonaccrual status at the time of the TDR modification, the loan will remain on nonaccrual status following the modification and may be returned to accrual status based on the Corporation’s policy for returning loans to accrual status. If a loan was accruing prior to being modified as a TDR and if management concludes that the borrower is able to make such modified payments, and there are no other factors or circumstances that would cause management to conclude otherwise, the TDR will remain on an accruing status.
The Corporation has accommodated certain borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by granting short-term payment deferrals or periods of interest-only payments. Generally, a short-term payment deferral does not result in a loan modification being classified as a TDR. Furthermore, certain modifications are not required to be evaluated for classification as a TDR under statutory and regulatory relief related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no modifications offered during the year ended December 31, 2021 which were not evaluated for classification as a TDR. The Corporation has granted loan modifications related to COVID-19 on aggregate balances of $103.6 million since the beginning of the pandemic. At December 31, 2021, loans whose modification periods had not ended had aggregate balances of $7.2 million and all such loans are performing in accordance with their modified terms, which includes payments of interest. Management monitors the credit risk related to these loans and has adjusted risk ratings as applicable as of December 31, 2021. Management cannot predict whether or for how long these borrowers may require further modifications of their loan terms beyond the existing deferral arrangement.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
SUMMARY
A financial institution’s primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets and sales of financial assets, while its major expenses are produced by the funding of those assets with interest-bearing liabilities, provisions for loan losses and compensation to employees. Effective management of these sources and uses of funds is essential in attaining a financial institution’s maximum profitability while maintaining an acceptable level of risk.
At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had total assets of $2.26 billion compared to $2.09 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable primarily to increases in cash reserves, available for sale securities and loans held for investment, partially offset by a decrease in loans held for sale and was funded by growth in demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings. The significant components of the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are discussed below.
LOAN PORTFOLIO
General
Through the community banking segment, we engage in a wide range of lending activities, which include the origination, primarily in the community banking segment’s market area, of (1) one-to-four family and multi-family residential mortgage loans, (2) commercial real estate loans, (3) construction loans, (4) land acquisition and development loans, (5) consumer loans and (6) commercial business loans. We engage in non-prime automobile, and marine and RV lending through the consumer finance segment and in residential mortgage lending through the mortgage banking segment with substantially all of the loans originated through the mortgage banking segment sold to third-party investors. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s loans held for investment in all categories, net of the allowance for loan losses, totaled $1.37 billion and loans held for sale had a fair value of $82.3 million.
Tables 18 and 19 present information pertaining to the composition of loans held for investment and the maturity/repricing of certain loans held for investment.
TABLE 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment
1 Includes the Corporation’s real estate construction lending and consumer real estate lot lending.
2 Includes the Corporation’s commercial real estate lending, land acquisition and development lending, builder line lending and commercial business lending (which includes loans originated under the PPP of $17.8 million and $76.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively). Other commercial, financial and agricultural loans were $699.9 million and $623.7 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The increase in total loans from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was due primarily to commercial loan growth at the community banking segment and growth in the consumer finance segment.
TABLE 19: Maturity/Repricing Schedule of Loans Held for Investment
Beginning in April 2020, the community banking segment originated loans under the PPP which are guaranteed by the SBA, and in some cases borrowers may be eligible to obtain forgiveness of the loans, in which case loans would be repaid by the SBA. Net PPP origination fees recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.1 million compared to $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Since the second quarter of 2020, the community banking segment has recognized $5.6 million of net fees under the PPP, and deferred net PPP origination fees that remained unrecognized at December 31, 2021 was $679,000, which are expected to be recognized in 2022. As repayment of PPP loans is guaranteed by the SBA, the community banking segment does not recognize a reserve for PPP loans in its allowance for loan losses. Table 20 presents the outstanding principal of loans originated under the PPP as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
TABLE 20: Paycheck Protection Program Loans
Total loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 included loans purchased in connection with the Corporation’s acquisitions. These loans were recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition without the carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. The following tables present the outstanding principal balance and the carrying amount of purchased loans that are included in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
TABLE 21: PCI and Purchased Performing Loans
For a description of the Corporation’s accounting for purchased performing and PCI loans, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in this Item 7.
Credit Policy
The Corporation’s credit policy establishes minimum requirements and provides for appropriate limitations on overall concentration of credit within the Corporation. The policy provides guidance in general credit policies, underwriting policies and risk management, credit approval, and administrative and problem asset management policies. The overall goal of the Corporation’s credit policy is to ensure that loan growth is accompanied by acceptable asset quality with uniform and consistently applied approval, administration, and documentation practices and standards.
Residential Mortgage Lending - Held for Sale
The mortgage banking segment’s guidelines for underwriting conventional conforming loans comply with the underwriting criteria established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and/or the applicable third party investor. The guidelines for non-conforming conventional loans are based on the requirements of private investors and information provided by third-party investors. The guidelines used by C&F Mortgage to originate FHA-insured, USDA-guaranteed and VA-guaranteed loans comply with the criteria established by HUD, the USDA, the VA and/or the applicable third party investor. The conventional loans that C&F Mortgage originates that have loan-to-value ratios greater than 80 percent at origination are generally insured by private mortgage insurance.
Residential Mortgage Lending - Held for Investment
The community banking segment originates residential mortgage loans secured by first and second liens on properties located in its primary market areas in eastern and central Virginia. The Bank offers various types of residential first mortgage loans in addition to traditional long-term, fixed-rate loans. The majority of such loans include 10, 15 and 30 year amortizing mortgage loans with fixed rates of interest. Second mortgage loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates. Second mortgage loans are granted for a fixed period of time, usually between 5 and 15 years.
Loans associated with residential mortgage lending are included in the real estate-residential mortgage category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Construction Lending
The community banking segment has a real estate construction lending program. We make loans primarily for the construction of one-to-four family residences and, to a lesser extent, multi-family dwellings. The Bank also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects, generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the community banking segment.
The amounts, interest rates and terms for construction loans vary, depending upon market conditions, the size and complexity of the project, and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors of the loan. The term for a typical construction loan ranges from 12 months to 15 months for the construction of an individual residence and from 15 months to a maximum of 3 years for larger residential or commercial projects. We do not typically amortize construction loans, and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan. The Bank offers fixed and variable interest rates on construction loans. We do not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis. For residential builder loans, we limit the number of models and/or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions, the builder’s financial strength and track record and other factors. Generally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for one-to-four family residential construction loans is 80 percent of the property’s fair market value, or 90 percent of the property’s fair market value if the property will be the borrower’s primary residence. The fair market value of a project is determined on the basis of an appraisal of the project conducted by an appraiser approved by the Bank. For larger projects where unit absorption or leasing is a concern, we may also obtain a feasibility study or other acceptable information from the borrower or other sources about the likely disposition of the property following the completion of construction.
Construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi-unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the Bank than residential mortgage loans. We attempt to minimize such risks (1) by making construction loans in accordance with our underwriting standards and to established customers in our primary market area and (2) by monitoring the quality, progress and cost of construction. Generally, our maximum loan-to-value ratio for non-residential projects and multi-unit residential projects is 80 percent; however, this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis.
Loans associated with construction lending are included in the real estate-construction category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Consumer Lot Lending
The community banking segment’s consumer lot loans are made to individuals for the purpose of acquiring an unimproved building site for the construction of a residence that generally will be occupied by the borrower. Consumer lot loans are made only to individual borrowers. These loans typically have a maximum term of either three or five years with a balloon payment of the entire balance of the loan being due in full at the end of the initial term. The interest rate for these loans is fixed at a rate that is slightly higher than prevailing rates for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We do not believe consumer lot loans bear as much risk as land acquisition and development loans because such loans are not made for the construction of residences for immediate resale, are not made to developers and builders, and are not concentrated in any one subdivision or community.
Loans associated with consumer lot lending are included in the real estate-construction category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
The community banking segment’s commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by the value of real property. The proceeds of commercial real estate loans are generally used by the borrower to finance or refinance the cost of acquiring and/or improving a commercial property. The properties that typically secure these loans are office and warehouse facilities, hotels, apartment complexes, retail facilities, restaurants and other commercial properties. Commercial real estate loans may be made to borrowers who will occupy or use the financed property in connection with their normal business operations or to borrowers who will use the subject propery to generate rental income. Loans secured by non-owner-occupied properties are made when: (1) the borrower is in strong financial condition and presents a substantial business opportunity for the Corporation and (2) the borrower has substantially pre-leased the property to high-caliber tenants.
Our commercial real estate loans are usually amortized over a period of time ranging from 15 years to 30 years and usually have a term to maturity ranging from 5 years to 15 years, with fixed rates of interest typically for periods of up to ten years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for a commercial real estate loan is 80 percent; however, this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis. Most commercial real estate loans are further secured by one or more personal guarantees. We believe these loan terms provide some protection from changes in the borrower’s business and income as well as changes in general economic conditions. In the case of fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, shorter maturities also provide an opportunity to adjust the interest rate on this type of interest-earning asset in accordance with our asset and liability management strategies. Certain commercial customers qualify for participation in an interest rate swap program. This program provides flexible pricing structures for our larger borrowers who wish to pay a fixed rate of interest, while preserving a floating rate for the Bank, which protects C&F Bank from exposure to rising interest rates.
Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are usually dependent on successful operation or management of the properties securing such loans, repayment of such loans is subject to changes in both general and local economic conditions and the borrower’s business and income. As a result, events beyond our control, such as a downturn in the local economy, could adversely affect the performance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. We seek to minimize these risks by lending to established customers and generally restricting our commercial real estate loans to our primary market area. Emphasis is placed on the income producing characteristics and quality of the collateral.
Loans associated with commercial real estate lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Land Acquisition and Development Lending
The community banking segment makes land acquisition and development loans to builders and developers for the purpose of acquiring unimproved land to be developed for residential building sites, residential housing subdivisions, multi-family dwellings and a variety of commercial uses. Our policy is to make land acquisition loans to borrowers for the purpose of acquiring developed lots for single-family, townhouse or condominium construction. We will make both land acquisition and development loans to residential builders, experienced developers and others in strong financial condition to provide additional construction and mortgage lending opportunities for the Bank.
We underwrite and process land acquisition and development loans in much the same manner as commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans. For land acquisition and development loans, we use lower loan-to-value ratios, which are a maximum of 65 percent for raw land, 75 percent for land development and improved lots and 80 percent of the discounted appraised value of the property as determined in accordance with the appraisal policies for
developed lots for single-family or townhouse construction. We can waive the maximum loan-to-value ratio for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis. The term of land acquisition and development loans ranges from a maximum of two years for loans relating to the acquisition of unimproved land to, generally, a maximum of three years for other types of projects. All land acquisition and development loans generally are further secured by one or more personal guarantees. Because these loans are usually larger in amount and involve more risk than consumer lot loans, we carefully evaluate the borrower’s assumptions and projections about market conditions and absorption rates in the community in which the property is located and the borrower’s ability to carry the loan if the borrower’s assumptions prove inaccurate.
Loans associated with land acquisition and development lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Builder Line Lending
The community banking segment offers builder lines of credit to residential home builders to support their land and lot inventory needs. A construction loan facility for a builder will typically have an expiration of 24 months or less. Each loan that is made under the master loan facility will have a stated maturity that allows time for the residential unit to be constructed and sold to a homebuyer under prevailing market conditions. Specific terms vary based on the purpose of the loan (e.g., lot inventory, spec or non pre-sold units, pre-sold units) and previous sales activity to new homebuyers in the particular development. Repayment relies upon the successful performance of the underlying residential real estate project. This type of lending carries a higher level of risk related to residential real estate market conditions, a functioning first and secondary market in which to sell residential properties, and the borrower’s ability to manage inventory and run projects. We manage this risk by lending to experienced builders and by using specific underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans.
Loans associated with builder line lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Commercial Business Lending
The community banking segment’s commercial business loan products include revolving lines of credit to provide working capital, term loans to finance the purchase of vehicles and equipment, letters of credit to guarantee payment and performance, and other commercial loans. In general, these credit facilities carry the unconditional guaranty of the owners and/or stockholders.
Revolving and operating lines of credit are typically secured by all current assets of the borrower, provide for the acceleration of repayment upon any event of default, are monitored to ensure compliance with loan covenants, and are re-underwritten or renewed annually. Interest rates generally will float at a spread tied to the Bank’s prime lending rate. Term loans are generally advanced for the purchase of, and are secured by, vehicles and equipment and are normally fully amortized over a term of two to seven years, on either a fixed or floating rate basis.
Loans associated with commercial business lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Equity Line Lending
The community banking segment offers its customers home equity lines of credit that enable customers to borrow funds secured by the equity in their homes. Currently, home equity lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates of interest that are generally priced at a spread to the prime lending rate. Home equity lines of credit are made on an open-end, revolving basis. Home equity lines of credit generally do not present as much risk to the Bank as other types of consumer loans. These lines of credit must satisfy our underwriting criteria, including loan-to-value and credit score guidelines.
Loans associated with equity line lending are included in the equity lines category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
Consumer Lending
The community banking segment offers a variety of consumer loans, including automobile, personal secured and unsecured, and loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit. The shorter terms and generally higher interest rates on consumer loans help the Bank maintain a profitable spread between its average loan yield and its cost of funds. Consumer loans secured by collateral other than a personal residence generally involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral or, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. However, we believe the higher yields generally earned on such loans compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans. These loans must satisfy our underwriting criteria, including loan-to-value, debt ratio and credit score guidelines.
Loans associated with consumer lending are included in the consumer category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment. This loan category also includes demand deposit overdrafts.
Consumer Finance
The consumer finance segment has an extensive automobile dealer network through which it purchases installment contracts throughout its markets. Credit approval is centralized, which along with the application processing system, ensures that contract purchase decisions comply with C&F Finance’s underwriting policies and procedures.
Finance contract application packages completed by prospective borrowers are submitted by the automobile dealers electronically through a third-party online automotive sales and finance platform to C&F Finance’s automated origination and application system, which processes the credit bureau report, generates all relevant loan calculations and displays the requested contract structure. C&F Finance personnel with credit authority review the transaction and determine whether to approve or deny the purchase of the contract. The purchase decision is based primarily on the applicant’s credit history with emphasis on prior auto loan history, current employment status, income, collateral type and mileage, and the loan-to-value ratio.
The consumer finance segment’s underwriting and collateral guidelines form the basis for the purchase decision. Exceptions to credit policies and authorities must be approved by a designated credit officer. C&F Finance’s typical automobile customers have experienced prior credit difficulties. Because C&F Finance serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources, we expect C&F Finance to sustain a higher level of credit losses in the automobile portfolio than traditional financing sources. However, C&F Finance generally purchases these contracts with interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources. These higher rates should more than offset the increase in the provision for loan losses for this segment of the Corporation’s loan portfolio. In limited circumstances, C&F Finance purchases loans that include third-party credit enhancements that limit C&F Finance’s exposure to credit losses on those loans. Beginning in 2016 with C&F Finance’s implementation of a scorecard model for purchasing loan contracts, the credit-worthiness of borrowers at origination has improved for automobile loans purchased by C&F Finance and both the interest rates charged and level of credit losses experienced have decreased.
In addition to purchasing automobile contracts through a dealer network, C&F Finance began purchasing marine and RV contracts, also on an indirect basis, through a third party provider in 2018. While the approval process is generally the same as the automobile approval process described above, borrowers on marine and RV contracts purchased by C&F Finance have not had prior credit issues and these contracts are considered prime. The rates charged on these loans are significantly less than the automobile portfolio with a much lower expected level of credit losses.
Loans associated with indirect automobile and marine and recreational vehicle financing are included in the consumer finance category in Table 18: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.
SECURITIES
The investment portfolio plays a primary role in the management of the Corporation’s interest rate sensitivity. In addition, the portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used as needed to meet collateral requirements. The investment portfolio consists of securities available for sale, which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and other similar factors. These securities are carried at estimated fair value. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, all securities in the Corporation’s investment portfolio were classified as available for sale.
Table 22 sets forth the composition of the Corporation’s securities available for sale in dollar amounts at fair value and as a percentage of the Corporation’s total securities available for sale at the dates indicated.
TABLE 22: Securities Available for Sale
Securities available for sale increased by $86.7 million to $373.1 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $286.4 million at December 31, 2020, due primarily to purchases of mortgage-backed securities, corporate and other debt securities and U.S. government agency debt securities with short maturities, in order to utilize excess liquidity by investing in debt securities rather than holding lower-yielding cash reserves.
The Corporation seeks to diversify its portfolio to minimize risk, including by purchasing (1) shorter-duration mortgage-backed securities to reduce interest rate risk and for cash flow and reinvestment opportunities and (2) securities issued by states and political subdivisions due to the tax benefits and the higher tax-adjusted yield obtained from these securities. All of the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities are direct issues of United States government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. Collectively, these entities provide a guarantee, which is either explicitly or implicitly supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, that investors in such mortgage-backed securities will receive timely principal and interest payments. The Corporation also invests in the debt securities of corporate issuers, primarily financial institutions, that the Corporation views as having a strong financial position and earnings potential.
Table 23 presents additional information pertaining to the composition of the securities portfolio at amortized cost, by the earlier of contractual maturity or expected maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
TABLE 23: Maturity of Securities
1. Yields on tax-exempt securities have been computed on a taxable-equivalent basis using the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent. The weighted average yield is calculated based on the relative amortized costs of the securities.
DEPOSITS
The Corporation’s predominant source of funds is depository accounts, which are comprised of demand deposits, savings and money market accounts, and time deposits. The Corporation’s deposits are principally provided by individuals and businesses located within the communities served.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, deposits increased $162.4 million to $1.91 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $1.75 billion at December 31, 2020. Demand and savings deposits increased $206.3 million and time deposits decreased $43.9 million during the same period. This increase in demand and savings deposits was due to increases in consumer and business checking accounts and increases in money market and savings accounts, partially as a result of balances shifting from time deposits to demand and savings deposit accounts, due to low interest rates on time deposits.
The Corporation had $5,000 in brokered money market deposits outstanding at December 31, 2021, compared to $6.1 million in brokered money market deposits at December 31, 2020. The source of these brokered deposits is uninvested cash balances held in third-party brokerage sweep accounts. The Corporation uses brokered deposits as a means of diversifying liquidity sources, as opposed to a long-term deposit gathering strategy.
Table 24 presents the average deposit balances and average rates paid for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019.
TABLE 24: Average Deposits and Rates Paid
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated amounts of total uninsured deposits were $573.5 million and $544.2 million, respectively. Table 25 details maturities of the estimated amount of uninsured time deposits at December 31, 2021. The estimate of uninsured deposits generally represents the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 and is calculated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for purposes of the Bank’s regulatory reporting requirements.
TABLE 25: Maturities of Uninsured Time Deposits
BORROWINGS
In addition to deposits, the Corporation utilizes short-term and long-term borrowings as sources of funds. Short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB may be used to fund the Corporation’s day-to-day operations. Short-term borrowings also include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are secured transactions with customers and generally mature the day following the day sold, as well as overnight unsecured fed funds lines with correspondent banks. Long-term borrowings consist of subordinated notes which rank junior to all future senior indebtedness of the Corporation and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Trust I, Trust II and CVBK Trust I are wholly-owned non-operating subsidiaries of the Corporation, formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred capital securities. Collectively, these trusts have issued $25.0 million of trust preferred capital securities to institutional investors through private placements and $775,000 in common equity that is held by the Corporation. Trust preferred capital securities of $5.0 million issued by CVBK Trust I, $10.0 million issued by Trust I, and $10.0 million issued by Trust II mature in 2033, 2035 and 2037, respectively, and are redeemable at the Corporation’s option. The principal assets of CVBK Trust I, Trust I and Trust II are trust preferred capital notes of the Corporation of $5.2 million, $10.3 million and $10.3 million, respectively, which have like maturities and like interest rates to the trust preferred capital securities. The interest payments by the Corporation on the notes will be used by the trusts to pay the quarterly distributions on the trust preferred capital securities.
Borrowings increased to $90.5 million at December 30, 2021 from $76.2 million at December 31, 2020 due primarily to a number of commercial deposit customers seeking to provide secured funding through purchases of securities under agreements to resell, and fluctuations in balances with these customers.
For further information concerning the Corporation’s borrowings, refer to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the heading “Note 11: Borrowings.”
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
To meet the financing needs of customers, the Corporation is a party, in the normal course of business, to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in addition to the amount on the balance sheet. The Corporation’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making these commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. We obtain collateral based on our credit assessment of the customer in each circumstance.
Loan commitments are agreements to extend credit to a customer provided that there are no violations of the terms of the contract prior to funding. Commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The total amount of unused loan commitments at the Bank was $305.4 million at December 31, 2021, and $327.0 million at December 31, 2020.
Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The total contract amount of standby letters of credit was $15.1 million at December 31, 2021 and $19.1 million at December 31, 2020.
The mortgage banking segment sells substantially all of the residential mortgage loans it originates to third-party investors. As is customary in the industry, the agreements with these investors require the mortgage banking segment to extend representations and warranties with respect to program compliance, borrower misrepresentation, fraud, and early payment performance. Under the agreements, the investors are entitled to make loss claims and repurchase requests of the mortgage banking segment for loans that contain covered deficiencies. The mortgage banking segment has obtained early payment default recourse waivers for a significant portion of its business. Recourse periods for early payment default for the remaining investors vary from 90 days up to one year. Recourse periods for borrower misrepresentation or fraud, or underwriting error do not have a stated time limit. The mortgage banking segment maintains an allowance for indemnifications that represents management’s estimate of losses that are probable of arising under these recourse provisions. As performance data for loans that have been sold is not made available to the mortgage banking segment by the investors, the estimate of potential losses is inherently subjective and is based on historical indemnification payments and management’s assessment of current conditions that may contribute to indemnified losses on mortgage loans that have been sold in the secondary market, including the volume of loans sold, historical experience, current economic conditions, changes in operational and compliance processes, and information provided by investors. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation reversed $104,000 of provision for indemnifications, as economic conditions, and particularly values of residential real estate, have improved, and, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation recorded provision for indemnifications of $881,000 due to a high volume of mortgage loan originations coupled with deterioration in economic conditions. There was no provision for indemnifications during the year ended December 31, 2019. The balance of the allowance at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Actual indemnification payments may differ materially from management’s estimates, which may result in additional provision for indemnification losses in future periods. There were no payments made in 2021 or 2020. Payments made under these recourse provisions were $66,000 in 2019.
Risks also arise from the possible inability of investors to meet the terms of their contracts. The mortgage banking segment has procedures in place to evaluate the credit risk of investors and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The Corporation’s derivative financial instruments include (1) interest rate swaps that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges on the Corporation’s trust preferred capital notes, (2) interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers and dealer counterparties and (3) interest rate contracts arising from mortgage banking activities, including interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on mortgage loans and related forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. For further information concerning the Corporation’s derivatives, refer to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the heading “Note 21: Derivative Financial Instruments.”
LIQUIDITY
The objective of the Corporation’s liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to satisfy the credit needs of our customers and the demands of our depositors, creditors and investors. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position are the components of a solid foundation for the Corporation’s liquidity position. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Corporation include cash flows from operations, loan payments and payoffs, deposit growth, maturities, calls and sales of securities, the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and the capacity to borrow additional funds.
Liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits at other banks, federal funds sold and nonpledged securities available for sale, totaled $454.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $222.9 million at December 31, 2020. The Corporation’s funding sources, including capacity, amount outstanding and amount available at December 31, 2021 are presented in Table 26.
TABLE 26: Funding Sources
We have no reason to believe these arrangements will not be renewed at maturity. Additional loans and securities are available that can be pledged as collateral for future borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) above the current lendable collateral value. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in our markets. Depending on our liquidity levels, our capital position, conditions in the capital markets, our business operations and initiatives, and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity or other securities or other possible capital market transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations.
Time deposits, maturing in less than a year, totaled $324.9 million at December 31, 2021; time deposits, maturing in more than one year, totaled $100.8 million.
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation has entered into contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. For further information concerning the Corporation’s expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2021, refer to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the headings “Note 9: Leases,” “Note 11: Borrowings,” and “Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.”
As a result of the Corporation’s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the Corporation maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its operational requirements and contractual obligations.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Total equity was $211.0 million as of December 31, 2021, compared with $194.5 million as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, the Corporation declared common stock dividends of $1.58 per share, compared to $1.52 per share declared in 2020 and $1.49 per share declared in 2019.
The assessment of capital adequacy depends on such factors as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, and changing competitive conditions and economic forces. We regularly review the adequacy of the Corporation’s and the Bank’s capital. We maintain a structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses. While we will continue to look for opportunities to invest capital in profitable growth, share repurchases are another tool that facilitates improving shareholder return, as measured by ROE and earnings per share.
Under the small bank holding company policy statement of the Federal Reserve Board, which applies to certain bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion, the Corporation is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. The disclosure below reflects the Corporation’s consolidated capital as determined under regulations that apply to bank holding companies that are not small bank holding companies and minimum capital requirements that would apply to the Corporation if it were not a small bank holding company.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation’s CET1 to total risk-weighted assets ratio was 11.5 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively; the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 13.0 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively; the Corporation’s total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 15.8 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively; and the Corporation’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.7 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively. These ratios include $25.0 million of trust preferred capital securities in tier 1 capital of the Corporation and $24.0 million of subordinated notes in Tier 2 capital. Additionally, all applicable regulatory capital ratios of C&F Bank were in excess of mandated minimum requirements at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
In addition to the regulatory risk-based capital requirements, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer of additional capital of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets as required by the Basel III Final Rule. Including the capital conservation buffer, the minimum ratios are a common equity Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. The Corporation and the Bank exceeded these ratios at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The Corporation's capital resources may be affected by the 2021 Repurchase Program, which was authorized by the Corporation's Board of Directors during the fourth quarter of 2021. Under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Corporation is authorized to purchase up to $10.0 million of the Corporation’s common stock. Repurchases under the program may be made through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shares repurchased will be returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock. The timing, number and purchase price of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other conditions, and there is no assurance that the Corporation will purchase any shares under the 2021 Repurchase Program. The 2021 Repurchase Program is authorized through November 30, 2022, and, as of December 31, 2021, there was $9.9 million remaining available for repurchases of the Corporation’s common stock under the 2021 Repurchase Program.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recent accounting pronouncements affecting the Corporation are described in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the heading “Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Significant Accounting Pronouncements.”
USE OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of the Corporation’s performance. These include adjusted net income for the Corporation and for the community banking segment, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted ROE, adjusted ROA, tangible book value per share and the following fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) measures: interest income on loans-FTE, interest income on securities-FTE, total interest income-FTE and net interest income-FTE. Interest on tax-exempt loans and securities is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis (which converts the income on loans and investments for which no income taxes are paid to the equivalent yield as if income taxes were paid) using the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent that was applicable for all periods presented.
Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures provides meaningful information about operating performance by enhancing comparability with other financial periods, other financial institutions, and between different sources of interest income. The non-GAAP measures used by management enhance comparability by excluding the effects of (1) items that do not reflect ongoing operating performance, (2) balances of intangible assets, including goodwill, that vary significantly between institutions, and (3) tax benefits that are not consistent across different opportunities for investment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP-basis financial statements, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these or similar measures differently.
A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation to evaluate and measure the Corporation’s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.
