Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Net income for Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $235.1 million ($4.98 per diluted common share) compared to $97.0 million ($2.18 per diluted common share) for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 142% increase in net income and a 129% increase in earnings per diluted common share. The results during 2021 were significantly driven by the effect of credits to the provision for credit losses compared to the prior year's results, which included the impact of the adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard ("CECL standard") and merger and acquisition expense. Net interest income grew 17% as a result of the combined growth in the commercial loan portfolio and the reduction in interest expense incurred on time and money market deposits, in addition to the significant reduction in borrowings. The Company's participation in the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP" or "PPP program") contributed to the year-over-year interest income growth associated with the commercial loan portfolio. The significant credit to the provision for credit losses during the current year was primarily the result of continued improvement of economic forecasts during the year. Non-interest income moderated in the current year as the decline in income from mortgage banking activities was offset by increases in other areas of non-interest income. Non-interest expense, exclusive of merger costs and the losses from early redemption of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB") borrowings, increased 12% predominantly as the result of increased compensation costs and professional fees.
Current year core earnings, which exclude the impact of the provision for credit losses and provision on unfunded loan commitments, merger and acquisition expense, loss on FHLB redemptions, amortization of intangibles and investment securities gains, each on an after-tax basis, were $211.9 million ($4.52 per diluted common share), compared to $189.4 million ($4.29 per diluted common share) for the year ended December 31, 2020.
These results reflect the following:
•Total assets at December 31, 2021, declined 2% to $12.6 billion, compared to $12.8 billion at December 31, 2020. During the year, excess liquidity, the product of deposit growth and PPP loan forgiveness, was used to reduce borrowings as well as fund the loan growth that occurred late in 2021.
•Total loans declined 4%, driven by a reduction of $874.4 million in PPP loans. Excluding the impact of the PPP forgiveness, total commercial loans grew by $681.1 million during the year, while residential mortgage and consumer loans declined a combined $255.1 million due to run-off. The second half of 2021 saw $2.1 billion in gross loan production, of which $1.5 billion was funded, that more than offset $873.8 million in commercial loan run-off. During the fourth quarter of the current year, funded commercial loan production increased to $937.3 million or 115% compared to $435.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year.
•Year-over-year deposits increased 6%, driven by 14% growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and 2% growth in interest-bearing deposits, reflecting the impact of the PPP program and the growth in transaction relationships, while time deposits declined $366.8 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio declined to 94% at the end of 2021 compared to 104% at the end of 2020.
•The net interest margin was 3.56% in 2021, compared to 3.35% in 2020. Excluding the amortization of fair value marks, the net interest margin for the current year would have been 3.52% compared to 3.23% for the prior year.
•The provision for credit losses was a credit of $45.6 million for 2021, compared to a charge of $85.7 million for 2020. The current year's credit for the provision for credit losses reflects the impact of the continued improvement in forecasted economic metrics, notably the rate of unemployment, anticipated business bankruptcies and the housing price index.
•Non-interest income decreased 1% to $102.1 million for 2021, compared to $102.7 million for 2020, driven by a decrease in income from mortgage banking activities which was partially offset by increases in wealth management income, service charge income, bank card fees and other non-interest income.
•Non-interest expense increased to $260.5 million for 2021, compared to $255.8 million for the prior year. The prior year included $25.2 million in merger and acquisition expense. The current year's growth included $9.1 million in prepayment penalties from the liquidation of FHLB advances, compared to $5.9 million for 2020. Excluding merger and acquisition expense and the prepayment penalties, non-interest expense rose 12%, driven primarily by increases in compensation costs and professional fees.
•The GAAP efficiency ratio was 49.47% in 2021 compared to 54.90% for the prior year. This improvement in the efficiency ratio is the result of the 13% growth in revenues exceeding the 2% growth in non-interest expense during the current year. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 46.17% for 2021, compared to 46.53% for 2020 as a result of the growth in non-GAAP revenue outpacing the growth in non-GAAP non-interest expense.
The Company’s non-performing loans represented 0.49% of total loans at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2020. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.11% for 2021, compared to 0.01% for the prior year.
Customer funding sources at year-end 2021, which include deposits plus other short-term borrowings from core customers, increased 6% compared to year end 2020. Deposit growth was 6% during the past twelve months, as noninterest-bearing deposits experienced growth of 14% and interest-bearing deposits grew 2% reflecting the impact of the PPP program and the growth in transaction relationships, while time deposits declined $366.8 million. Liquidity continues to remain strong due to the availability of borrowing lines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank and the size and composition of the investment portfolio.
Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 increased 3% to $1.5 billion, compared to December 31, 2020. Tangible common equity increased to 9.21% of tangible assets at December 31, 2021, compared to 8.61% at December 31, 2020 as a result of 2021 earnings, net of the $107.3 million repurchase of common shares, and the decrease in tangible assets during the past year. At December 31, 2021, the Bank remained above all “well-capitalized” regulatory requirement levels. Book value per common share was $33.68 at December 31, 2021 compared to $31.24 at December 31, 2020. Tangible book value per common share was $24.90 at December 31, 2021, compared to $22.68 at December 31, 2020.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $235.1 million, compared to $97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The results from 2021 included the positive effect from the credits to the provision for credit losses as forecasted economic metrics continued to improve throughout the year. The fourth quarter of 2021 experienced significant growth in the commercial loan portfolio and resulted in a provision being recorded during the quarter compared to a credit to the provision for the previous three quarters of 2021.
Net interest income increased 17% to $424.5 million compared to $363.2 million in 2020. The income generated by the PPP program, net of its associated funding costs, contributed a net of $25.7 million to the growth in net interest income year-over-year. The net interest margin improved to 3.56% for the ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.35% for the prior year. Excluding the net $4.1 million impact of the amortization of the fair value marks derived from acquisitions, the net interest margin for the current year would have been 3.52% compared to 3.23% for the prior year.
Non-interest income decreased 1% to $102.1 million for 2021, compared to $102.7 million for 2020. During the current year, income from mortgage banking activities decreased as mortgage loan originations declined in response to the rise in residential lending rates. Wealth management income increased $6.3 million, driven by the growth in the assets under management and the client base. In addition, service charge income, bankcard fees, loan prepayment fees and other non-interest income also experienced double digit growth from the prior year.
Non-interest expense increased 2% to $260.5 million for 2021, compared to $255.8 million for 2020. The current year's growth included $9.1 million in prepayment penalties from the early redemption of FHLB advances compared to $5.9 million for 2020. The prior year also included $25.2 million in merger and acquisition expense. Excluding the impact of these items results in a year-over-year growth rate in non-interest expense of 12%. This growth was driven by a combination of operational and compensation costs associated with the 2020 acquisitions, staffing increases, and incentive compensation associated with volume-based and performance benchmarks, in addition to increases in professional fees and services associated with certain strategic initiatives, intangible asset amortization, marketing and outside data services cost.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements may reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently rely more extensively on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value. A decline in the value of assets required to be recorded at fair value may warrant an impairment write-down or valuation allowance to be established. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in greater financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when readily available.
Management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results:
•Allowance for credit losses;
•Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment;
•Accounting for income taxes;
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) represents management's judgement of an estimated amount of lifetime expected losses that may be incurred on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date. This estimate is based on the risk characteristics of each segment of the loan portfolio, historical losses and defaults, an expectation of supportable future economic conditions and payment performance of the Company’s borrowers. The Company’s methodology for estimating the allowance includes a collective quantified reserve, a collective qualitative reserve and individual allowances on specific credits. Loans are pooled into segments based on similar characteristics of borrowers, collateral types, types of associated industries and business purposes of the loans. Accordingly, the determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and applies significant and highly subjective estimates. The use of significant judgement and the estimates of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio may vary significantly from actual amounts incurred. While management utilizes available applicable data to recognize expected losses, based on changes in the behavior of the portfolio in response to interest rates and economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio and the financial condition of the respective borrowers, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. The reasonableness of the allowance and the underlying methodology applied to determine the estimate is reviewed periodically by the Risk Committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by the same committee of the board.
Further details regarding the methodologies applied to estimate the various components of the allowance are provided in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information regarding the management of credit risk and changes in the allowance for credit losses during the period is provided in those sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 55.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment
Current accounting guidance provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company assesses qualitative factors on a quarterly basis. Based on the assessment of these qualitative factors, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than the carrying value, then performing the impairment process is not necessary. However, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value exceeds the fair value a quantified analysis is required to determine whether an impairment exists. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the Company to use a degree of subjectivity. The Company has applied this accounting guidance with respect to its Community Banking, Investment Management and Insurance segments.
Annually, the Company performs an impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 of each year. During the year, any triggering event that occurs may affect goodwill and could require an impairment assessment. Based upon the lack of triggering events the Company concluded in its annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that no impairment has occurred on October 1 nor December 31.
Other intangible assets have finite lives and are reviewed for impairment annually. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line or sum-of-the-years basis over varying periods that initially did not exceed 15 years. Intangible assets are reviewed or analyzed periodically to determine if it appears that their value has diminished beyond the value in the financial statements. The review or analysis of the intangible assets did not indicate that any impairment has occurred during 2021.
Refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the Company’s accounting policy for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company’s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management’s judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management’s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.
Refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the Company’s accounting policy for Income Taxes.

Net Interest Income
The largest source of the Company’s operating revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this discussion and analysis, the interest earned on tax-advantaged loans and tax-exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes. The result is referred to as tax-equivalent interest income and tax-equivalent net interest income. The following discussion of net interest income should be considered in conjunction with the impact of the acquisition of Revere in the second quarter of 2020 and a review of the information provided in the table that provides yields and rates on average balances.
2021 vs. 2020
Net interest income for 2021 was $424.5 million, compared to $363.2 million for 2020, a 17% increase. This $61.4 million increase was driven by a 13% increase in interest income from the commercial loan portfolio growth and the 57% decrease in interest expense during the current year. During the year, average interest-earning assets grew 10% while interest-bearing liabilities remained stable, as the 14% increase in lower rate average interest-bearing deposits was offset by the 63% reduction in more expensive borrowings. Excess liquidity resulting from deposit growth and PPP loan forgiveness was used to reduce borrowings as well as fund loan growth. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2021 was $428.2 million, compared to $367.3 million for 2020. The drivers of the positive effects on net interest income were partially mitigated by a decrease in interest income from the investment securities and mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. The PPP program, net of its funding cost, contributed $44.7 million to the growth in net interest income during the current year compared to $19.0 million in the prior year. An analysis of the net interest income performance is presented in the following tables.
For the current year, the net interest margin improved to 3.56%, compared to 3.35% for the prior year. Excluding the net impact of the $4.1 million in amortization of the fair value marks derived from acquisitions, the net interest margin for the current year would have been 3.52%. The net interest margin for 2020, excluding the amortization of fair value marks, would have been 3.23%.
2020 vs. 2019
Net interest income for 2020 was $363.2 million, compared to $265.3 million for 2019, a 37% increase. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2020 was $367.3 million, compared to $270.1 million for 2019. The growth in net interest income during 2020 from 2019 primarily reflected the effects of the Revere Bank acquisition. This growth was tempered by the impact of the 68 basis point decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets, which grew 42% during the period, as this impact was partially offset by the positive effect of the 74 basis point decline in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which grew 39%. Overall, the net interest margin decreased to 3.35% for 2020 compared to 3.51% for 2019.
Excluding the $12.7 million net impact of the amortization of the fair value marks derived from acquisitions, the net interest margin for 2020 would have been 3.23%. The amortization of the fair value marks recognized during 2020 included a benefit realized from the accelerated amortization of the $5.9 million purchase premium on acquired FHLB advances as a result of the prepayment of those borrowings. The net interest margin for 2019, excluding the fair value marks, would have been 3.46%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the income generated by the PPP program, net of its associated funding costs, was $19.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans.
Consolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates
(1)Tax-equivalent income has been adjusted using the combined marginal federal and state rate of 25.64% for 2021, and 25.54% for both 2020 and 2019. The annualized taxable-equivalent adjustments utilized in the above table to compute yields aggregated to $3.7 million, $4.1 million and $4.7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)The calculation of the respective yield or rate for each asset or liability category is based on the underlying interest accrual methodology for the individual products in accordance with their contractual terms.
(3)Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances.
(4)Available-for-sale investments are presented at amortized cost.
Effect of Volume and Rate Changes on Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income
The following table analyzes the reasons for the changes from year-to-year in the principal elements that comprise net tax-equivalent interest income:
* Variances that are the combined effect of volume and rate, but cannot be separately identified, are allocated to the volume and rate variances based on their respective relative amounts.
Interest Income
2021 vs. 2020
The Company's total tax-equivalent interest income increased 6% during 2021 compared to the prior year due to a combined product of the full year's impact of the Revere acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2020, loan fees from the participation in the PPP program and the growth in the non-PPP commercial loan portfolios. The overall positive impact of these items on interest income was partially mitigated by a decline of 19% in interest income on the residential and consumer loan portfolio and an 11% decline in interest income on investment securities. Year-over-year, the average yield on the loan portfolio decreased by one basis point while the average yield on the investment securities decreased 39 basis points. Despite the declining average yields in 2021 on the majority of interest-earning assets, the positive impact from the $44.7 million in interest and fees received on PPP loans during 2021 contributed significantly to minimize the decline in the overall yield on the loan portfolio and softened the impact of the interest rate declines in the market on the total yield on interest-earning assets during 2021 compared to 2020. During 2021, total average balances of consumer loans and residential mortgage loans decreased, both reflecting the impact of the loan refinance and origination activity during the current year. The vast majority of mortgage loans originated during the year were sold in the secondary market while customers took advantage of the opportunity to eliminate their home equity lines and loans by including those balances in their refinanced mortgages. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value amortization from the Revere acquisition reduced interest income $1.8 million compared to $0.6 million for the previous year.
2020 vs. 2019
The Company's total tax-equivalent interest income increased 21% during 2020, compared to 2019 driven by the Revere acquisition in the second quarter of 2020, as average loans and investments grew 42% and 38%, respectively. The average yield on loans decreased 60 basis points, while the average yield on investments decreased 88 basis points, both driven by the low interest rate environment that prevailed during 2020, a resultant effect of the pandemic. The increase in the average loan balances was the result of growth of the commercial loan portfolio. Consumer loans increased modestly while mortgage loans decreased, both reflecting the impact of the loan refinance and origination activity during 2020. The majority of mortgage loans originated during 2020 were sold in the secondary market. In addition, the Company's participation in the PPP program resulted in interest income of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans.
Interest Expense
2021 vs. 2020
Interest expense decreased by $34.6 million or 57% in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in interest expense was driven by declining interest rates during the current year, in addition to the 63% reduction in average borrowings during the year. The decline in interest rates during 2021 compared to the prior year resulted in a 31 basis point decline in the average rate paid on money market accounts and an 84 basis point decline in the average rate paid on time deposits, while the average rate paid on borrowings rose 78 basis points. The combination of large average balance decreases in time deposits at lower average rates and borrowings at higher average rates provided an additional benefit to the overall rate decline in interest-bearing liabilities even as average money market, savings and demand deposit balances experienced significant growth. The increase in lower cost funding sources as average interest-bearing demand deposits increased 34% and regular savings deposits increased 29% during the year, contributed to a reduction in interest expense from the prior year. During the year, average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 29%, primarily from the funding provided to customers under the second round of the PPP program, which benefited the Company's overall funding costs and net interest margin. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value amortization from the Revere acquisition reduced interest expense by $6.0 million compared to $13.3 million for the previous year.
2020 vs. 2019
Interest expense decreased by $22.2 million or 27% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in interest expense was driven by declining interest rates during the year partially offset by the 39% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulting from the Revere acquisition. The significant decline in interest rates during 2020 resulted in a 100 basis point decline in the average rate paid on money market accounts while the average rate paid on time deposits decreased 70 basis points and the average rate paid on borrowings fell 95 basis points compared to 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company's interest expense incurred for the use of Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility ("PPPLF") as a result of its participation in the PPP program was $1.1 million. During 2020, average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 57% compared to 2019. The funding provided to customers under the PPP program contributed to the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, which benefited the Company's overall funding costs and net interest margin.
Interest Rate Performance
2021 vs. 2020
The Company’s net interest margin increased to 3.56% for 2021 compared to 3.35% for 2020, while the net interest spread increased to 3.42% in 2021 compared to 3.08% in 2020. The increase in the spread was the result of the decrease in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities exceeding the decrease in the yields earned on interest-earning assets. The increase in the net interest margin from the prior year is the result of the decline in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 47 basis points exceeding the 13 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earning assets. Growth in both the average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities mainly as a result of the PPP program, the reduction of borrowings and higher cost deposit products, in combination with yield and rate declines, resulted in interest expense decreasing 57% while tax-equivalent interest income increased 6% during the year. Excluding the impact of the amortization of the fair value marks derived from acquisitions, the net interest margin for the current year would have been 3.52% compared to 3.23% for 2020.
2020 vs. 2019
The Company’s net interest margin decreased to 3.35% for 2020 compared to 3.51% for 2019 while the net interest spread increased to 3.08% in 2020 compared to 3.02% in 2019. The increase in the spread was the result of the decrease in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities exceeding the decrease in the yields earned on interest-earning assets. The decrease in the net interest margin in 2020 from 2019 is the result of the impact of the declining interest rate environment as the yield on interest-earning assets decreased 68 basis points while being partially offset by the 74 basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The growth of both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as a result of the Revere acquisition, in combination with yield and rate declines, resulted in interest expense decreasing 27% while tax-equivalent interest income increased 21% during 2020. However, as a result of interest-earning asset growth exceeding the growth in interest-bearing liabilities, the declines in yields/rates resulted in the overall compression of the net interest margin in 2020. Excluding the impact of the amortization of the fair value marks derived from acquisitions, the net interest margin for 2020 would have been 3.23% compared to 3.46% for 2019.
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income amounts and trends are presented in the following table for the years indicated:
2021 vs. 2020
Total non-interest income decreased 1% to $102.1 million for 2021, compared to $102.7 million for 2020. During the current year, increases in wealth management income, bank card fees and service charge income, and prepayment penalty fees, along with an increase other non-interest income, mitigated the impact of the decrease in income in mortgage banking activities.
Wealth management income is comprised of income from trust and estate services provided by the Bank and investment management fees earned by West Financial and RPJ, the Company’s investment management subsidiaries. Wealth management income grew 21% during 2021 from 2020. The growth in income was driven directly by the $927 million year-over-year growth in assets under
management. Investment management fees from West Financial and RPJ increased 25% and trust services fees, primarily recurring fiduciary and trust management fees, increased 13% compared to the prior year. Overall, total assets under management by trust and wealth management grew to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Service charges on deposits increased 17% in 2021 compared to the prior year, which reflected the impact of 2020's temporary suspension of certain service fees as well as lower transaction volume, both a resulting reaction to the pandemic. Insurance agency commissions for the year ended December 31, 2021 grew 3% compared to the prior year as a result of increased commercial and physician's professional liability insurance commission income. The Company invests in bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") products in order to manage the cost of employee benefit plans. Income from BOLI increased 5% in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the increase in BOLI investments, a result of the new policies added during the year and from the Revere acquisition. At December 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of BOLI increased to $147.5 million as compared to $126.9 million at December 31, 2020. These policies are diversified by carrier in accordance with defined policies and practices. The average tax-equivalent yield on these insurance contract assets declined to 2.91% for 2021 compared to 3.09% for the prior year due to the declining interest rate environment during the current year. Bank card fees grew 22% compared to the prior year as a result of increased transaction volume. The combination of credit-related fees increased $1.3 million year-over-year, driven by prepayment penalty fees associated with commercial loans. Other non-interest income also grew 86% compared to the prior year primarily as the result of the combination of the full payoff of a purchased credit deteriorated loan, credit related fees and activity-based contractual vendor incentives.
2020 vs. 2019
Total non-interest income increased 44% to $102.7 million for 2020, compared to $71.3 million for 2019. The year ended December 31, 2020, included gains on sales of investment securities of $0.5 million compared to $0.1 million in 2019. Additionally, non-interest income in 2019 included life insurance mortality proceeds of $0.6 million. The increase in non-interest income was driven by increases in income from mortgage banking activities, wealth management income and credit-related fees from customers. The combined increases of these activities more than exceeded the decline in deposit services fees.
Service charges on deposits increased 27% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in consumer activity and the Company's decision to temporarily waive certain transaction fees to ease the burden of the pandemic on customers. Wealth management income grew 35% during 2020 from 2019 driven primarily by the first quarter 2020 acquisition of RPJ. Trust services fees increased 3% compared to 2019, due to an increase in recurring fiduciary and trust management fees. Investment management fees from West Financial and RPJ increased 73% during 2020 compared to 2019. Overall total assets under management by trust and wealth management grew to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Insurance agency commissions for the year ended December 31, 2020 grew 3% compared to 2019 due to increased contingent income and growth in physician's professional liability insurance. Income from BOLI decreased 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the lack of mortality proceeds in 2020 compared to the $0.6 million in proceeds that were received in 2019. At December 31, 2020, the total carrying amount of BOLI investments increased to $126.9 million as compared to $113.2 million at December 31, 2019 as a result of the addition of policies held by Revere. The average tax-equivalent yield on these insurance contract assets declined to 3.09% for 2020 compared to 3.80% for 2019 due to the declining interest rate environment during 2020. Bank card fees remained level from 2019 due to diminished activity related to the impact of the pandemic. Credit related fees and other non-interest income comprised of commercial loan portfolio sourced fees and miscellaneous income increased 5% during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of fees related to the commercial portfolio.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expense amounts and trends are presented in the following table for the years indicated:
2021 vs. 2020
Non-interest expenses increased $4.7 million to $260.5 million in 2021 compared to $255.8 million in 2020. The current year included $9.1 million in prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings compared to $5.9 million in prepayment penalties in the prior year. The prior year also included $25.2 million in merger and acquisition expense. Excluding the impact of these items resulted in a year-over-year growth rate in non-interest expense of 12%. This growth was driven by a combination of a full year's operational and compensation costs associated with the prior year acquisitions, staffing increases, and incentive compensation, in addition to increases in professional fees and services associated with certain strategic initiatives, intangible asset amortization, marketing and outside data services cost.
Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased 16% in 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily in response to increased compensation costs associated with performance and production benchmarks, in addition to an increase in operational resulting from a full year of costs associated with the 2020 acquisitions and general staffing increases. The average number of full-time equivalent employees increased to 1,155 in 2021 compared to 1,080 for 2020. Benefit expense increased 26% during the current year due to a combination of increases in health insurance, pension cost, 401(k) plan contribution expense, stock compensation expense and FICA taxes as a result of the increased compensation expense.
Both occupancy and equipment expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased depreciation expense driven by a full year's depreciation expense on the post-acquisition retained facilities, the closure of legacy branch facilities and increased software amortization. Marketing expense for 2021 increased by 10% compared to 2020 as a result of increased advertising initiatives during the current year. Outside data services expense increased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the increased cost of contractual services with volume-based components. FDIC insurance expense decreased 9% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a reduction in the risk factors applied by the regulatory agency in the determination of the Company's premium. Amortization of intangibles increased from the prior year as a result of the inclusion of a full year's amortization of the various intangible assets recognized as part of the RPJ and Revere acquisitions. The 30% increase in professional fees and services is directly associated with the Company's strategic investments in technology for greater efficiency and data management. The loss on the redemption of the FHLB advances was the result of the early prepayment.
2020 vs. 2019
Non-interest expenses increased $76.7 million to $255.8 million in 2020 compared to $179.1 million in 2019. The operational impact of the Revere and RPJ acquisitions was included in 2020, in addition to $25.2 million in merger and acquisition expense compared to $1.9 million for 2019, and the $5.9 million loss on early redemption of acquired FHLB advances. The loss on the redemption was offset by the accelerated amortization of the purchase premium on the acquired FHLB advances, which is included in net interest
income. Excluding merger and acquisition expense and the loss on the FHLB redemption, non-interest expense rose 26%, primarily as a result operational costs associated with the Revere acquisition.
Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased 29% in 2020 due principally to increased salary expense derived from the two acquisitions, commissions associated with the significant level of mortgage loan originations and incentive payments based on the achievement of volume or revenue targets. The average number of full-time equivalent employees increased to 1,080 in 2020 compared to 913 for 2019. Benefit expense increased 19% during 2020 due to an increase in the matching contribution expense for the employee 401(k) plan and FICA taxes on salaries, both as a result of the increased number of employees during 2020, in addition to increases in various other employee benefit programs.
Both occupancy and equipment expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in rental and depreciation expense driven by the additional facilities from the Revere and RPJ acquisitions. This increase was net of the impact of the Company's consolidation of six redundant branches during the second half of 2020 as a result of the Revere acquisition. Equipment expenses also increased in 2020 compared to 2019, due to an increase in software costs. Marketing expense for 2020 decreased by 4% compared to 2019 as a result of decreased advertising initiatives. Outside data services expense increased 16% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the increased cost of contractual services with volume-based components, in addition to the necessity of maintaining both the Company's and Revere's data systems for a portion of 2020 until the systems were fully integrated. FDIC insurance expense increased 109% in 2020 compared to 2019 as the result of the assessment credit received during 2019 due to the industry deposit insurance fund reaching a stipulated benchmark level. Merger and acquisition expense associated with the Revere acquisition totaled $25.2 million in 2020 compared to merger and acquisition expense of $1.9 million in 2019. Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2020 from 2019 as a result of the increase in the various intangible assets recognized as part of the Revere and RPJ acquisitions. The loss on the redemption of the FHLB advances was the result of the prepayment of the acquired advances. This loss was offset by the accelerated amortization of the $5.9 million purchase premium associated with those acquired advances and was is included in net interest income. The remaining other non-interest expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by the reserve for lending commitments, processing costs and legacy branch closing costs.
Income Taxes
The Company’s income tax expense in 2021 was $76.6 million, compared to $27.5 million in 2020 and $36.4 million in 2019. The resulting effective rates for each year were 24.6% for 2021, 22.1% for 2020 and 23.8% for 2019. The increase in the effective rate in 2021 was due to the 2020 application of a change in tax laws that expanded the time permitted to utilize previous net operating losses. The Company applied this change in the prior year to utilize the net operating losses acquired as part of the 2018 WashingtonFirst acquisition to realize a tax benefit of $1.8 million.
Operating Expense Performance
Management views the GAAP efficiency ratio as an important financial measure of expense performance and cost management. The ratio expresses the level of non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue (net interest income plus total non-interest income). Lower ratios indicate improved productivity.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company also uses a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations. Management believes that its traditional ratio better focuses attention on the operating performance of the Company over time than does a GAAP ratio, and is highly useful in comparing period-to-period operating performance of the Company’s core business operations. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non-interest expenses. However, this measure is supplemental, and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on GAAP measures. The reader is cautioned that the non-GAAP efficiency ratio used by the Company may not be comparable to GAAP or non-GAAP efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions.
In general, the efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non-interest income. Non-interest expenses used in the calculation of the non-GAAP efficiency ratio exclude merger and acquisition expense, the amortization of intangible assets, and other non-recurring expenses, such as early prepayment penalties on FHLB advances. Income for the non-GAAP ratio includes the favorable effect of tax-exempt income, and excludes realized investment securities gains and losses, which may vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses, and non-recurring gains. The measure is different from the GAAP efficiency ratio, which also is presented in this report. The GAAP measure is calculated using non-interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The GAAP and non-GAAP efficiency ratios are
reconciled and provided in the following table. The GAAP efficiency ratio was 49.47% in 2021 compared to 54.90% for the prior year. This improvement in the efficiency ratio is the result of the 13% growth in revenues exceeding the 2% growth in non-interest expense during the current year. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 46.17% in 2021, compared to 46.53% in the prior year, as a result of the 13% growth in non-GAAP revenue exceeding the 12% growth in non-GAAP non-interest expense.
The Company has also presented core earnings, core earnings per diluted share, core return on average assets and core return on average tangible common equity in order to present metrics that are more comparable to prior periods to provide an indication of the core performance of the Company year-over-year. Core earnings reflect net income exclusive of the provision/(credit) for credit losses, provision/(credit) for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, merger and acquisition expense, amortization of intangible assets, loss on FHLB redemptions and investment securities gains, in each case net of tax. Average tangible common equity represents average stockholders’ equity adjusted for average goodwill and average intangible assets, net.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
GAAP and Non-GAAP Performance Ratios
(1)Tax adjustments have been adjusted using the combined marginal federal and state rate of 25.64% for 2021, 25.54% both 2020, 26.13% for both 2019 and 2018, and 39.55% for 2017.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The Company’s total assets decreased 2% to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $12.8 billion at December 31, 2020. During the year, excess liquidity resulting from deposit growth and PPP loan forgiveness was used to reduce borrowings as well as fund the loan growth that occurred in the fourth quarter of the current year.
Total loans at December 31, 2021 were $10.0 billion compared to $10.4 billion at December 31, 2020. At year-end 2021, investment securities had increased 7% to $1.5 billion compared to year end 2020. At December 31, 2021, total deposits were $10.6 billion compared to $10.0 billion at the end of 2020, a 6% increase during the period. Total borrowings were $313.8 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020.
Loans
A comparison of the loan portfolio for the years indicated is presented in the following table:
Total loans declined by 4% to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $10.4 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the reduction of $874.4 million in PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, total loans at December 31, 2021 grew 5% to $9.8 billion as compared to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2020, as the commercial loan portfolio grew $681.1 million, while the residential mortgage and consumer loans declined $255.1 million due to run-off. The growth in the commercial portfolio, excluding PPP loans, occurred in all commercial portfolios led by the $506.6 million or 14% growth in the investor real estate commercial portfolio. The year-over-year decline in the mortgage loan portfolio resulted from the continuing sale of a majority of new mortgage loan production. In the second half of 2021, the Company generated $2.1 billion in new gross loan production of which $1.5 billion was funded, which more than offset $873.8 million in commercial loan run-off.
Loan Balances by Industry
Loan balances by industry for specific lending portfolios are presented in the following table:
Loan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity
Loan maturities and interest rate characteristics for loan portfolios are presented in the following table:
Composition of Investment Securities
The composition of investment securities for the periods indicated is presented in the following table:
(1)At estimated fair value.
(2)Issued by a U.S. Government Agency or secured by U.S. Government Agency collateral.
(3)The outstanding balance of no single issuer, except for U.S. Government Agency securities, exceeded ten percent of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
The investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Agency securities, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and state and municipal securities. As the portfolio grew 7% during 2021, the composition of the portfolio migrated away from state and municipal securities with longer terms to shorter term U.S. treasuries and government agencies securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities to provide for greater reinvestment opportunities in anticipation of rising interest rates in 2022. In addition, floating term securities were also reduced to due to low yields and LIBOR indexes. As a result of the strategic migration, at December 31, 2021, mortgage and asset-backed securities comprised 71% of the investment portfolio compared to 64% at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021, 96% of the investment portfolio was invested in Aa/AA or Aaa/AAA rated securities compared to 93% at December 31, 2020. The average duration of the investment portfolio was 4.3 years compared to 4.2 years at the end of the prior year. The composition and duration of the investment portfolio has resulted in a portfolio with low credit risk that is expected to provide the liquidity needed to meet lending and other funding demands. The portfolio is monitored on a continual basis with consideration given to interest rate trends and the structure of the yield curve and with constant assessment of economic projections and analysis.
Other Earning Assets
Residential mortgage loans held for sale decreased to $39.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $78.3 million as of December 31, 2020, due to the decrease in volume of originations as residential lending rates rose during the year and the decision to hold a larger percentage of production on the balance sheet to provide for renewed growth of the residential mortgage portfolio. Interest-bearing deposits with banks increased by $151.0 million to $354.1 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $203.1 million at December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the cash received from the forgiveness of PPP loans.
Deposits
The composition of deposits for the periods indicated is presented in the following table:
Deposits and Borrowings
Total deposits at December 31, 2021 were $10.6 billion compared to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2020, a 6% increase during the period. This growth was driven principally from impact of the PPP program and the growth in transaction relationships, while time deposits declined $366.8 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio declined to 94% at the end of 2021 compared to 104% the end of 2020 as a result of the balance sheet impact from PPP forgiveness as loans declined and deposits grew during the period. The deposit increase from year-end 2020 was driven primarily by increases of 14% in non-interest bearing demand, 24% in interest-bearing demand and 28% in regular savings categories, which more than offset the 22% decline in time deposits. A large portion of the demand deposit growth is the result of the funds from the PPP program, which were placed in deposit accounts at the Bank. A large portion of the liquidity from the deposit of PPP funds into accounts at the Bank provided funding for the complete liquidation of federal funds purchased and FHLB advances and the reduction of brokered time deposits during 2021 and resulted in lower interest expense during the year. At December 31, 2021, interest-bearing deposits represented 64% of total deposits with the remaining 36% in noninterest-bearing balances. At December 31, 2020, interest-bearing deposits represented 67% of total deposits, while non-interest bearing deposits represented 33%.
The total amount of deposits that exceeded the $250,000 insured limit provided by the FDIC was approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021. This estimate is based on the determination of known deposit account relationships of each depositor and the insurance guidelines provided by the FDIC.
Total borrowings decreased 73% at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The primary cause of the year-over-year decrease in borrowings was driven by the previously mentioned reduction of federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. In addition, further reductions occurred in borrowings during 2021 as a result of full redemption of subordinated debt that was assumed in the Revere and WashingtonFirst acquisitions.
Capital Management
Management monitors historical and projected earnings, dividends and asset growth, as well as risks associated with the various types of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities, in order to determine appropriate capital levels. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 remained at $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2020. During 2021, the net growth in capital from earnings, net of dividends, was significantly offset by the Company's repurchase of 2,350,000 shares of common stock resulting in a $107.3 million reduction in stockholders’ equity. The ratio of average equity to average assets was 11.85% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 11.38% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Risk-Based Capital Ratios
Bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain capital ratios in accordance with guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulators. These guidelines are commonly known as Risk-Based Capital guidelines. The actual regulatory ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy are summarized for the Company in the following table.
Regulatory capital at December 31, 2021 was comprised of Tier 1 capital of $1.1 billion and total qualifying capital of $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the most recent notification from the Bank’s primary regulator categorized the Bank as a "well-capitalized" institution under the prompt corrective action rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Designation as a well-capitalized institution under these regulations is not a recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the Bank by federal bank regulators.
The minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are: (1) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%; (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (3) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; and (4) a total capital ratio of 8%. Covered financial institutions must also maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
The main drivers of the in the improvement in the ratios at December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020 were the 2021 earnings, net of the repurchase program impact, coupled with the reduction in risk-weighted assets. During the year, the Company continued to elect to apply the provisions of the CECL deferral transition in the determination of its risk-based capital ratios. At December 31, 2021, the impact of the application of this deferral transition provided an additional $11.5 million in Tier 1 capital compared to $22.5 million at December 31, 2020, and resulted in raising the common equity Tier 1 ratio by 12 and 22 basis points, respectively.
Tangible Common Equity
Tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude the balances of goodwill and other intangible assets from total stockholders’ equity and total assets. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides information to investors that may be useful in understanding the Company's financial condition. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies.
Tangible common equity remained at $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 9.21% compared to 8.61% at December 31, 2020. The increase in tangible common equity in 2021 from 2020 was primarily the result of the 2% decrease in tangible assets and the 5% growth in tangible common equity, net of the impact of the Company's stock repurchase program. Excluding PPP loans from tangible assets at December 31, 2021, the tangible common equity ratio would be 9.35%.
Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity Ratios
A reconciliation of the non-GAAP ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are provided in the following table.
Credit Risk
The fundamental lending business of the Company is based on understanding, measuring and controlling the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company’s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk entails both general risks, which are inherent in the process of lending, and risk specific to individual borrowers. The Company’s credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to any single customer, industry or collateral type. Typically, each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit losses based on historical loss experience. Residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience. Loans secured by personal property, such as auto loans, generally experience medium credit losses. Unsecured loan products, such as personal revolving credit, have the highest credit loss experience and, for that reason, the Company has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending. Credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly, as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions. Generally, improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers, enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements. Improvements, if any, in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times. Inconsistent economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial customers, reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations.
Loans acquired as a part of an acquisition transaction that have evidence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since their origination are considered “purchased credit deteriorated” or “PCD” loans and are recorded at their initial fair values as of the acquisition date. The identification of loans that have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since their origination requires judgment and an assessment of a number of factors. For further discussion regarding the acquired loans, including PCD loans, refer to that section of Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
To control and manage credit risk, management has a credit process in place to reasonably ensure that credit standards are maintained along with an in-house loan administration, accompanied by oversight and review procedures. The primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks and involves the analysis of the borrower’s ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral. Oversight and review procedures include monitoring the credit quality of the portfolio, providing early identification of potential problem credits and proactive management of problem credits.
The Company recognizes a lending relationship as non-performing when either the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or as a result of factors, such as bankruptcy, interruption of cash flows, etc., considered at the monthly credit committee meeting. Classification as a non-accrual loan is based on a determination that the Company may not collect all principal and/or interest payments according to
contractual terms. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed from interest income. Typically, all payments received on non-accrual loans are first applied to the remaining principal balance of the loans. Any additional recoveries are credited to the allowance up to the amount of all previous charge-offs.
The level of non-performing loans to total loans decreased to 0.49% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2020. Non-performing loans were $48.8 million at December 31, 2021 in comparison to $115.5 million at December 31, 2020. The reduction in non-performing loans over the prior year was driven by partial payoffs and eventual charge-offs of a few large borrowings within the hospitality sector with an aggregate balance of $32.9 million. These large relationships were collateral dependent and required no individual reserves due to sufficient values of their underlying collateral. Charged-off amounts of these credits did not exceed their associated established individual reserves. During 2021, non-accrual commercial business loans decreased $14.5 million, while non-accrual commercial real estate loans decreased $49.4 million. Combined residential and consumer non-accrual lending portfolio declined $2.4 million. These decreases were driven by net payments of $61.2 million during the current year.
While the diversification of the lending portfolio among different commercial, residential and consumer product lines along with different market conditions of the D.C. suburbs, Northern Virginia and Baltimore metropolitan area has mitigated some of the risks in the portfolio, local economic conditions and levels of non-performing loans may continue to be influenced by the conditions being experienced in various business sectors of the economy on both a regional and national level. As noted, risks, uncertainties and various other factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic include the potential impact on the economy and the businesses of the Company's borrowers and their ability to remit contractual payments on their obligations to the Company in a timely manner. The current ability to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by the government on the economic well-being of the Company's borrowers and the manifestations of all these factors including the future performance aspect of the credit portfolio remains uncertain.
The Company’s methodology for evaluating whether a loan shall be placed on non-accrual status begins with risk-rating credits on an individual basis and includes consideration of the borrower’s overall financial condition, payment record and available cash resources that may include the sufficiency of collateral value and, in a select few cases, verifiable support from financial guarantors. In measuring a specific allowance, the Company looks primarily to the value of the collateral (adjusted for estimated costs to sell) or projected cash flows generated by the operation of the collateral as the primary sources of repayment of the loan. The Company may consider the existence of guarantees and the financial strength and wherewithal of the guarantors involved in any loan relationship. Guarantees may be considered as a source of repayment based on the guarantor’s financial condition and payment capacity. Accordingly, absent a verifiable payment capacity, a guarantee alone would not be sufficient to avoid classifying the loan as non-accrual.
Management has established a credit process that dictates that structured procedures be performed to monitor these loans between the receipt of an original appraisal and the updated appraisal. These procedures include the following:
•An internal evaluation is updated periodically to include borrower financial statements and/or cash flow projections.
•The borrower may be contacted for a meeting to discuss an updated or revised action plan which may include a request for additional collateral.
•Re-verification of the documentation supporting the Company’s position with respect to the collateral securing the loan.
•At the monthly credit committee meeting the loan may be downgraded and an individual allowance may be decided upon in advance of the receipt of the appraisal.
•Upon receipt of the updated appraisal (or based on an updated internal financial evaluation) the loan balance is compared to the appraisal and an individual allowance is decided upon for the particular loan, typically for the amount of the difference between the appraised value (adjusted for estimated costs to sell) and the loan balance.
•Evaluation of whether adverse changes in the value of the collateral are expected over the remainder of the loan’s expected life.
•The Company will individually assess the allowance for credit losses based on the fair value of the collateral for any collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty or when the Company determines that the foreclosure is probable. The Company will charge-off the excess of the loan amount over the fair value of the collateral adjusted for the estimated selling costs.
Loans considered to be troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are loans that have their terms restructured (e.g., interest rates, loan maturity date, payment and amortization period, etc.) in circumstances that provide payment relief to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. All restructured collateral-dependent loans are individually assessed for allowance for credit losses and may either
be in accruing or non-accruing status. Non-accruing restructured loans may return to accruing status provided doubt has been removed concerning the collectability of principal and interest as evidenced by a sufficient period of payment performance in accordance with the restructured terms. Loans may be removed from the restructured category if the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty, a re-underwriting event took place and the revised loan terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement are considered to be consistent with terms that can be obtained in the credit market for loans with comparable risk.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act, which was signed into law in March 2020, provided financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act provided for extensions of up to 180 days in the delay of loan principal and/or interest payments for customers who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These customers must meet certain criteria, such as they were in good standing and not more than 30 days past due prior to the pandemic, as well as other requirements noted in regulatory guidance. In some cases, customers received a second and third accommodation. The initial period to request payment accommodation expired on December 31, 2020. However, the Consolidation Appropriations Act, which amended CARES Act, extended the expiration date to January 1, 2022. Based on regulatory guidance, the Company did not classify the temporary COVID-19 loan modifications as TDRs, nor were the customers considered past due with regards to their deferred payments. Upon exiting the loan modification deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency reverted to the provisions in effect prior to entry into the program.
At the height of and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company developed a set of guidelines to provide relief to qualified commercial, mortgage and consumer loans customers. These guidelines provided for deferment of certain loan payments of up to 180 days. Initial deferrals of 90 days were granted to qualified customers with the option to request further deferrals, each for an additional 90 days. Ultimately, since the inception of the deferral program, the Company granted payment modifications/deferrals on over 2,500 loans with an aggregate balance of $2.1 billion. At December 31, 2021, 38 loans with an aggregate balance of $7.6 million remain in deferral status. Currently, the vast majority of loans that had been granted modifications/deferrals have returned to their original payment plans without a significant impact on payment delinquencies.
The Company approved and funded over 8,500 PPP loans for a total of $1.6 billion during 2020 and 2021. Loans originated under the program are 100% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. In the latter part of 2020, the Company began accepting digital PPP forgiveness applications. At December 31, 2021, loans totaling $1.4 billion have been forgiven and an additional $52.0 million have been repaid by borrowers.
The Company may extend the maturity of a performing or current loan that may have some inherent weakness associated with the loan. However, the Company generally follows a policy of not extending maturities on non-performing loans under existing terms. Maturity date extensions only occur under revised terms that clearly place the Company in a position to increase the likelihood of or assure full collection of the loan under the contractual terms and/or terms at the time of the extension that may eliminate or mitigate the inherent weakness in the loan. These terms may incorporate, but are not limited to additional assignment of collateral, significant balance curtailments/liquidations and assignments of additional project cash flows. Guarantees may be a consideration in the extension of loan maturities. As a general matter, the Company does not view the extension of a loan to be a satisfactory approach to resolving non-performing credits. On an exception basis, certain performing loans that have displayed some inherent weakness in the underlying collateral values, an inability to comply with certain loan covenants which are not affecting the performance of the credit or other identified weakness may be extended.
The Company typically sells a portion of its fixed-rate residential mortgage originations in the secondary mortgage market. Concurrent with such sales, the Company is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The related sale agreements grant the purchasers recourse back to the Company, which could require the Company to repurchase loans or to share in any losses incurred by the purchasers. This recourse exposure typically extends for a period of nine to eighteen months after the sale of the loan although the time frame for repurchase requests can extend for an indefinite period. Such transactions could be due to a number of causes including borrower fraud or early payment default. The Company has seen a very limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers for such events and routinely monitors its exposure in this regard. The Company maintains a liability of $0.5 million for probable losses due to repurchases. The Company believes that this reserve is appropriate.
Mortgage loan servicing rights are accounted for at amortized cost and are monitored for impairment on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2021, the amortized cost of the Company's mortgage loan servicing rights was $0.4 million compared to $0.6 million at December 31, 2020. The decline in the year-over-year balance was the result of the loan pay-offs. The Company did not incur any impairment losses during 2021.
The Company may periodically engage in whole loan sale transactions of its residential mortgage loans as a part its interest rate risk management strategy. The Company did not engage in any whole loan sales during 2021.
Analysis of Credit Risk
The following table presents information with respect to non-accrual loans, 90-day past due delinquencies and non-performing assets for the years indicated:
(1)Gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2021 if non-accrual loans shown above had been current and in accordance with their original terms was $5.1 million. No interest income was accrued on these loans during the year while on non-accrual status. Please see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policy for placing loans on non-accrual status.
(2)Performing loans considered potential problem loans, as defined and identified by management, amounted to $22.1 million at December 31, 2021. Although these are loans where known information about the borrowers' possible credit problems causes management to have concerns as to the borrowers' ability to comply with the loan repayment terms, most are current as to payment terms, well collateralized and are not believed to present significant risk of loss. Loans classified for regulatory purposes not included in either non-performing or potential problem loans consist only of "other loans especially mentioned" and do not, in management's opinion, represent or result from trends or uncertainties reasonably expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources, or represent material credits where known information about the borrowers' possible credit problems causes management to have doubts as to the borrowers' ability to comply with the loan repayment terms.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of the portion of the Company’s loans’ amortized cost basis not expected to be collected over the loans’ contractual life. As a part of the credit oversight and review process, the Company maintains an allowance for credit losses (the “allowance”). The following allowance section should be read in conjunction with the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the measurement of the allowance as the Company has a non-accrual policy to reverse any accrued, uncollected interest income when loans are placed on non-accrual status.
The appropriateness of the allowance is determined through ongoing evaluation of the credit portfolio, and involves consideration of a number of factors. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and assumptions, including consideration of current conditions and economic forecasts, which may be susceptible to significant volatility. The forecasted economic metrics with the greatest impact in order of magnitude were the expected level of business bankruptcies, the expected future unemployment rate and, to a lesser degree, the house price index. The most sensitive assumptions include the length of the forecast and reversion periods, forecast of economic variables and prepayment and curtailment speeds. The amount of expected losses can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries are credited to the allowance when received. Management adjusts the level of the allowance through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The provision for credit losses was a credit of $45.6 million in 2021 and a charge of $85.7 million in 2020. During the current year, the credit for the provision for credit losses, compared to the prior year's charge to the provision, reflects the impact of the continued improvement in forecasted economic metrics, notably the rate of unemployment, anticipated business bankruptcies and the housing price index. These decreases were partially offset by the significant loan growth that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021 and qualitative factors applied in the determination of the allowance. The portion of the current year's $45.6 million credit to the provision that was the related to the improvement in the economic forecasts amounted to approximately $67.0 million, which was partially offset by the adjustments to qualitative factors related to the Company's exposure to certain higher risk industries in the total amount of approximately $19.6 million. The charge to the provision for credit losses for the same period in 2020 predominantly reflected the combined results of the impact of the deteriorated economic forecasts during the first half of 2020 by the negative projected impact of COVID-19 and the initial allowance recognized on acquired Revere non-purchased credit deteriorated loans. The portion of the $85.7 million provision for 2020 directly attributable to the significant deterioration in the economic forecast amounted to approximately $44.1 million. In addition, the initial allowance for credit losses on Revere’s acquired non-PCD loans was recognized through provision for credit losses in the amount of $17.5 million. The remainder of the 2020 provision reflected the impact of changes in interest rates, existing terms, qualitative factors, portfolio composition and portfolio maturities. The acquisition of Revere’s PCD loans resulted in an initial increase to the allowance for credit losses of $18.6 million, which did not affect the provision expense for 2020.
At December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses was $109.1 million as compared to $165.4 million at December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans was 1.10% and 1.59% at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represented 224% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2021 as compared to 143% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 the allowance attributable to the commercial portfolio represented 1.20% of total commercial loans while the portion attributable to total combined consumer and mortgage loans was 0.55%, compared to 1.70% and 1.05%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. At the end of the current year, with respect to the total commercial portion of the allowance, 45% of this portion is allocated to the investor real estate loan portfolio, resulting in the ratio of the allowance for investor real estate loans to total investor real estate loans of 1.09%. A similar ratio with respect to AD&C loans was 1.87% and 1.56% for commercial business loans at the end of the current year. Excluding the PPP loans, which do not have an associated allowance, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding would be 1.12% and the ratio of the allowance for commercial business loans to total commercial business loans would be 1.78%.
The current methodology for assessing the appropriate allowance includes: (1) a collective quantified reserve that reflects the Company’s historical default and loss experience adjusted for expected economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period and the Company’s prepayment and curtailment rates, (2) collective qualitative factors that consider the expected impact of certain qualitative factors not fully captured in the collective quantitative reserve, including concentrations of the loan portfolio, expected changes to the economic forecasts, large lending relationships, early delinquencies, and factors related to credit
administration, including, among others, loan-to-value ratios, borrowers’ risk rating and credit score migrations, and (3) individual allowances on collateral-dependent loans where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or where the Company determined that foreclosure is probable. Under the current methodology, the impact of the utilization of the historical default and loss experience results in 57% of the total allowance being attributable to the historical performance of the portfolio while 43% of the allowance is attributable to the collective qualitative factors applied to determine the allowance at December 31, 2021. At the end of the previous year, the utilization of the historical default and loss experience resulted in 84% of the total allowance being attributable to the historical performance of the portfolio while 16% of the allowance was attributable to the collective qualitative factors applied to determine the allowance. The decrease in the quantitative allocation of the allowance during the current year is a direct result of the continued improvement in the forecasted economic metrics, predominantly the projected decline in unemployment rate, applied in the determination of the allowance. The increase in the qualitative allocation of the allowance was the result of increased consideration of expected losses due to the concentration of portfolio risk in certain industries, in addition to the potential economic impact of a recession in the future.
The quantified collective portion of the allowance is determined by pooling loans into segments based on the similar risk characteristics of the underlying borrowers, in addition to consideration of collateral type, industry and business purpose of the loans. The Company selected two collective methodologies, the discounted cash flows and weighted average remaining life methodologies. Segments utilizing the discounted cash flow method are further sub-segmented based on the risk level (determined either by internal risk ratings or Beacon Scores). Collective calculation methodologies use the Company’s historical default and loss experience adjusted for economic forecasts. The reasonable and supportable forecast period represents a two year economic outlook for the applicable economic variables. Following the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period expected losses revert back to the historical mean over the next two years on a straight-line basis.
Economic variables which have the most significant impact on the allowance include:
•unemployment rate;
•number of business bankruptcies; and
•house price index.
The collective quantified component of the allowance is supplemented by a qualitative component to address various risk characteristics of the Company’s loan portfolio including:
•trends in early delinquencies;
•changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio;
•concentrations of loans to specific industry segments;
•expected changes in economic conditions;
•changes in the Company’s credit administration and loan portfolio management processes; and
•the quality of the Company’s credit risk identification processes.
The individual reserve assessment is applied to collateral dependent loans where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the Company determined that foreclosure is probable. The determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on whether a repayment of the loan is expected to be from the sale or the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected from the operation of the collateral, the Company uses the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral as the fair value. When repayment of the loan is expected from the sale of the collateral the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or the appraised value less estimated cost to sell. During the individual reserve assessment, management also considers the potential future changes in the value of the collateral over the remainder of the loan’s life. The balance of collateral-dependent loans individually assessed for the allowance was $33.5 million, with individual allowances of $6.6 million against those loans at December 31, 2021.
If an updated appraisal is received subsequent to the preliminary determination of an individual allowance or partial charge-off, and it is less than the initial appraisal used in the initial assessment, an additional individual allowance or charge-off is taken on the related credit. Partially charged-off loans are not written back up based on updated appraisals and always remain on non-accrual with any and all subsequent payments first applied to the remaining balance of the loan as principal reductions. No interest income is recognized on loans that have been partially charged-off.
A current appraisal on large loans is usually obtained if the appraisal on file is more than 12 months old and there has been a material change in market conditions, zoning, physical use or the appropriateness of the collateral based on an internal evaluation. The Company’s policy is to strictly adhere to regulatory appraisal standards. If an appraisal is ordered, no more than a 30 day turnaround is requested from the appraiser, who is selected by Credit Administration from an approved appraiser list. After receipt of the updated appraisal, the assigned credit officer will recommend to the Chief Credit Officer whether an individual allowance or a charge-off should be taken. The Chief Credit Officer has the authority to approve an individual allowance or charge-off between monthly credit committee meetings to ensure that there are no significant time lapses during this process. The Company's borrowers are concentrated in nine counties in Maryland, three counties in Virginia and in Washington D.C. Excluding the PPP loans, commercial and residential mortgages, including home equity loans and lines, represented 86% of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 88% of total loans at December 31, 2020. Certain loan terms may create concentrations of credit risk and increase the Company’s exposure to loss. These include terms that permit the deferral of principal payments or payments that are smaller than normal interest accruals (negative amortization); loans with high loan-to-value ratios; loans, such as option adjustable-rate mortgages, that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments that are in excess of increases that would result solely from increases in market interest rates; and interest-only loans. The Company does not make loans that provide for negative amortization or option adjustable-rate mortgages.
The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio as of each period end. The allowance is allocated in the following table to various loan categories based on the methodology used to estimate credit losses; however, the allocation does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan category.
Summary of Credit Loss Experience
The following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated:
Market Risk Management
The Company's net income is largely dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity.
The Company’s interest rate risk management goals are (1) to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets, and (2) to minimize fluctuations in net interest income as a percentage of interest-earning assets. Management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of
floating-rate assets; by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched; by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits; and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis.
The Company’s board of directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by management’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”). The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or “EVE” at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S. Treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years. The Company measures the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optional factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors embedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the Company. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. As an example, certain money market deposit accounts are assumed to reprice at 40% to 100% of the interest rate change in each of the up rate shock scenarios even though this is not a contractual requirement. As a practical matter, management would likely lag the impact of any upward movement in market rates on these accounts as a mechanism to manage the Bank’s net interest margin. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers’ ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan, lease, and deposit products.
The Company prepares a current base case and eight alternative simulations at least once per quarter and reports the analysis to the board of directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts are produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate. The statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Projected interest rates are shocked by +/- 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points (“bp”), although the Company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment. It is management’s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.
The Company augments its quarterly interest rate shock analysis with alternative external interest rate scenarios on a monthly basis. These alternative interest rate scenarios may include non-parallel rate ramps and non-parallel yield curve twists. If a measure of risk produced by the alternative simulations of the entire statement of condition violates policy guidelines, ALCO is required to develop a plan to restore the measure of risk to a level that complies with policy limits within two quarters.
Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution’s short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.
As shown above, measures of net interest income at risk at December 31, 2021 had declined in every rising interest rate change scenario from December 31, 2020. All measures remained well within prescribed policy limits. As indicated in the table, in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income sensitivity increased compared to the prior year-end as a result of the increase in asset sensitivity. This increase was driven by the combined impact of an increase in interest-bearing deposits at banks and the significant reduction in borrowings at December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year end.
The measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company’s cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company's net assets.
Overall, the measure of the economic value of equity ("EVE") at risk remained relatively stable from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The stability of EVE through all interest rate scenarios was the result of the positive impact from the growth in demand deposits, increased money market savings accounts and the significant reductions in borrowings being substantially mitigated by the growth in fixed rate loan portfolio and a reduction in the variable rate loan portfolio.
LIBOR Transition
The Company has certain loans, interest rate swap agreements and debt obligations whose interest rates are indexed to the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On March 5, 2021, LIBOR’s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited, announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities will cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In response to this timing, the Company has ceased utilizing LIBOR in the pricing of its offered credit products as of December 31, 2021. The Company has updated its systems and is able to offer products that utilize SOFR, AMERIBOR and other alternative reference rates. At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 1,200 loans totaling $1.6 billion indexed to LIBOR that will mature after June 30, 2023, of which 844 loans totaling $468.2 million are adjustable-rate mortgage loans. The Company is developing communication and transition plans to convert its LIBOR-based loans to alternative reference rates.
The Company currently has $175.0 million in fixed to floating rate subordinated debenture notes that bear a fixed rate through November 14, 2024. Beginning November 15, 2024, the interest rate was to shift to a floating rate based on three-month LIBOR plus 262 basis points through the remaining maturity or early redemption of the notes. The note indenture contains robust fallback language that allows for an appropriate alternative benchmark rate to be applied to determine the overall interest rate on the notes.
Liquidity Management
Liquidity is measured by a financial institution's ability to raise funds through loan repayments, maturing investments, deposit growth, borrowed funds, capital and the sale of highly marketable assets such as investment securities and residential mortgage loans. The Company's liquidity position, considering both internal and external sources available, exceeded anticipated short-term and long-term needs at December 31, 2021. Management considers core deposits, defined to include all deposits other than brokered and outsourced deposits and certain time deposits of $250 thousand or more, to be a relatively stable funding source. Core deposits equaled 85% of total interest-earning assets at December 31, 2021. In addition, loan payments, maturities, calls and pay downs of securities, deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements. In assessing liquidity, management considers operating requirements, the seasonality of deposit flows, investment, loan and deposit maturities and calls, expected funding of loans and deposit withdrawals, and the market values of available-for-sale investments, so that sufficient funds are available on short notice to meet obligations as they arise and to ensure that the Company is able to pursue new business opportunities.
In addition to factors discussed above that can affect liquidity, the Company’s growth, mortgage banking activities and changes in the liquidity of the investment portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates are also taken into consideration. Under this approach, implemented by the Funds Management Subcommittee of ALCO under formal policy guidelines, the Company’s liquidity position is measured weekly, looking forward at thirty day intervals from 30 to 360 days. The measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position, along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth. Resulting projections as of December 31, 2021, provides an indication of liquidity versus requirements that the Company utilizes to determine how it will fund loans and other earning assets.
The Company has external sources of funds that can be drawn upon when required. The main sources of external liquidity are available lines of credit with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank. Based on pledged collateral, the available line of credit with the FHLB totaled $3.9 billion with no outstanding borrowings against it as of December 31, 2021. The Company also had secured lines of credit available from the Federal Reserve Bank and correspondent banks of $509.4 million at December 31, 2021 collateralized by portfolio loans. In addition, the Company had unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021
with no outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit. Based upon its liquidity analysis, including external sources of liquidity available, management believes the liquidity position was appropriate at December 31, 2021.
Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., as a standalone entity (“Bancorp”) is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, Bancorp is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its common stockholders and interest and principal on outstanding debt. Bancorp’s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to Bancorp in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. Based on this requirement, as of December 31, 2021, the Bank could have declared a dividend of $126.6 million to Bancorp. At December 31, 2021, Bancorp had liquid assets of $69.0 million.
The Company has various contractual obligations that affect its cash flows and liquidity. For information regarding material contractual obligations, please see Market Risk Management previously discussed, and Note 7 - Premises and Equipment, Note 8 - Leases, Note 11 - Borrowings, Note 14 - Pension, Profit Sharing and Other Employee Benefit Plans, Note 19 - Derivatives, Note 20 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk, and Note 22 - Fair Value in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
With the exception of the Company’s obligations in connection with its irrevocable letters of credit and loan commitments, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, that is material to investors. Arrangements to fund credit products or guarantee financing take the form of loan commitments (including lines of credit on revolving credit structures) and letters of credit. Approval for these arrangements are obtained in the same manner as loans. Generally, cash flows, collateral value and risk assessments are considered when determining the amount and structure of credit arrangements. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to provide financing to a customer with the provision that there are no violations of any condition established in the agreement. Commitments generally have interest rates determined by current market rates, expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit typically represent unused portions of lines of credit that were provided and remain available as long as customers comply with the requisite contractual conditions. Commitments to extend credit are evaluated, processed and/or renewed regularly on a case by case basis, as part of the credit management process. The total commitment amount or line of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as it is highly unlikely that all customers would draw on their lines of credit in full at one time. For additional information on off-balance sheet arrangements, please see Note 20 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Note 11 - Borrowings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Capital Management above.
