Item 7.	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8. Management's Discussion and Analysis comparing the results for the year ended January 2, 2021, to the results for the year ended December 28, 2019 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2021, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2021, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the comparisons which follow, the year ended January 1, 2022 consisted of 52 weeks, whereas the year ended January 2, 2021 consisted of 53 weeks. We believe the effect of the extra week in our 2020 fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 was immaterial and does not impact the comparability of our results of operations for the year ended January 1, 2022 to the year ended January 2, 2021.
Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:
•Impact of COVID 19 on our Business;
•Executive Overview;
•Results of Operations;
•Liquidity and Capital Resources;
•Critical Accounting Estimates;
•Recently Issued Accounting Standards; and
•Forward Outlook
IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR BUSINESS
During March 2020, a global pandemic (the “Pandemic”) was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”). The Pandemic has resulted in a significant number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths in several of our key markets, including Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. The Pandemic has significantly affected economic conditions in those markets, and in the United States in general, and internationally, including due to federal, state and local governments and employers reacting to the public health crisis with mitigation measures, and also due to the general fear and uncertainty created by the Pandemic, all of which has resulted in workforce, supply chain and production disruptions, along with reduced demand and spending in many industries and markets. Although many of the government-mandated restrictions on economic and social activities that were put in place as part of the initial response to the Pandemic have been lifted, and vaccines with high degrees of efficacy have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, it is still uncertain when or if the nation-wide program of vaccination will result in herd immunity to COVID-19 in the United States or globally. This uncertainty is being impacted by several factors, including vaccine hesitancy or resistance, and the emergence of the highly-contagious strains of COVID-19 known as the Delta and Omicron variants. As a result, it is still currently unclear when, or if, social, business, occupational, educational and economic conditions will return to pre-Pandemic conditions.
Our first priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families and the communities in which we operate, and as COVID-19 gained a foothold in the Southeast Florida area, we took swift action to protect our employees by temporarily suspending operations at and fumigating our Miami and Hialeah, Florida facilities, each for one-week periods in April 2020. We also took that step at our Western Windows Systems facility in Phoenix, Arizona during July 2020. All of our manufacturing locations are operational and have been deemed essential under various government orders. Each of our facilities has implemented policies and procedures designed to protect the health and safety of our team members in light of the Pandemic, including: 1) continuing to monitor guidelines from federal, state and local health authorities for personal health and safety, and updating our protocols as needed; 2) implementing a mandatory face-mask policy for employees at all of our locations, and providing them with those masks where needed; 3) enforcing social distancing in common areas and work areas, including production lines where possible; 4) implementing work-at-home programs where possible; and 5) sourcing supplies such as reusable masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning solutions for use by our employees. However, the highly-contagious Delta and Omicron variants impacted our operations in 2021 through incremental costs incurred relating to cleaning and sanitizing costs for the protection of the health of our employees and safety of our facilities, as well as costs of lost productivity from employee quarantines and testing, and cancellations of previously scheduled trade shows and customer events, resulting in negative impacts on our results of operations for the years ended January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021.

Although recent developments regarding the Pandemic appear to be positive, and point to the possibility that vaccination programs and other safety measures implemented throughout the United States may be having the hoped for beneficial affects intended, the extent to which the continuing circumstances around the Pandemic could affect our future business, operations and financial results continue to depend upon numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the timing of any relief that may come from the current program of nationwide vaccinations and its effect on the duration of the continuing economic and market disruptions related to the Pandemic, and whether such vaccines are effective against any current and new variants of coronavirus, and the nature, amounts and duration of any additional government stimulus measures designed to bolster the economy. As such, we continue to be unable to accurately predict the impact the Pandemic and the challenges it has created for the U.S. and global economies, will have on our financial performance and operations going forward due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, when or if herd immunity is achieved in the United States, especially in our key markets, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to attempt to control the Pandemic, the impact to our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” herein. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the Pandemic to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Sales and Operations
During 2021, we experienced increases in sales at both our Southeast and Western segments, as demand in our key markets of Florida, Arizona and California continued to increase, and the strong order entries we reported in prior quarters have translated into higher shipments in 2021. Our sales grew to $1,161.5 million in our 2021 fiscal year, an increase of $278.9 million, or 31.6%, compared to $882.6 million in 2020. Sales in 2021 includes a combined $107.1 million in sales from our Eco and Anlin acquisitions. Excluding sales from all 2021 acquisitions, we experienced solid organic growth of $164.4 million, or 18.6%, in 2021, compared to 2020. We believe this increased demand is being driven by improved economic conditions in 2021 and our markets in California have gained momentum since COVID restrictions were lifted, and our Texas and Arizona markets continued to strengthen. We continue to see strong demand in both our new construction and repair and remodel channels in the Southeast regions which showed strong demand as compared to the challenging conditions of 2020 which were a result of the Pandemic. Our Southeast business unit had sales of $968.7 million in 2021, an increase of $216.3 million, or 28.7%, compared to $752.4 million in 2020. Net sales of our Western segment increased $62.6 million, or 48.1%, to $192.8 million in 2021, from $130.2 million in 2020.
We are optimistic that we will see this growth we have experienced continue in 2022, and we continue to make strides in investing in the resources necessary to meet this increasing demand. During 2021 we faced headwinds from the pressure on our margins due to recruiting, training and workforce retention costs. Additionally, aluminum spot prices have increased significantly throughout the year, which leaves the unhedged portions of our expected aluminum usage exposed to the volatility of changing aluminum prices, as well as the increases in prices we have experienced in many of our other material costs, including glass, vinyl, hardware and supplier-based surcharges. As a result of these headwinds, we announced a 3% surcharge in Florida that took effect in November 2021 for all then existing and future orders to help offset these costs, which we believe began benefiting gross margin immediately through the completion of our 2021 fiscal year. Additionally, we announced another 6% to 12% price increase for new orders beginning November 1, 2021, that we expect to begin to impact our results beginning in 2022 due to our lead times.
- 30 -
Our backlog, which we define as customer orders that we have accepted but not yet shipped, has increased significantly, to $355.9 million as of January 1, 2022, from $199.5 million as of January 2, 2021. We define backlog as orders that we have received and have accepted from customers, but that have not yet shipped. The majority of this increase is a result of an increased level of order entry during 2021, but also includes increases relating to the acquisitions. However, during 2021, our backlog increased as a result of growth in orders above our capacity to keep pace with the increased demand. As a result, during 2021, we opened an additional approximately 130,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Fort Myers, Florida to provide additional manufacturing capacity.
During the first half of 2020, we also experienced some disruption in our ability to obtain adequate supplies of glass for our manufacturing processes by what we think were the impacts of the Pandemic on our glass supply chain partners, which ultimately resulted in an increase in our lead times to our customers. This factor lessened during the second half of 2020 and into 2021, and obtaining adequate supplies of glass has become less of a challenge to our supply chain. We continue to have good relations with our glass supply chain partners, and we have gained additional control over our supply chain for glass with our acquisition of a 75% stake in Eco, whose vertically integrated operations includes a glass manufacturing division which supplies all of the impact-resistant glass used in Eco’s window and door products. In addition, Eco’s glass division sells laminated glass products to other companies, including to us, as an additional source of revenue. We believe that our investment in Eco has provided us with a secure, high-quality, dependable supply of glass for our operations.
Liquidity and Cash Flow
During 2021, we generated $63.7 million in cash flow from operations, a decrease of $11.8 million, compared to 2020. In 2020, during the second half of the year, our order entry levels began increasing and continued to increase though the end of the year. Because of this increased demand for our products, we determined to continue to manufacture and ship during late December 2020, whereas in 2021, we had our usual holiday shut-down. As such, we saw a decrease in accounts payable at the end of 2021 from payments of payables not seen at the end of 2020 due to the continuation of operations through the end of the year. The resulted in a use of operating cash flow for payments of accounts payable at the end of 2021, compared to a source of operating cash flow at the end of 2020.
We ended the 2021 fiscal year with $96.1 million in cash, We have no scheduled debt repayment obligations until the maturity of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, and have $74.7 million in availability under the revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, which does not expire until October 2024.
Cash generated from operations was generally used to fund operations and investing cash flows, which was primarily composed of capital expenditures in 2021. However, in 2021, we consummated several acquisitions, including the Anlin Acquisition, which was funded primarily with proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, and incremental borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, but which also included the Eco Acquisition, the funding of which included using $31.1 million of cash on hand, and the acquisition of the assets of CRi, which was an all-cash acquisition and used $12.1 million of cash on hand. Additionally, during 2021, due to our decision in early 2020 to decrease spending on a majority of capital projects as part of our cash preservation strategy due to the uncertainty around the Pandemic, we increased our capital spending to near pre-Pandemic levels. This resulted in an increase in capital expenditures to $33.4 million, compared to $24.8 million in 2020, an increase of $8.6 million in cash used.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Analysis of Selected Items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations
- 31 -
- 32 -
Full Year 2022 Compared with Full Year 2021
Net sales
Net sales for 2021 were $1,161.5 million, a $278.9 million, or 31.6%, increase in sales, from $882.6 million in the prior year.
The following table shows net sales by segment (in millions, except percentages):
Net sales of our Southeast segment were $968.7 million in 2021, compared with $752.4 million in 2020, an increase of $216.3 million. Net sales of our Western segment were $192.8 million in 2021, compared with $130.2 million in 2020, an increase of $62.6 million. Sales of our Western segment are composed of sales of WWS.
The increase in net sales in 2021 of $278.9 million was primarily driven by organic sales growth at both our Southeast and Western segments and the effects of the recovery from the Pandemic, as well as revenues added through acquisitions, which included $107.1 million from our Eco and Anlin Acquisitions. We believe the organic increase in sales of our Southeast segment is due to a resumption of demand for our products in both the new construction and repair and remodel markets that approached the pre-Pandemic strength that existed in early 2020. Our direct-to-consumer brand also experienced solid organic growth in 2021, compared to 2020. Our Western segment experienced strong growth in 2021, compared to 2020, which we believe continued to see a strengthening housing market in the western United States that began in late 2020, but also as the effects of the Pandemic, which appeared to be more pronounced in the West, lessened in 2021 compared to last year. Sales of our Western segment include the increase from our CRi Acquisition.
Gross profit and gross margin
Gross profit was $403.5 million in 2021, an increase of $82.2 million, or 25.6%, from $321.3 million in the prior year. Gross margin was 34.7% in 2021, compared to 36.4% in the prior year, a percentage-point decrease of 1.7%. During the second quarter of 2021, in response to increasing demand and a resulting increase in our backlog of orders, we determined to increase our manufacturing headcount across our Florida operations. While this increase in headcount positions us to better respond to increasing demand through higher production rates, it also required additional investments in training and onboarding of the new members of our manufacturing team to maintain our high standards for safety and quality as new members gain experience in their new roles. These incremental investments resulted in a reduction in gross margin in 2021 as compared to 2020. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by inflationary conditions on materials, labor and material delivery costs, which continued to be prevalent in 2021. Earlier this year, we announced price increases to attempt to offset these inflationary conditions, which began to offset these cost impacts towards the end of 2021. We also implemented a 3% surcharge on all existing orders in Florida which took effect in November 2021 to immediately address these rising operating costs which began benefiting gross margin in the late third quarter of 2021.Additionally, we announced another 6% to 12% price increase for new orders beginning November 1, 2021, that we began to see the benefit of beginning of in 2022. Gross margin in 2021 benefited from improved operating efficiencies in our Western segment, and the addition of and accretion from our acquisitions of Eco, CRi and Anlin.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
SG&A expenses for 2021 were $303.0 million, an increase of $78.6 million, or 35.0%, from $224.4 million in 2020. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 26.1% in 2021, compared to 25.4% in 2020. The increase in SG&A is partially due to the inclusion of SG&A from our acquisitions of Anlin, Eco and CRi in 2021. Additionally, there were increases in 2021 compared to 2020 in several other categories, including the acquisition costs, additional Pandemic-response and inefficiency costs in the second half of 2021 due to the 2021 emergence of COVID variants, depreciation, stock-based compensation, as well as additional costs from investing in our strategic selling and marketing initiatives. SG&A was also impacted by higher distribution costs on increased sales levels.
Impairment of trade name
There was an impairment of our WWS trade name of $8.0 million in 2020. Following a decrease of 19.3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the 2019 second quarter, as well as continued deterioration in macro-economic conditions in our core western markets relating to the Pandemic, we determined to complete an interim impairment test of our WWS trade name as of October 3,
- 33 -
2020, which included decreases in modeling assumptions for net sales of our WWS reporting unit. Based on our revised modeling, we concluded that the fair value of our WWS trade name was less than its carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of our WWS trade name of $8.0 million in 2020.
Restructuring costs and charges
In April 2020, the Company’s management approved a plan to consolidate its manufacturing operations in Florida, which included exiting our manufacturing facility in Orlando, Florida, where our WinDoor and Eze-Breeze products were assembled and relocate the manufacturing of those products to our Venice and Tampa, Florida plants, respectively. We ceased production at the Orlando facility during June 2020. As a result of this consolidation, we recorded restructuring costs and charges totaling $4.2 million in the first nine months ended October 3, 2020.
Income from operations
Income from operations was $100.5 million in 2021, an increase of $15.8 million, from $84.7 million in 2020. Income from operations in 2021 includes $74.8 million from our Southeast segment and $25.6 million from our Western segment, compared to $85.8 million and $11.1 million from our Southeast and Western segments, respectively, in 2020, all after allocation of corporate operating costs in both periods. Income from operations in 2020 was also impacted by an impairment charge of $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 relating to our WWS trade name of our Western segment, and restructuring costs and charges of $4.2 million relating to our Florida plant consolidation actions taken in the 2020 second quarter, and further adjusted in the 2020 third quarter, relating to our Southeast segment. The increase in income from operations was also related to leverage from higher sales in 2021 compared to last year, as well as continued efficiency improvements at our Western segment. However, during the second quarter of 2021, in response to increasing demand and a resulting increase in our backlog of orders, we determined to increase our manufacturing headcount across our Florida operations. While this increase in headcount positions us to better respond to increasing demand through higher production rates, it also required additional investments in training and onboarding of the new members of our manufacturing team to maintain our high standards for safety and quality as new members gain experience in their new roles. These incremental investments resulted in a reduction in operating income in 2021 as compared to the 2020. Operating income was also negatively impacted by inflationary conditions on materials, labor and material delivery costs, which continued to be prevalent in 2021. Earlier this year, we announced price increases to attempt to offset these inflationary conditions, which began to benefit us late in 2021. We also implemented a 3% surcharge on all existing orders in Florida which took effect in November 2021 to then immediately address these rising operating costs which began benefiting operating income in 2021, and we believe will continue to benefit operating income as we move through early 2022. Additionally, we announced another 6% to 12% price increase for new orders beginning November 1, 2021, that we anticipate impacting our results in the beginning of 2022. Income from operations in 2021 also includes the operating profits of our February 1, 2021, Eco acquisition, and May 2, 2021 CRi acquisition.
Interest expense
Interest expense was $30.0 million in 2021, an increase of $2.3 million from $27.7 million in 2020. Interest expense in 2021 includes an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of the Second Additional Senior Notes totaling $60.0 million effective on January 25, 2021, which we used to finance a portion of the purchase price for our investment in Eco. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest costs relating to the amortization of the $3.3 million premium we received on the Second Additional Senior Notes.
Additionally, we redeemed the $425.0 million of 6.75% 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, with the $575.0 million of 4.375% 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 late in the third quarter of 2021. Interest expense in 2021, particularly our 2021 fourth quarter, included the offsetting effects of interest saving due to the decrease in the interest rate on the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, with the higher level of notes outstanding.
Debt extinguishment costs
Debt extinguishment costs totaled $25.5 million in 2021. On September 24, 2021, we completed the issuance of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, issued at 100% of their principal amount. Proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 were used, in part, to redeem in full the $425.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, including the related fees, costs and prepayment call premium discussed further below, prepay the outstanding term loan borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 of $54.0 million and the related fees and costs, and finance the Anlin Acquisition. See Note 5, Acquisitions, for a discussion of the Anlin Acquisition. Redemption in-full of the $425.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, including accrued and unpaid interest through September 27, 2021, also included a pre-payment call premium of 105.063% of face value, which totaled $21.5 million and is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 1, 2022. The remainder of debt extinguishment costs of $4.0 million is composed of $9.4 million of unamortized third-party deferred costs and lender fees relating to the 2021 Senior Notes due 2026, including the First and Second Add-On Notes, offset by $5.4 million of unamortized premiums we received from the First and Second Add-On Notes.
- 34 -
Income tax expense
Income tax expense was $9.8 million for 2021, representing an effective tax rate of 21.7%. This compares to income tax expense of $11.9 million for 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 20.9%. Our income tax expense for the year ended January 1, 2022 includes $1.7 million relating to our 75% share of the pre-tax earnings of Eco.
Income tax expense in 2021 and 2020 include discrete items of income tax benefit relating to excess tax benefits from the exercises of stock options and lapses of restrictions on stock awards, which totaled $861 thousand in 2021, and $769 thousand in 2020. The year ended January 2, 2021 also included the benefit of a refund from the state of Florida relating to excess taxes received by the state caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which totaled $553 thousand, net of its Federal tax effect. Other discrete items included in both periods include true-ups of research and development tax credit estimates to actual tax credits claimed, and other tax return filing related true-ups. Excluding discrete items of income tax, the effective tax rates for the years ended January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021, would have been income tax expense rates of 24.6% and 24.2%, respectively.
Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest
Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest for 2021 was $2.3 million and represents the share of the net income of Eco for the period, attributable to the 25% interest of Eco not acquired by the Company. There was no redeemable non-controlling interest in 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated by operations, supplemented by borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, if ever needed. We believe our cash generating capability will continue to provide us with financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, and to meet required debt payments, including debt service payments on borrowings and fund capital expenditures.
Consolidated Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flow results for 2021 and 2020:
Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $63.7 million for 2021, compared to $75.5 million for 2020.
The decrease in cash flows from operations of $11.8 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the changes in operating cash flows, including an increase of $244.6 million in collections from customers in 2021 compared to 2020, as the result of increased sales, which was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $153.8 million as the result of higher procurement of inventory, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $98.2 million due to a larger number of employees during 2021, compared to 2020, and an increase in debt service costs of $7.4 million in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily as a result of the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, and the higher level of notes outstanding thereunder as compared to the recently pre-paid 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Also, net tax payments increased $3.0 million in 2021, compared to 2020. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, increased by $6.0 million. Other collections of cash primarily relate to sales of scrap aluminum.
Direct cash flows from operations for 2021 and 2020 are presented below:
- 35 -
Inventory on hand as of January 1, 2022, was $91.4 million, an increase of $31.1 million from January 2, 2021. The increase in inventory on had primarily relates to acquisitions during 2021.
Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply. Inventory turns for the year ended January 1, 2022, was 10.0 times, on par with 10.8 times for the year ended January 2, 2021.
Management monitors and evaluates raw material inventory levels based on the need for each discrete item to fulfill short-term requirements calculated from current order patterns and to provide appropriate safety stock. Because the majority of our products are made-to-order, we have only a small amount of finished goods and work in progress inventory. Due to these factors, we believe our inventories are not excessive, and we expect the value of such inventories will be realized.
Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $253.9 million in 2021, compared to $114.4 million in 2020 an increase in cash used of $139.5 million. We used $220.7 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2021, compared with cash used for acquisitions in 2020 of $90.4 million.. Also, in 2021, we used cash of $33.4 million for capital expenditures, compared to $24.8 million in 2020, an increase of $8.6 million in cash used. Finally, in 2021, we received proceeds of $187 thousand from the sales of property, plant and equipment, compared to $766 thousand in 2019, an increase of $579 thousand in cash proceeds received from sales of property, plant and equipment.
Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $186.1 million in 2020, compared with cash provided of $42.0 million in 2020, an increase in cash provided of $144.1 million. In 2021, we issued $575.0 million in 4.375% 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, as well as the $60.0 million of Second Additional Senior Notes, including a premium of $3.3 million with the Second Additional Notes. which provided proceeds from issuances of senior notes in 2021 totaling $638.3 million. Proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 were used, in part, to redeem in full the $425.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, plus a pre-payment call premium of 105.063% of face value, which totaled $21.5 million, classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for 2021. We also prepaid the outstanding term loan borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 of $54.0 million, and subsequently reborrowed $60.0 million in proceeds under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 used in the Anlin Acquisition. Proceeds of $63.3 million from the issuance of the $60.0 million in Second Additional Senior Notes, including a premium of $3.3 million, were used to partially fund our acquisition of Eco. In 2020, we issued the First Additional Senior Notes, which provided proceeds of $53.2 million, including a premium of $3.2 million. Proceeds from the issuance of the First Additional Senior Notes were used to partially fund our acquisition of NewSouth.
We paid financing costs totaling $10.7 million in 2021, including financing costs relating to bank fees and professional services costs relating to the offering and issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2026 totaling $8.7 million, which included a 1.25% lender spread on the total principal value of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, or $7.2 million, and $1.5 million of other costs. We also paid $0.6 million in financing costs relating to the Fourth Amendment of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024. We also paid $1.4 million in 2021 related to the issuance of the Second Additional Senior Notes, compared to $1.3 million in 2020, related to the issuance of the First Additional Senior Notes. Taxes paid relating to common stock withheld from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards were $1.6 million in 2021, versus $0.8 million in 2020. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options for 2021 was $0.1 million, compared to proceeds of $0.6 million in 2020. There were proceeds from stock issued under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $0.5 million during 2021, compared to $0.3 million during 2020.
Share Repurchase Program. On May 22, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program of up to $30 million. The repurchases may be made in open market or private transactions from time to time. Repurchases of shares may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit repurchases when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so
- 36 -
under applicable laws. The Company bases repurchase decisions, including the timing of repurchases, on factors such as the Company’s stock price, general economic and market conditions, the potential impact on the Company’s capital structure, the expected return on competing uses of capital such as strategic acquisitions and capital investments, and other corporate considerations, as determined by management. From the inception of the program on May 22, 2019, through December 28, 2019,we made repurchases of 393,819 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $5.5 million. We made no repurchases under this program during 2020 or 2021. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We may make opportunistic purchases in the future.
Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Pandemic on our operations and cash flows, late in the first quarter of 2020, and continuing through the second quarter and early third quarter of 2020, we conserved cash by reducing the level of funding of capital projects. This period of cash conservation during 2020 resulted in a decrease of $6.5 million in cash used for capital expenditures, from $31.3 million in 2019, to $24.8 million in 2020. During the third quarter of 2020 and for the remainder of the year, we resumed and caught-up on funding of capital projects, which increased our level of capital spending. This increase in capital spending continued into 2021. In 2021, we spent $33.4 million on capital expenditures, compared to $24.8 million in 2020, an increase in $8.6 million, primarily representing equipment purchases and facility improvements expected to support growth.
Management expects to spend between $48 million and $52 million for capital expenditures in 2022. Our capital expenditure program is geared towards making investments in capital assets targeted at increasing both gross sales and margins, but also includes capital expenditures for maintenance capital.
Capital Resources and Debt Covenants
2021 Senior Notes due 2029
On September 24, 2021, we completed the issuance of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes (“2021 Senior Notes due 2029”), issued at 100% of their principal amount. The 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than any restricted subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the existing senior secured credit facilities or any permitted refinancing thereof. The 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the guarantors. The 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 were offered under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act, and have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act.
The 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 mature on October 1, 2029. Interest on the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 is payable semi-annually, in arrears, beginning on April 1, 2022, with interest accruing at a rate of 4.375% per annum from September 24, 2021. We incurred financing costs relating to bank fees and professional services costs relating to the offering and issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 totaling $8.7 million, which included a 1.25% lender spread on the total principal value of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, or $7.2 million, and $1.5 million of other costs, all of which are being amortized under the effective interest method. See “Deferred Financing Costs” below.
As of January 1, 2022, the face value of debt outstanding under the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 was $575.0 million, and accrued interest totaled $6.8 million. Proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 were used, in part, to redeem in full the $425.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, including the related fees, costs and prepayment call premium discussed further below, prepay the outstanding term loan borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 of $54.0 million and the related fees and costs, and finance the Anlin Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 5, Acquisitions, for a discussion of the Anlin Acquisition.
The indenture for the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 gives us the option to redeem some or all of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029. The indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 does not require us to make any mandatory redemptions or sinking fund payments. However, upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, the Company is required to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. We also may make optional redemptions at various premiums including a make-whole call at the then current treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2024, then 102.188% on or after August 1, 2021, 101.094% on or after August 2025, then at 100.000% on or after August 1, 2026.

to the Company; and (viii) designate the Company’s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications
2018 Senior Notes Due 2026
On August 10, 2018, we completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes (“2018 Senior Notes due 2026”), issued at 100% of their principal amount. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than any restricted subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the existing senior secured credit facilities or any permitted refinancing thereof. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and ranked pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the guarantors. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were offered under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act, and were not registered under the Securities Act.
On January 24, 2020, we completed an add-on issuance of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, or the First Additional Senior Notes, issued at 106.375% of their principal amount, resulting in a premium to us of $3.2 million. The First Additional Senior Notes were part of the same issuance of, and ranked equally and formed a single series with, the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Proceeds from the First Additional Senior Notes, including premium, were used, together with cash on hand, to pay the $90.4 million purchase price in the NewSouth Acquisition.
On January 25, 2021, we completed a second add-on issuance of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, or the Second Additional Senior Notes, issued at 105.5% of their principal amount, resulting in a premium to us of $3.3 million. The Second Additional Notes were part of the same issuance of, and ranked equally and form a single series with, the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Proceeds from the Second Additional Senior Notes, including premium, were used, together with $31.1 million in cash on hand, to pay the $94.4 million cash portion of the $100.5 million purchase price in the Eco Acquisition. The common stock portion of the purchase consideration was represented by the issuance of 357,797 shares of PGT Innovations, Inc. common stock on February 1, 2021, with a then-current value of $21.34 per share, which we discounted by an estimate of 20% for lack of marketability, as the common stock is are legally restricted from being sold by the recipient for a three-year period from February 1, 2021.
The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were to mature on August 10, 2026. However, effective on September 27, 2021, using proceeds from the issuance of the $575.0 million 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, discussed above, we redeemed in-full the $425.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, including accrued and unpaid interest through September 27, 2021, which totaled $4.5 million, and a pre-payment call premium of 5.063% of face value, which totaled $21.5 million and are classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 1, 2022.
2016 Credit Agreement due 2024
On February 16, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, among us, the lending institutions identified in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, and Truist Financial Corporation (formerly known as SunTrust Bank), as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 establishes senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $310.0 million, consisting of a $270.0 million Term B term loan facility originally maturing in February 2022 that amortizes on a basis of 1% annually during its six-year term, and a $40.0 million revolving credit facility originally maturing in February 2021 that included a swing line facility and a letter of credit facility. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 are, subject to exceptions, guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets as well as our direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries’ assets.
On March 16, 2018, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment, among other things, decreased the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024). On February 17, 2017, we entered into the first amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, which also resulted in decreases in the applicable margins, but which, unlike the Second Amendment, did not include any changes in lender positions.
On October 31, 2019, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 (“Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment provided for, among other things, (i) a three-year Term A loan in the then aggregate principal amount of $64.0 million (the “Initial Term A Loan”), maturing in October 2022, which refinanced in full our existing Term B term loan facility under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, and had no regularly scheduled amortization, and (ii) a new five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $80.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”), maturing in October 2024, which replaced our then existing $40.0 million revolving credit facility under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, and includes a swing-line facility and letter of credit facility. The Initial Term A Loan was repaid in full with proceed from the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029.
- 38 -
On October 25, 2021, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 ("Fourth Amendment"). The Fourth Amendment provides for, among other things, a three-year Term A loan in the aggregate maximum available amount of $60.0 million (the "Incremental Term A Loan"), maturing in October 2024, proceeds from which were used to fund the Anlin Acquisition. The Fourth Amendment does not change any terms relating to the Revolving Facility, under which we pay quarterly fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to a percentage spread (ranging from 0.25% to 0.35%) based on our first lien net leverage ratio. As of January 1, 2022, there were $5.3 million in letters of credit outstanding and $74.7 million available under the Revolving Facility. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 continue to be secured by substantially all of our assets, as well as our direct and indirect subsidiaries' assets, and is senior in position to the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029.
The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the term-loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 was 2.10%. as of January 1, 2022 and was 2.15% at January 2, 2021.
Deferred Financing Costs
All debt-related fees, costs and original issue discount, including those related to the revolving credit portion of the facility, is classified as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt. The activity relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the year ended January 1, 2022, are as follows:
Estimated amortization expense relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the years indicated, as of January 1, 2022, is as follows:
The contractual future maturities of long-term debt outstanding, as of January 1, 2022, are as follows (at face value):

Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt consists of the following:
(1)	Effective on September 24, 2021, the Company completed the issuance of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due October 1, 2029, issued at 100% of their principal amount. The proceeds from issuance of the new senior notes were used to finance the repayment of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million of 6.75% senior notes 2026, which required payment of a 5.063% call-premium totaling $21.5 million, lender fees of 1.25% of the face value of the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 totaling $7.2 million, accrued interest on the then outstanding senior notes and term loan totaling $4.5 million, and various costs of the senior note offering and the Anlin acquisition. The remainder of the proceeds of the new senior notes held as cash on hand, together with $60.0 million of new borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024, were subsequently used on October 25, 2021 for the Anlin Acquisition totaling $114.2 million. Any remaining unused proceeds from issuance of the new $575.0 million of senior notes will be held as operating cash on hand and used to pay, if any, the contingent consideration relating to the Anlin Acquisition. See Note 5. Acquisitions, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of the contingent consideration relating to the Anlin Acquisition.
(2)	Effective on August 10, 2018, the Company completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due August 10, 2026, issued at 100% of their principal amount. The senior notes were issued to finance, together with cash on hand, the WWS acquisition. On January 24, 2020, we issued an additional $50.0 million add-on senior notes, issued at 106.375% of their principal amount, to finance, together with cash on hand, the $90.4 million acquisition of NewSouth. Effective on January 25, 2021, we issued an additional $60.0 million add-on senior notes, issued at 105.5% of their principal amount, to finance together with $94.4 million of cash on hand, and fair value of $6.1 million in Company common stock, the $100.5 million acquisition of our 75% stake in Eco. See note (1) above for a discussion of the repayment of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 totaling $425.0 million.
(3)	Effective on October 25, 2021, the Company entered into the fourth amendment of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024. We borrowed a $60.0 million incremental term loan in connection with this amendment, the proceeds from which were used in combination with proceeds remaining under the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 for the Anlin Acquisition. See note (1) above for further discussion.
(4)	Fees, costs, premium and discount represents third-party fees, lender fees, other debt-related costs, and original issue premium and discount, recorded as a net reduction of the carrying value of the debt and are amortized over the lives of the debt instruments to which they relate under the effective interest method.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations.
On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 2. The following is a summary of our more significant accounting estimates that require the use of judgment in preparing the financial statements.
- 40 -
Valuation of Trade Names and Customer Relationships in Business Combinations
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of trade names, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value of the trade name intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method ("RFRM") which is a form of the income approach. Under the RFRM, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. The fair values of customer relationships are determined using the multi-period excess earnings method ("MPEEM"), which is also a form of the income approach. Under the MPEEM, the expected net cash flow an asset will generate, is discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.
We applied the RFRM to the valuation of trade names and MPEEM to customer relationships for acquisitions done during 2021, for which the most significant intangible assets identified were the Eco and Anlin trade names and customer relationships. Specific to these intangible assets, our estimates of projected revenue included forecast revenue growth rates, estimated existing customer retention rates, operating expense estimates and other estimates regarding contributory asset charges that required judgment by management. Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the Eco Acquisition was $74.3 million, which included its trade name with an estimated fair value of $34.9 million, and total customer relationships of $39.4 million. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the Anlin Acquisition was $77.8 million, which included its trade name with an estimated fair value of $35.4 million and its customer relationship asset of $42.1 million.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
We disclosed the Company’s accounting policy for Goodwill and Trade Names under Item 8, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter of each year, and at interim periods if needed based on occurrence of triggering events.
Given the general deterioration in economic and market conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the narrow excess of fair value over carrying value of our WinDoor and WWS trade names as described in 2019, the Company determined it should complete interim quantitative impairment tests of its WinDoor and WWS trade names as of the end of the Company’s first quarter of 2020. These interim impairment tests did not indicate that impairments of those assets existed at that time. Following a decrease of 19.3% in net sales in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of last year, as well as continued deterioration in macro-economic conditions in our core western markets relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we determined to complete a second interim impairment test of our WWS trade name as of July 4, 2020. For this second interim impairment test, we further decreased our modeling assumptions for net sales of our WWS reporting unit for our 2020 fiscal year based on a reassessment of our key assumptions in our modeling, including an updated assessment of macro industry growth in our WWS reporting unit’s key markets. We also decreased our 2021 growth rate assumption as we expect the challenging macro-economic conditions in our core western markets to continue during 2021. Based on our revised modeling, we concluded that the fair value of our WWS trade name was less than its carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of our WWS trade name of $8.0 million in our second quarter of 2020. Sales for our WWS reporting unit for the 2020 fiscal year exceeded our modeling assumptions used during our second impairment test of our WWS trade name as of July 4, 2020. As such, we performed a qualitative assessment as of the first day of our 2020 fourth quarter and concluded that it was not necessary to perform a Step 1 impairment test for our WWS trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets as no new triggering events or conditions were identified. During 2021, WWS enjoyed organic growth and operational improvements, and there were no new triggering events or conditions identified as of the first days of our 2021 fourth quarter. Therefore, we completed a qualitative assessment of our WWS trade name, which indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our WWS trade name exceeds it carrying value. As of January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021, the carrying value of our WWS trade name was $65.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04 is intended to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The transition to new reference interest rates will require certain contracts to be modified and ASU 2020-04 is intended to mitigate the effects of this transition. This new guidance was effective upon issuance of this ASU for contract modifications and hedging relationships on a prospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD OUTLOOK
Net sales
Looking ahead into 2022, we believe economic factors that impact our business currently are stable in all of our major markets. We have seen robust demand in our core geographies over the past eighteen months, and we believe that the substantial backlog we have at the end of 2021, which grew to $355.9 million at January 1, 2022, from $199.5 million at January 2, 2021, an increase of 78.4%, which included 60.7% of legacy growth, positions us for solid sales growth in 2022. We have been able to increase production to meet this increased demand in large part because of actions taken throughout 2021 to increase hiring, implement operations improvements, expand our manufacturing footprint, and manage our supply of key inputs such as glass and aluminum. Increased orders booked during the year translated into higher product shipments as we worked through, and continue to work through our backlog and decrease lead times. We are well positioned to meet strong demand across our key markets and continue our growth trajectory in 2022.
We expect 2022 full-year sales to range between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion, representing an increase of between 16% and 25%, as compared to 2021. This estimated sales range for 2022 includes our Eco Acquisition at 100% of its sales amount.
Gross profit and gross margin
We believe the following factors, which are not all inclusive, may impact our gross profit and gross margin in 2022:
•	Our gross margin percentages are influenced by total sales due to operating leverage of fixed costs, and also by product mix. We expect product mix to show more repair and remodel sales in 2022 due to acquisitions in 2021, whose sales are weighted more towards the repair and remodel channel.
•	During 2021, our gross profit and gross margin percentage were negatively impacted by inflationary pressure on our manufacturing inputs, including materials and labor. We have taken actions to attempt offset these factors, including previously communicated pricing actions throughout 2021, including 6 to 12 percent price increases for new orders that originated after November 1st. These actions already are contributing to top line growth which we believe will contribute to improvements in gross profit and gross margin in 2022. But inflationary headwinds continue to exist in 2022. As such, our focus in 2022 will be to continue to take actions to further improve operating efficiencies, including material usage and labor cost reductions.
•	Inflationary conditions continue to impact aluminum prices, which is one of our most significant raw materials. During the late summer of 2021, the price of aluminum hit all-time high spot prices, and at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the spot price of aluminum is near those all-time high levels. While we engage in a program of hedging our purchases of aluminum using cash flow derivative products to help us stabilize the cost of aluminum in our manufacturing process, our uncovered aluminum purchases have been and continue to be impacted by the increasing cost of the key raw material input. We believe there is uncertainty surrounding the future price of aluminum during 2022, and that volatility in the price of aluminum could be significant. As of the beginning of 2022, we were hedged for approximately 44% of our anticipated aluminum needs for 2022, at an average price of $1.11 per pound, which is an average representing the cash price per pound, excluding the delivery component for the Midwest Premium, and we were hedged for approximately 33% of the Midwest Premium delivery component needs for 2022, at an average price of $0.12 per pound.
•	Our gross profit and gross margin are also influenced by labor costs. During 2021, we invested in increasing our headcount to meet the increase in demand in all of our major markets. While the short-term impacts of these investments in headcount increases result in negative margin effects due to onboarding and training costs, as well as increased wages needed to attract sufficient headcount in this incredibly tight labor market, we believe of our labor force has become more tenured and, therefore, labor costs have begun to normalize as efficiencies are achieved. However, we believe a strong jobs environment throughout the United States will continue to result in a limited labor pool. We expect a tight labor market to continue during 2022, which we believe may result in operational efficiencies resulting from an experienced, trained workforce to be partially offset by the possibility for turnover due to this being an employee's job market.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)
This expense category will be affected by the inclusion of the SG&A of Anlin for the full year of 2022, including non-cash amortization depending on the level of amortizable intangible assets we have acquired. We are currently in the process of estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets. We expect to leverage fixed SG&A on anticipated higher sales in 2022, compared to 2021, and to continue to look for areas within SG&A to drive efficiencies. However, we expect to continue to invest in strategic marketing initiatives and advertising, especially at our NewSouth direct-to-consumer business which relies heavily on outreach to consumers. As such, savings from SG&A efficiencies could be more than offset by increases in spending on strategic programs which we believe will provide a favorable return on investment. We have also seen the effects of inflationary pressure on our distribution costs as fuel prices continue to rise and affect the cost of operating our fleet. As previously mentioned, we have increased prices in an attempt to address these inflationary pressures, but such benefits could be more than offset by rising prices, including fuel prices.
Depreciation and Amortization
- 42 -
Including the impact on depreciation and amortization from our Anlin Acquisition, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be approximately $55 million in 2022.
Interest expense
During 2022, we refinanced our $425.0 million of 6.75% 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 with our $575.0 million of 4.375% 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, incremental proceeds from which were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for the Anlin Acquisition. Additionally, we increased our borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement from $54.0 million to $60.0 million in October 2021 in connection with the Anlin Acquisition, without any impact to the borrowing rate thereunder. Although the level of our outstanding indebtedness increased to $635.0 million at January 1, 2022, from $479.0 at January 2, 2021, we expect that the increasing impact on interest expense from the higher level of indebtedness will be more than offset by the decrease in interest rate on our outstanding senior notes. We believe interest expense on our long-term debt will be approximately $28 million in 2021, including an estimated $1 million of non-cash amortization of net deferred financing costs.
Income tax expense
We expect to continue to be profitable in 2022, and thus, we believe that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 25% to 26%. This rate is based on the corporate income tax rate of 21%, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration the increase in income tax rate in Florida from 3.535% in 2021 to 5.5% through 2022.
Liquidity and capital resources
We had $96.1 million, of cash on hand as of January 1, 2022. During 2022, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to service the interest requirements on our debt, cover our operating expenses, and spend between $48 million and $52 million for capital expenditures in 2022. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, we have no further mandatory required payments remaining until the maturity in October 2024 of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024 but may continue to make voluntary prepayments in the future as our cash generation and other relevant factors permit. However, no assurances can be given that cash from operations will be sufficient for some or all these purposes. We currently have $74.7 million of availability under the Revolving Facility portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2024. The Revolving Facility also expires in October 2024.
