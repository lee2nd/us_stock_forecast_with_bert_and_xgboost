Plan of Operation
Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) market the licensing of the Company’s technology in states in the U.S. where marijuana and/or hemp has been legalized both for medicinal and/or recreational use, and in the Canadian provinces; (ii) seek to raise additional equity funding so that the Company may pursue the construction and operation of a facility to produce and market hemp cigarettes to be located in Northern Nevada; and (iii) complete the transactions which are the subjects of the two letters of intent signed by the Company which include acquiring an Oregon company which specializes in hemp-related products and forming a joint venture to produce, market and distribute hemp cigarettes and hemp-based products in the United States, Canada and Mexico using the Company’s Patented and Patent Pending Technologies. During the next 12 months, our cash requirements include expenses to market our technology; expenses to construct and operate a facility to produce and market hemp cigarettes to be located in Northern Nevada; the payment of our SEC reporting and filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; and costs incident to maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional equity funds to successfully commence and operate a facility to produce and market hemp cigarettes. We have no commitments to raise any additional funds at the present time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to the Company.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared Year Ended December 31, 2020
We had no revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021. We hope to start earning revenues during the present fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.
We incurred general and administrative expenses of $220,576 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,985 from the $222,561 of general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. We incurred depreciation of $35,350 in the year ended December 31, 2021 which is the same as the $35,350 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020.
We incurred interest expense of $58,359 in the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $15,404 from the $42,955 of interest expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due to the increase in aggregate principal balance of the Convertible notes payable in the later period from increased borrowings, and increases in interest rates in some of the Notes Payable in the later period. We also incurred interest expense - related party of $2,152 in the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2,493 from the $4,645 of interest expense - related party incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is due to the Company’s repayment of $10,000 of principal balance of the Notes Payable-Related Party in the later period.
We incurred a net loss of $316,437, or approximately $0.02 per share, in the year ended December 31, 2021, which is $10,926 more than the net loss of $305,511 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the net loss incurred in the later period is largely attributable to an increase in interest expense incurred in the later period.
Capital Resources
The cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of the following: The net loss of $316,437 partially offset by $35,350 in depreciation, $82,500 in issuance of common stock for services, a $30,127 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decrease of $5,348 in accounts payable and accrued expenses - Related party, and a $2,711 increase in deposit, resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $176,519.
The cash flows from operating activities during the prior year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the following: The net loss of $305,511 partially offset by $35,350 in depreciation, $74,500 as warrant expense, an increase of $12,145 in accounts payable and accrued expenses - Related Party, and a decrease of $4,171 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $187,687.
The cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of the following: We received proceeds from exercise of warrants of $100, proceeds from the sale of common stock of $150,000, proceeds from convertible notes payable of $50,000, and repayments on notes payable - related parties of $10,000, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $190,100.
The cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the following: We received cash proceeds from the sale of common stock of $160,001, proceeds from notes payable of $25,500, proceeds from convertible notes payable of $50,000, proceeds from notes payable - related parties of $18,749, and repayments on notes payable - related parties of $30,000, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $224,250.
Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained operating losses during the current year-to-date and may not achieve the level of profitable operations to sustain its activities. These factors raise substantial doubt as to its ability to obtain debt and/or equity financing and achieve profitable operations.
Management intends to raise additional operating funds to fund operations for the next 12 months through proceeds to be received from the planned sale of our hemp farming equipment, and through raising funds through equity and/or debt offerings. However, there can be no assurance management will be successful in its endeavors. Ultimately, the Company will need to achieve profitable operations in order to continue as a going concern.
There are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support its working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available to the Company it may be required to curtail its operations.
Emerging Growth Company Critical Accounting Policy Disclosure
The Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging grown company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company may elect to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period in the future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had no off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind for the year ended December 31, 2021.
