Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Plan of Operation
We are focused on providing renewable energy solutions and energy-efficient applications to drive better health and living. We currently have core subsidiaries including solar and air purification. We built our portfolio through synergistic acquisitions, and partnerships to provide a rich, diversified holding base. The Company’s initial focus is on solar energy and we are committed to building a foundation for future expansion opportunities and building brands based on technology solutions we believe will increase efficiencies across various markets. We strive to create long-term value for our shareholders by helping our partner companies to increase their market penetration, grow revenue and improve cash flow and that complement our desire to build a comprehensive national renewable energy network. The Company is actively looking for and executing on strategic initiatives to sell, partner with or spin-off other non-renewable energy related assets.
Results from Operations - For the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020.
Net Revenue
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company had total sales of $808,902 and $2,878,161, respectively. The decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower solar revenues resulting from the implementation of a new business model.
Cost of Revenue
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, cost of revenue was $736,746 and $2,204,391, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to the decreased revenues from our solar division.
Gross Profit
As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit was $72,156 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $673,770, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in our overall gross profit was primarily a result of lower revenues from our solar division.
Operating Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, total operating expenses were $5,687,490 and $3,972,882, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional and legal fees, impairment of goodwill, and investor relations, partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees. Professional and legal fees were $1,027,376 in 2021, compared to $316,239 in 2020, an increase of $711,137. The increase was due primarily to legal fees related to the Direct Solar legal matter, and acquisition activity. Impairment of goodwill was $680,772 in 2021 and related to Direct Solar, compared $0 in 2020. Investor relations expense was $539,195 in 2021, compared to $181,637 in 2020, an increase of $357,558. The increase in investor relations expenses was primarily due to increased investor relations activity during the year.
Other Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, other expense was $148,613 and $1,145,393, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to $16,772 of amortization of debt discounts in 2021 compared to $2,174,273 in 2020, partially offset by a loss of $76,627 in 2021 on change in fair value of derivative liability and equity securities compared to a gain in 2020 of $1,552,249.
Net Loss
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, net loss was $5,763,947 and $4,444,505, respectively. The increase in net loss is primarily a result of lower revenues and higher operating costs in 2021, partially offset by lower “other expense” in 2021 compared to 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to achieve profitable operations in the future, if not it may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Company’s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to achieve profitability. The Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Company’s ability to achieve profitable operations.
To continue operations for the next 12 months we will have a cash need of approximately $3.0 million. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s). The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above, although there is no guarantee that the Company will ultimately do so.
Advances from Officer
On May 18, 2021, the Company entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release (the “Separation Agreement”) with Gregory Lambrecht, former executive officer and director of the Company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement Mr. Lambrecht resigned as an officer and director of the Company and agreed to terminate his employment agreement with the Company. The Company agreed to pay Mr. Lambrecht $764,480 due in unpaid accrued compensation and $606,372 in indebtedness plus accrued interest through the date of the Agreement (the “Accrued Debt”) as follows: (i) the Company agreed to issue Mr. Lambrecht 362,987 shares of Common Stock (with standard restrictive legend) valued at $0.75 per share, equaling $272,240, (ii) the Company agreed to pay Mr. Lambrecht $250,000 within two business days of the date of the Separation Agreement, and (iii) the remaining amount of Accrued Debt of $848,612 will be satisfied through the issuance by the Company of a promissory note (the “Note”). The Note provides for ten percent (10%) per annum interest commencing as of August 1, 2021. The monthly payment amount of principal and interest shall be $21,523, with the first payment of $21,523 due September 1, 2021, and a final payment amount of $21,523 due on August 1, 2025. At December 31, 2021, the balance due was $804,896.
Our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 are summarized below:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $4,869,341 compared to $2,018,724 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to proceeds from long-term notes payable and proceeds from the sale of preferred stock Classes C and D.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loss Contingencies
The Company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return benefits or consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
