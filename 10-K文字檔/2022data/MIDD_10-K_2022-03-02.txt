Material Cash Requirements
The company's material cash requirements from contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt obligations, operating lease obligations, tax obligations and continent contingent purchase price payments to the sellers that were deferred in conjunction with various acquisitions. See Notes 3, 5 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Related Party Transactions
From January 3, 2021 through the date hereof, there were no transactions between the company, its directors and executive officers that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and represents the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The company’s contracts can have multiple performance obligations or just a single performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
Within the Commercial Foodservice Equipment and Residential Foodservice Equipment Groups, the estimated standalone selling price of equipment is based on observable prices. Within the Food Processing Equipment Group, the company estimates the standalone selling price based on expected cost to manufacture the good or complete the service plus an appropriate profit margin.
Control may pass to the customer over time or at a point in time. In general, the Commercial Foodservice Equipment and Residential Foodservice Equipment Groups recognize revenue at the point in time control transfers to their customers based on contractual shipping terms. Revenue from equipment sold under our long-term contracts within the Food Processing Equipment group is recognized over time as the equipment is manufactured and assembled. Installation services provided in connection with the delivery of the equipment are also generally recognized as those services are rendered. Over time transfer of control is measured using an appropriate input measure (e.g., costs incurred or direct labor hours incurred in relation to total estimate). These measures include forecasts based on the best information available and therefore reflect the company's judgment to faithfully depict the transfer of the goods.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method for the majority of the company’s inventories. The company evaluates the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. The company’s policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangibles
The company’s business acquisitions result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill and include trademarks and trade names, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Trademarks and trade names are deemed to be indefinite-lived. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing.
On an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company performs an impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The company considers qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying value.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit; actual and projected revenue and operating margin; relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible is less than its carrying value.
Goodwill Valuations
The reporting units at which we test goodwill for impairment are our operating segments. These consist of the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group, the Food Processing Equipment Group and the Residential Kitchen Equipment Group. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of goodwill.
In performing a quantitative assessment, if required, the company estimates each reporting unit's fair value under an income approach using a discounted cash flow model. The income approach uses each reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The financial projections reflect management's best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected period including forecasted revenue growth, operating margins, tax rate, capital expenditures, depreciation, amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values. Additionally, the company validates the estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the fair value estimate using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. The company considers the implied control premium and conclude whether it is reasonable based on other recent market transactions.
The company performed a qualitative assessment as of October 3, 2021 over all three reporting units and as a result of the qualitative assessments, the company determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than the carrying amounts.
In estimating the fair value of its reporting units, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment could have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
Indefinite-Life Intangible Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks and trade names, we analyze the variety of events or factors that may impact the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible, including, but not limited to: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant factors. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our long-range plans; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a discount rate using a market based weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-life intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.
In performing the quantitative analysis on these trademark assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.
•Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our long-range plans and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge.
•In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of the trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given market segment.
•In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used the market based weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets.
Based on the qualitative assessment as of October 3, 2021, the company determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of its other indefinite-life intangible assets are greater than the carrying amounts and no quantitative analyses were required.
As of September 27, 2020, the company identified several trademarks and trade names with indicators of potential risk for impairment and performed quantitative assessment. As a result of quantitative testing the company recognized $11.6 million of impairment charges associated with several trademarks, none of which were individually material. There were no other impairments in fiscal 2020 or 2021.
The company continues to monitor the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the outlook for demand of its products and the impact on its business and financial performance. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trademarks and trade names could occur, which could have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
Convertible Debt
The company issued convertible debt with debt and equity components. The company evaluated the different components and features of the hybrid instrument and determined whether certain elements were embedded derivative instruments which require bifurcation. Components of convertible debt instruments that upon conversion may be settled fully in cash or partly in cash based on a net-share settlement basis are accounted for separately as long-term debt and equity when the conversion feature of the convertible bonds constitute an embedded equity instrument. When an equity instrument is identified, proceeds from issuance are allocated between debt and equity by measuring first the liability component and then determining the equity component as a residual amount. Prior to January 3, 2021, the liability component was measured as the fair value of a similar nonconvertible debt, which results in the recognition of a debt discount. The debt discount amortizes to interest expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, using the effective interest method based on the expected maturity of the debt. The equity component is reported in additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.
The company allocated transaction costs related to the issuance of convertible debt using the same proportions as the proceeds from the convertible debt. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to interest expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings over the term of the convertible debt using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted within additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity.
Effective January 3, 2021, the company early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The convertible debt is now accounted for as a single liability and therefore the company no longer recognized any amortization of debt discounts as non-cash interest expense.
For additional information regarding the company's convertible debt, see Note 5, Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension Benefits
The company sponsors pension benefits to certain employees. The accounting for these plans depends on assumptions made by management, which are used by actuaries the company engages to calculate the projected and accumulated obligations and the annual expense recognized for these plans. These assumptions include expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates.
The amount of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses recognized in the current year’s operations is based on amortizing the unrecognized gains or losses for each plan that exceed the larger of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets, also known as the corridor. The amount of unrecognized gain or loss that exceeds the corridor is amortized over the average future service of the plan participants or the average life expectancy of inactive plan participants for plans where all or almost all of the plan participants are inactive. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense.
Income taxes
The company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company. The company follows the provisions under ASC 740-10-25 that provides a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition of a tax benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date.

Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results
An investment in shares of the company's common stock involves risks. The company believes the risks and uncertainties described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and in "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" are the material risks it faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may impair its business operations. If any of the risks identified in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" actually occurs, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of the company's common stock could decline.
