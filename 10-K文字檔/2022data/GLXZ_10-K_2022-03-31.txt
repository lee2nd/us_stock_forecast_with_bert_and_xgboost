ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This discussion should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information. Some of the information contained in this discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties; therefore our “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” should be reviewed for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements.
OVERVIEW
We develop, acquire, assemble and market technology and entertainment-based products and services for the gaming industry for placement on casino floors and on legal internet gaming sites. Our products and services primarily relate to licensed casino operators’ table games activities and focus on either increasing their profitability, productivity and security or expanding their gaming entertainment offerings in the form of proprietary table games, electronically enhanced table game platforms, fully-automated electronic tables and other ancillary equipment. In addition, we license intellectual property to legal internet gaming operators. Our products and services are offered in highly regulated markets throughout the world. Our products are assembled at our headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as outsourced for certain sub-assemblies in the United States.
Results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated gross revenues of $19,984,378 compared to $10,230,316 in 2020, representing an increase of $9,754,062, or 95.3%. This increase was directly attributable to the re-opening of a significant portion of our land-based customers after the restrictions due to the COVID-19 crisis were lifted. Also, our online gaming revenues increased significantly due primarily to the acquisition of PGP in August of 2020 as well as to the opening of new markets in the U.S.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $10,646,524 in 2021 compared to $8,964,930 in 2020, representing an increase of $1,681,594, or 18.8%. This increase was due to the 2021 employee bonus accrual being included in the current year as compared to no bonus accrual being included in the comparable prior-year period. Also, higher expenses were incurred in the current period directly related to the opening of jurisdictions throughout 2021 as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted (sales commissions, royalty expenses and repairs and maintenance of BJS units). Lastly, higher insurance payments were incurred in the current period as compared to the comparable prior-year period related to the financed Directors & Officers (“D&O) policy. These increased expenses incurred were offset by a decrease in legal fees related to the Triangulum Lawsuit and a decrease in distributor fees related to the acquisition of PGP in August 2020.
Research and development expenses were $520,449 in 2021 compared to $487,679 in 2020, representing an increase of $32,770, or 6.7%. This increase was primarily due to the 2021 employee bonus accrual. Prior year did not include an employee bonus accrual.
Share-based compensation expenses were $1,532,455 in 2021 compared to $737,991 in 2020, representing an increase of $794,464, or 107.7%. This increase was due to the quarterly restricted shares granted to our Board members being issued at a higher stock price than the comparable prior-year period. The increase was also due to increased amortization related to more shares being granted in the current period than the comparable prior-year period (two employees, a contractor and an additional Board member).
As a result of the changes described above, income from operations was $4,345,126 in 2021 compared to a loss from operations of $(2,255,010) in 2020, an increase of $6,600,136, or 292.7%.
Total interest expense was $1,505,386 in 2021 compared to $683,357 in 2020, an increase of $822,029, or 120.3%. The increase was attributable to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into on November 15, 2021. Loan fees related to the MSPLP, the NSB Term Loan and the Revolving Loan were written off in November 2021. Also, the Fortress Credit Agreement bears a higher interest rate than the NSB Term Loan, the Revolving Loan, the MSPLP and the Triangulum promissory note, along with higher amortization on loan fees and warrants issued. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information” for further details.
Share redemption consideration was $682,469 in 2021 compared to $781,928 in 2020, a decrease of $99,459, or 12.7%. The decrease was attributable to the settlement of the Triangulum litigation on November 15, 2021. A total of $411,316 in accrued interest through November 15, 2021 was paid in connection with the settlement. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information” for further details.
The income tax expense was $48,637 in 2021 based on an effective rate of 2.25 percent compared to the benefit of ($605,936) in 2020 based on an effective rate of 17.42 percent. The 2.25 percent effective tax rate for 2021 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 percent and was primarily attributable to (i) increased tax benefit from the exercise of stock options; (ii) the increased foreign rate differential and (iii) the Company maintaining a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to net income (loss) to exclude interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, foreign currency exchange loss, change in fair value of interest rate swap liability and severance and other expenses related to litigation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). However, Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes that disclosure of the Adjusted EBITDA metric offers investors, regulators and other stakeholders a view of our operations in the same manner management evaluates our performance. When combined with U.S. GAAP results, management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides a comprehensive understanding of our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or (loss) to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
(1)
Includes expenses associated with the Triangulum Lawsuit in both 2021 and 2020. There is a credit balance in 2021 due to $720,000 in D&O insurance claim payments received in 2021.
Liquidity and capital resources. We have generally been able to fund our continuing operations, our investments, and the obligations under our existing borrowings through cash flow from operations. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, we were required to raise funds from financing sources in order to maintain operations. In addition to our normal operations, we may make acquisitions of products, technologies or entire businesses. Our ability to access capital for operations or for acquisitions will depend on conditions in the capital markets and investors’ perceptions of our business prospects and such conditions and perceptions may not always favor us.
As of December 31, 2021, we had total current assets of $23,890,122 and total assets of $40,452,705. This compares to $11,562,833 and $30,574,594, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The increase in total current assets as of December 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the accounts receivable balance, resulting from higher billings and lower collections directly related to the COVID-19 crisis. Also, the Company entered into the Fortress Credit Agreement on November 15, 2021, which provided $5,273,464 in cash to the Company, after settlement of the NSB Term Loan, the Revolving Loan, the MSPLP and the Triangulum promissory note. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information” for further details. The increase in total assets as of December 31, 2021 was offset by amortization on the Company’s long-term other intangible assets.
Our total current liabilities as of December 31, 2021 increased to $4,401,071 from $4,247,794 as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Company accruing for 2021 employee bonuses and an increase in accrued royalties in our online gaming business. These increases were offset by a decrease in current portion of long-term debt which was repaid in connection with the Fortress Credit agreement. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information” for further details.
Despite the continuing effects of the COVID-19 crisis, our business was profitable and cash-flow positive in 2021. Based on our current forecast of operations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and to meet the obligations under our financing arrangements as they come due over at least the next 12 months.
We continue to file applications for new or enhanced licenses in several jurisdictions, which may result in significant future legal and regulatory expenses. A significant increase in such expenses may require us to postpone growth initiatives or investments in personnel, inventory and research and development of our products. It is our intention to continue such initiatives and investments. However, to the extent we are not able to achieve our growth objectives or raise additional capital, we will need to evaluate the reduction of operating expenses.
Our operating activities provided $6,003,576 in cash for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash used of $1,633,132 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher net income for the period as a result of the re-opening of a significant portion of our land-based customers after the restrictions due to the COVID-19 crisis were lifted. Also, higher depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation contributed to the higher operating cash flow. These increases were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and accrued expenses.
Investing activities used cash of $233,734 for the year December 31, 2021, compared to cash used of $6,456,714 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to closing of the acquisition of PGP in August 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,362,293. This compares to $4,389,234 cash provided by financing activities for the comparable prior-year period. The cash inflow in the current year was due to the Fortress Credit Agreement, offset by the pay-off of the Nevada State Bank (“NSB”) Term Loan, the Revolving Loan, the MSPLP and the Triangulum promissory note.
Critical Accounting Policies. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to understanding and evaluating our financial results:
Revenue recognition. We account for our revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We generate revenue primarily from the licensing of our intellectual property. We recognize revenue under recurring fee license contracts monthly as we satisfy our performance obligation, which consists of granting the customer the right to use our intellectual property. Amounts billed are determined based on flat rates or usage rates stipulated in the customer contract.
Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting asset is below the carrying amount. If found to be impaired, the carrying amounts will be reduced, and an impairment loss will be recognized.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements. We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
