COVID-19 Impact
Central has been impacted by COVID-19 in a number of ways, including increased demand and sales in fiscal 2020 and 2021. The increased demand for our products challenged our supply chain and our ability to procure and manufacture enough product to meet the high levels of demand. Our supply chain experienced disruptions and delays which resulted in increased operational and logistics costs. At some of our facilities, we have experienced reduced productivity and increased employee absences. The pandemic and related increase in demand created operational challenges which impacted our service and fill rates.
Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are currently open and operational. To mitigate the impact of supply constraints of commodity, materials, freight and labor and extended inventory transit times and the resulting impact on our service and fill rates, we increased inventory levels in fiscal 2022 and our service and fill rates significantly improved in fiscal 2022. We continue to face high inflation in commodities, materials, labor and freight and the limited availability of labor. We have instituted significant pricing actions to mitigate the impact of the current inflationary environment although inflationary pressures continue to result in significant increases in costs for commodities, materials, labor and freight. Recently, inflation and global economic conditions have impacted consumer purchasing behavior resulting in higher inventory levels at our retail customers and at Central.
We may experience additional disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues, although we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact or timing of those events, and we may not be able to mitigate such impact. While vaccination efforts and the easing of government restrictions have signaled an improving public health environment, there remain concerns about COVID variants and the coming flu season, and the timing of a full recovery remains uncertain. The ultimate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current high inflation environment on consumer behavior is unclear. Forecasting and planning remain challenging in the current environment and will continue to be challenging with public health concerns and inflationary cost pressures expected to continue into fiscal year 2023.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs with our cash and revolving credit facility as we manage through the current economic and health environment. In the current uncertain environment, our employees, customers and consumers will continue to be our priority as we manage our business to deliver long-term growth.
Results of Operations (GAAP)
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales:
Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021
Net Sales
Net sales for fiscal 2022 increased $34.9 million, or 1.1%, to $3,338.6 million from $3,303.7 million in fiscal 2021, due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions in our Garden segment. Organic net sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the last 12 months, decreased $108.1 million, or 3.3% in fiscal 2022. Generally, in both operating segments, volume declines were only partially offset by increased prices we implemented in response to high inflation. Our branded product sales, which include products we produce under Central brand names and products we produce under third-party brands, increased $53.8 million to $2.6 billion, and sales of other manufacturers’ products decreased $18.9 million to $730 million. Sales of branded products represented 78% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 compared with 77% in fiscal 2021. Sales of other manufacturers' products represented the balance of our net sales.
The following table indicates each class of similar products which represented approximately 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal years presented:
Pet net sales decreased $16.8 million, or 0.9%, to $1,878.1 million in fiscal 2022 from $1,894.9 million in fiscal 2021. Net sales in the prior year included $3.9 million of sales from the Breeder’s Choice business we sold in December 2020. Organic net sales decreased $12.9 million, or 0.7%, as compared to the prior year. The decline in organic sales was due primarily to a volume-based sales decrease in our private label pet bed business attributable primarily to SKU rationalization and listing losses as we exited some profit-challenged product lines. Additionally, both aquatics and live fish had sales declines. The declines were partially offset by price driven increases in our dog and cat treats and toy business, outdoor cushion business and animal health business. Pet branded sales decreased $25.9 million, and sales of other manufacturers' products increased $9.1 million.
Garden net sales increased $51.7 million, or 3.7%, to $1,460.5 million in fiscal 2022 from $1,408.8 million in fiscal 2021. The sales increase was due to our fiscal 2021 acquisitions of DoMyOwn, Hopewell Nursery, Green Garden Products and D&D Commodities, which contributed $146.9 million of non-organic sales partially offset by an organic sales decrease of $95.2 million, or 6.8%. The organic sales decrease was due primarily to unfavorable weather and changing consumer and retailer buying patterns in response to high inflation and recessionary pressures. Most of our garden businesses had decreased sales, most notably in our chemical and controls business and in our sales of other manufacturers’ products, with the exception of wild bird feed which benefited from price increases taken to offset significant commodity inflation. Garden branded sales increased $79.7 million while sales of other manufacturers' products decreased $28.0 million.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in fiscal 2022 increased $21.4 million, or 2.2%, to $992.3 million from $970.9 million in fiscal 2021. Gross margin improved 30 basis points to 29.7% in fiscal 2022 from 29.4% in fiscal 2021. Garden drove the increase in gross profit and gross margin but both segments were impacted by the rapidly increasing cost environment. We have implemented significant price increases that positively impacted our fiscal 2022 results and intend to continue to seek further price increases to help offset the rising costs, but we do not anticipate we will be able to fully offset the expected cost pressures in fiscal 2023.
In the Pet segment, gross profit and margin were relatively flat due primarily to increased commodity, freight and labor costs and a volume decline in our pet bedding business, partially offset by price increases taken to combat inflation. In the Garden segment, the improved gross profit and margin were due primarily to price increases and the favorable impact of our fiscal 2021 acquisitions, which included the impact of purchase accounting in fiscal 2021, partially offset by increased commodity, freight and labor costs, most notably in our chemical and controls business, which was also impacted by volume declines.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15.9 million, or 2.2%, from $716.4 million in fiscal 2021 to $732.3 million in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 21.7% in fiscal 2021 to 21.9% in fiscal 2022; both the Garden segment and corporate contributed to the increased percentage. Selling, general and administrative expense increased due primarily to the four fiscal 2021 acquisitions in our Garden segment including the amortization of the intangible assets resulting from purchase accounting, which did not have a full 12 months of expense in the prior year, and increased corporate expenses. Corporate expenses are included within administrative expense and relate to the costs of unallocated executive, administrative, finance, legal, human resource, and information technology functions.
Selling and delivery expense decreased $5.6 million, or 1.5%, to $358.1 million in fiscal 2022 and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 11.0% in fiscal 2021 to 10.7% in fiscal 2022. The decrease in selling and delivery expense was due primarily to a customer change from store delivery to warehouse pick-up, and a lower product volume delivered, partially offset by the increased expense related to the four fiscal 2021 acquisitions.
Warehouse and administrative expense increased $21.5 million, or 6.1%, to $374.2 million in fiscal 2022 and increased as a percentage of net sales to 11.2% in fiscal 2022 from 10.7% in fiscal 2021. The increased expense was driven by the addition of our four fiscal 2021 acquisitions in the Garden segment and increased rent expense at several facilities. Corporate expenses increased $10.3 million due primarily to growth in headcount, resulting in increased payroll costs, and increased third-party spend as we increased our investment in implementing our Central to Home strategy and to increased non-cash equity compensation. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.
Operating Income
Operating income increased $5.5 million, or 2.2%, to $260.0 million in fiscal 2022 from $254.5 million in fiscal 2021. Our operating margin was 7.8% in fiscal 2022, increasing from 7.7% in fiscal 2021. Increased sales of $34.9 million and a 30 basis point increase in gross margin were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expense. Both operating income and margin were favorably impacted by significant pricing actions taken in response to the current high inflationary environment. The near-term economic environment remains volatile and likely to have an unfavorable impact on our results as we expect our margins and results to continue to be challenged in fiscal 2023.
Pet operating income increased $0.7 million, or 0.3%, to $208.9 million in fiscal 2022 from $208.2 million in fiscal 2021. Pet operating income increased due to lower selling, general and administrative expense partially offset by a decrease in net sales. Pet operating margin improved 10 basis points due to lower selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales.
Garden operating income increased $15.2 million, or 11.0%, to $154.0 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was due to increased sales and higher gross profit partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Garden’s operating results were positively
impacted by a full year’s results from the acquisitions made in fiscal 2021, partially offset by poor weather conditions during the peak garden season. Garden operating margin improved 70 basis points to 10.5% due primarily to increased sales and an improved gross margin partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales and the initial inventory-related impact of purchase accounting from our four recent acquisitions.
Corporate expenses increased $10.3 million due primarily to growth in headcount, resulting in increased payroll costs, and increased third-party spend as we increased our investment in implementing our Central to Home strategy and to increased non-cash equity compensation. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense decreased $0.7 million, or 1.1%, from $58.2 million in fiscal 2021 to $57.5 million in fiscal 2022. In October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding aggregate principal amount 6.125% senior notes due 2023 with the remainder for general corporate purposes. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we recognized incremental interest expense of approximately $10.0 million in fiscal 2021. Partially offsetting the reduction from the prior year’s incremental interest expense was increased interest expense in the current year due primarily to higher average debt outstanding related to our issuance in April 2021 of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031.
Debt outstanding on September 24, 2022 was $1,186.6 million compared to $1,185.8 million as of September 25, 2021. Our average borrowing rate for fiscal 2022 was 4.5% compared to 4.4% for fiscal 2021.
Other Expense
Other expense is comprised of income or loss from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other expense was $3.6 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $1.5 million for fiscal 2021, due primarily to foreign currency losses in fiscal 2022.
Income Tax
Our effective income tax rate was 23.2% for fiscal 2022 compared to 21.6% for fiscal 2021. The increase in our effective income tax rate was due primarily to a reduced tax benefit from stock compensation compared to the prior year.
Net Income and Earnings Per Share
Our net income for fiscal 2022 was $152.2 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, compared to $151.7 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2021. An improvement in operating income in fiscal 2022 was partially offset by increased other expense and income taxes. Additionally, fiscal 2022 EPS was aided by a 1% decrease in diluted shares.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
For a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 filed with the SEC.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, organic sales, and non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense (or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.
We have also provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of businesses purchased or exited in the prior 12 months, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business without the impact of recent acquisitions or dispositions.
The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and other users of our financial statements, by allowing for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operating performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and we believe these measures similarly may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial and operating performance and the trends in our business from management's point of view. While our management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.
Non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:
•Incremental expenses from note redemption and issuance: we have excluded the impact of the incremental expenses incurred from the note redemption and issuance as they represent an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of these expenses supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.
•Loss on sale of business: we have excluded the impact of the loss on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this loss supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.
From time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.
The non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:
(1)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due 2023. As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred incremental expenses of approximately $10.0 million, comprised of a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized financing costs in interest expense. These amounts are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
(2)During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss of $2.6 million, included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business unit after concluding it was not a strategic business for our Pet segment.
Organic Net Sales Reconciliation
We have provided organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, because we believe it permits investors to better understand the performance of our historical business. We define organic net sales as net sales from our historical business derived by excluding the net sales from businesses acquired or exited in the preceding 12 months. After an acquired business has been part of our consolidated results for 12 months, the change in net sales thereafter is considered part of the increase or decrease in organic net sales.
Inflation
Our revenues and margins are dependent on various economic factors, including rates of inflation, energy costs, consumer attitudes toward discretionary spending, currency fluctuations, and other macro-economic factors which may impact levels of consumer spending. In fiscal years 2020 through 2022, we have been adversely impacted by rising input costs related to inflation, particularly relating to grain and seed prices, fuel prices and the ingredients used in our garden controls and fertilizer business as well as heightened import costs such as shipping container costs and tariffs. Although our gross and operating margins increased in fiscal 2022, rising costs are making it difficult for us to further increase prices to our customers at a pace sufficient for us to maintain our margins.
In fiscal 2022, we continued to experience increasing inflationary pressure, including notable increases in costs for key commodities, materials, labor and freight. During fiscal 2021, inflation was broad-based and we saw significant increases across commodity and material costs, freight and labor. During fiscal 2020, we saw more moderate increases to commodity, labor and freight costs.
Weather and Seasonality
Our sales of lawn and garden products are influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve. Our Garden segment’s business is highly seasonal. In fiscal 2022, approximately 66% of our Garden segment’s net sales and 59% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment’s operating income is typically generated in this period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have financed our growth through a combination of internally generated funds, bank borrowings, supplier credit, and sales of equity and debt securities to the public.
Our business is seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern. Generally, during the first fiscal quarter, accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory, accounts payable and short-term borrowings begin to increase. During the second fiscal quarter, receivables, accounts payable and short-term borrowings increase, reflecting the build-up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season. During the third fiscal quarter, inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short-term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season. During the fourth fiscal quarter, inventory levels are at their lowest, and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash.
We service two broad markets: pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies. Our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year-round selling cycle with a slight degree of seasonality. As a result, it is not necessary to maintain large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands. Our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately 66% of our Garden segment’s net sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality requires the shipment of large quantities of product well ahead of the peak consumer buying periods. To encourage retailers and distributors to stock large quantities of inventory, industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and/or promotional discounts.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities increased $284.8 million, from $250.8 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 to $34.0 million of cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2022. The increase in cash used was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, primarily an increase in inventory, driven in part by higher costs of inventory in this inflationary environment as well as management's decision to increase inventory levels to help improve fill rates and customer service adversely impacted by a challenged supply chain.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $13.5 million, from $264.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $250.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, primarily an increase in inventory from an intentional build-up due to the overall increased demand for our products, as compared to fiscal 2020.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $756.4 million from $899.4 million in fiscal 2021 to $143.0 million in fiscal 2022. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of approximately $35 million in the current year compared to the prior year and increased investments in the current year compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2021, we acquired DoMyOwn for approximately $81 million, Hopewell Nursery for approximately $81 million, Green Garden Products for approximately $571 million and D&D Commodities for approximately $88 million.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $851.3 million from $48.1 million in fiscal 2020 to $899.4 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to acquisition activity and an increase in capital expenditures of approximately $37 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of our Breeder's Choice business during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and decreased investments in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired DoMyOwn for approximately $81 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Hopewell Nursery for approximately $81 million and Green Garden Products for approximately $571 million and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired D&D Commodities for approximately $88 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities increased $487.3 million from $420.5 million of cash provided in fiscal 2021 to $66.8 million of cash used in fiscal 2022. The increase in cash used by financing activities during the current year was due primarily to our prior year issuance of $500 million of our 2030 Notes in October 2020 and $400 million of our 2031 Notes in April 2021, partially offset by the prior year repayment of our 2023 Notes and the corresponding premium paid on extinguishment as well as debt issuance costs incurred on the issuances of the 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes. We also increased open market purchases of our common stock during the current year period as compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $56.2 million, or $40.79 per share, and approximately 39,000 shares of our voting common stock (CENT) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $1.6 million, or $39.72 per share, in addition to $5.4 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $481.0 million from $60.6 million of cash used in fiscal 2020 to $420.5 million cash provided in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 was due primarily to the issuance of $500 million of our 2030 Notes in October 2020 and $400 million of our 2031 Notes in April 2021, partially offset by the repayment of our 2023
Notes and the corresponding premium paid on extinguishment as well as debt issuance costs incurred on the issuances of the 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes. We also decreased open market purchases of our common stock during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $21.8 million, or $41.91 per share, in addition to $8.2 million used for minimum statutory tax withholdings related to the net share settlement of our stock.
We expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations, proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, and, if necessary, borrowings under our $750 million asset backed loan facility. Based on our anticipated cash needs, availability under our asset backed loan facility and the scheduled maturity of our debt, we believe that our sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet our working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that these sources will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity and, should we require it, that we will be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.
We anticipate that our capital expenditures, which are related primarily to replacements and expansion of and upgrades to plant and equipment and also investment in our continued implementation of a scalable enterprise-wide information technology platform, will be approximately $70 million - $80 million over the next 12 months.
As part of our growth strategy, we have acquired a large number of businesses in the past, and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates in the future. If one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, become available in the near future, we may require additional external capital. In addition, such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies, particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large.
Stock Repurchases
During fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $56.2 million, or $40.79 per share, and approximately 39,000 shares of our voting common stock (CENT) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $1.6 million, or $39.72 per share. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock (the "2019 Repurchase Authorization"). The 2019 Repurchase Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 24, 2022, no repurchases had been made under the $100 million 2019 Repurchase Authorization.
In February 2019, the Board of Directors authorized us to make supplemental purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under our equity compensation plans (the "Equity Dilution Authorization"). In addition to our regular share repurchase program, we are permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or stock options granted in the prior fiscal year, to the extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 25, 2022, we had authorization remaining to repurchase up to 0.1 million shares under our Equity Dilution Authorization.
Total Debt
At September 24, 2022, our total debt outstanding was $1,186.6 million versus $1,185.8 million at September 25, 2021.
Senior Notes
Issuance of $400 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2031
In April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031 (the "2031 Notes"). We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes.
We incurred approximately $6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this issuance, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2031 Notes.
The 2031 Notes require semi-annual interest payments on April 30 and October 30. The 2031 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our Amended Credit Facility. The 2031 Notes were issued in a private placement under Rule 144A and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
We may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at anytime, at our option, prior to April 30, 2026, at the principal amount plus a "make whole" premium. At any time prior to April 30, 2024, we may also redeem, at our option, up to 40% of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at
our option, at any time on or after April 30, 2026 for 102.063%, on or after April 30, 2027 for 101.375%, on or after April 30, 2028 for 100.688% and on or after April 30, 2029 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The holders of the 2031 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2031 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control.
The 2031 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 24, 2022.
Issuance of $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 and Redemption of $400 million 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023
In October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 (the "2030 Notes"). In November 2020, we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due November 2023 (the "2023 Notes") at a redemption price of 101.531% plus accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes.
We incurred approximately $8.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes.
As a result of our redemption of the 2023 Notes, we incurred a call premium payment of $6.1 million, overlapping interest expense for 30 days of approximately $1.4 million and a $2.5 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2023 Notes. These amounts are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
The 2030 Notes require semiannual interest payments on October 15 and April 15, which commenced April 15, 2021. The 2030 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or guarantee our other debt.
We may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes at anytime, at our option, prior to October 15, 2025, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a “make-whole” premium. Prior to October 15, 2023, we may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount of the notes. We may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2025 for 102.063%, on or after October 15, 2026 for 101.375%, on or after October 15, 2027 for 100.688% and on or after October 15, 2028 for 100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The holders of the 2030 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.
The 2030 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 24, 2022.
$300 Million, 5.125% Senior Notes due 2028
On December 14, 2017, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2028 (the "2028 Notes"). We used the net proceeds from the offering to finance acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.
We incurred approximately $4.6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2028 notes.
The 2028 Notes require semiannual interest payments on February 1 and August 1. The 2028 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries who are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility or who guarantee the 2023 Notes.
We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at anytime, at our option, prior to January 1, 2023 at the principal amount plus a "make whole" premium. We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at our option, at any time on or after January 1, 2023 for 102.563% on or after January 1, 2024 for 101.708%, on or after January 1, 2025 for 100.854% and on or after January 1, 2026 for 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.
The 2028 Notes contain customary high-yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 24, 2022.
Asset-Based Loan Facility Amendment
On December 16, 2021, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated the previous credit agreement dated September 27, 2019 (the "Predecessor Credit Agreement"), and provides for a $750 million principal amount senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, with up to an additional $400 million principal amount available with the consent of the Lenders, as defined, if we exercise the uncommitted accordion feature set forth therein (collectively, the “Amended Credit Facility”). The Amended Credit Facility matures on December 16, 2026. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Amended Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility must be repaid in full.
The Amended Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated using a formula based upon eligible receivables and inventory, and at our election, eligible real property, minus certain reserves. We did not draw down any commitments under the Amended Credit Facility upon closing. Proceeds of the Amended Credit Facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Net availability under the Amended Credit Facility was approximately $517 million as of September 24, 2022. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $75 million sublimit for short-notice borrowings. As of September 24, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding and no letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility. Outside of the Amended Credit Facility, there were other letters of credit of $1.3 million outstanding as of September 24, 2022.
Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest at an index based on LIBOR (which will not be less than 0.00%) or, at our option, the Base Rate, plus, in either case, an applicable margin based on our usage under the credit facility. Base Rate is defined as the highest of (a) the Truist prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% and (d) 0.00%. The applicable margin for LIBOR-based borrowings fluctuates between 1.00%-1.50%, and was 1.0% as of September 24, 2022, and the applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings fluctuates between 0.00%-0.50%, and was 0.00% as of September 24, 2022. An unused line fee shall be payable quarterly in respect of the total amount of the unutilized Lenders’ commitments and short-notice borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. Letter of credit fees at the applicable margin on the average undrawn and unreimbursed amount of letters of credit shall be payable quarterly and a facing fee of 0.125% shall be payable quarterly for the stated amount of each letter of credit. We are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Amended Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility provides for the transition from LIBOR to Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and does not require an amendment in connection with such transition. As of September 24, 2022, the applicable interest rate related to Base Rate borrowings was 6.3%, and the applicable interest rate related to one-month LIBOR-based borrowings was 4.1%.
We incurred approximately $2.4 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included lender fees and legal expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the Amended Credit Facility.
The Amended Credit Facility continues to contain customary covenants, including financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 upon triggered quarterly testing (e.g. when availability falls below certain thresholds established in the agreement), reporting requirements and events of default. The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the borrowing parties, including (i) pledges of 100% of the stock or other equity interest of each domestic subsidiary that is directly owned by such entity and (ii) 65% of the stock or other equity interest of each foreign subsidiary that is directly owned by such entity, in each case subject to customary exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Amended Credit Facility as of September 24, 2022.
Summarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities
Central (the "Parent/Issuer") issued $400 million of 2031 Notes in April 2021, $500 million of 2030 Notes in October 2020, and $300 million of 2028 Notes in December 2017. The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") which are guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are unsecured senior obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt, including our Amended Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to make distributions to the Parent/Issuer. Certain subsidiaries and operating divisions of the Company do not guarantee the 2031, 2030 or 2028 Notes and are referred to as the Non-Guarantors.
The Guarantors jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantee the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes when due, whether at stated maturity of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes and to the trustee under the indenture governing the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes (the "Guarantee"). The Guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and are of equal rank with all other existing and future senior indebtedness of the Guarantors.
The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in
respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under the guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under Federal or state law.
The Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:
(1) upon any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), in accordance with the governing indentures, to any person other than the Company;
(2) if such Guarantor merges with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger;
(3) if the Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or
(4) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option or the discharge of the Company's obligations under the indentures in accordance with the terms of the indentures.
The following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent/Issuer subsidiaries and the Guarantor subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries under Parent/Issuer and subsidiaries under the Guarantor have been eliminated. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Parent/Issuer's interests in the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized information excludes financial information of the Non-Guarantors, including earnings from and investments in these entities.
Contractual Obligations
The table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year:
(1)Excludes $1.3 million of outstanding letters of credit related to normal business transactions. Debt repayments do not reflect the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs associated with the 2028 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes of approximately $14.1 million as of September 24, 2022, of which, $2.5 million is amortizable until February 2028, $6.4 million is amortizable until October 2030 and $5.2 million is amortizable until April 2031, and is included in the carrying value of the long-term debt. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of long-term debt.
(2)Estimated interest payments to be made on our 2028 Notes, our 2030 Notes and our 2031 Notes. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for description of interest rate terms.
(3)Contracts for purchases of grains, grass seed and pet food ingredients, used primarily to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability, may obligate us to make future purchases based on estimated yields. The terms of these contracts vary; some having fixed prices or quantities, others having variable pricing and quantities. For certain agreements, management estimates are used to develop the quantities and pricing for anticipated purchases, and future purchases could vary significantly from such estimates.
(4)Possible performance-based payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses are not included in the above table, because they are based on future performance of the businesses acquired, which is not yet known. Performance-based payments of approximately $0.2 million were made in fiscal 2022 related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Potential performance-based periods extend through fiscal 2025 for Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Payments are capped at $1.0 million per year related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are required for, but are not limited to, accounts receivable and inventory realizable values, fixed asset lives, long-lived asset valuation and impairments, intangible asset lives, stock-based compensation, deferred and current income taxes, self-insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Although not all inclusive, we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment.
We test goodwill for impairment annually (as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments and historical performance. If it is determined that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. Based on certain circumstances, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying values, including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of our two reporting units to the Company’s total market capitalization.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were: (i) discount rates used in determining the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) estimated future cash flows; and (iii) projected revenue and operating profit growth rates used in the reporting unit models. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors.
Our goodwill is associated with our Pet segment and our Garden segment. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the estimated fair values of our reporting units under the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and it was determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts, and accordingly, no quantitative testing of goodwill was required.
Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rates, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in additional impairment of goodwill.
Intangible assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life if its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Future net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for trade names based on management’s forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes and general economic factors such as consumer spending.
During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and market growth or decline estimates for future years. No impairment was indicated during our fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 analyses of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks.
Acquisitions
In connection with businesses we acquire, management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts, particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets, and the applicable useful lives related thereto. Under different assumptions, the resulting valuations could be materially different, which could materially impact the operating results we report.
Our contractual commitments are presented under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.
