ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as information relating to the plans of our current management. This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “continue,” and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
While our financial statements are presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our auditors have raised a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
THE COMPANY
Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was originally incorporated as Newmarkt Corp. on July 17, 2015, under the laws of the State of Nevada.
On December 11, 2020, the Company formed Ozop Energy Systems, Inc. (“OES”), a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OES was formed to be a manufacturer and distributor of renewable energy products.
On October 29, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Ozop Surgical Name Change Subsidiary, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Sub was formed under the Nevada Revised Statutes for the sole purpose and effect of changing the Company’s name to “Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc.” That same day the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with the Merger Sub and filed Articles of Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) with the Nevada Secretary of State, merging the Merger Sub into the Company, which were stamped effective as of November 3, 2020. As permitted by the Section 92.A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose and effect of the filing of Articles of Merger was to change the name of the Company from Ozop Surgical Corp. to “Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc.”
On August 19, 2021, the Company formed Ozop Capital Partners, Inc. (“Ozop Capital”), a Delaware corporation. The Company is the majority shareholder of Ozop Capital with PJN Holdings LLC, a New York limited liability company, being the minority shareholder. Ozop Capital was formed as a holding company and seeks to develop a captive insurance company. Brian Conway was appointed as the sole officer and director of Ozop Capital and has voting control of Ozop Capital.
On October 29, 2021, EV Insurance Company, Inc. (“EVCO”) was formed as a captive insurance company in the State of Delaware. EVCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ozop Capital. On January 7, 2022, EVCO filed with New Castle County, Delaware DBA OZOP Plus.
Stock Purchase Agreement
On July 10, 2020, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Power Conversion Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“PCTI”), and Catherine Chis (“Chis”), PCTI’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and its sole shareholder. Under the terms of the SPA, the Company acquired one thousand (1,000) shares of PCTI, which represents all of the outstanding shares of PCTI, from Chis in exchange for the issuance of 47,500 shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, 18,667 shares of the Company’s Series D Preferred Stock, and 500 shares of the Company’s Series E Preferred Stock to Chis. The Acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination and was treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting purposes with PCTI as the accounting acquirer in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). In accordance with the accounting treatment for a reverse acquisition, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger were and will be replaced with the historical financial statements of PCTI prior to the reverse merger, in all future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger have and will include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger.
The Company utilized the Option Pricing Method (the “OPM”) to value the transaction. The OPM method treats all equity linked instruments as call options on the enterprise value, with exercise prices and liquidation preferences based on the terms of the various common, preferred, options, warrants, and convertible debt. Under this method, the common stock only has value if the funds available for distribution to the shareholders exceed the liquidation preferences of the preferred stock and face value of the convertible debt. The timing of a liquidity event is required to utilize this method. The OPM considers the various terms of the stockholder agreements-including the level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations-upon liquidation of the enterprise. In addition, the method implicitly considers the effect of the liquidation preference as of the future liquidation date, not as of the valuation date. A feature of the OPM is that it explicitly recognizes the option-like payoffs of the various share classes utilizing information in the underlying asset (that is, estimated volatility) and the risk-free rate to adjust for risk by adjusting the probabilities of future payoffs. The following table summarizes the preliminary value of the consideration issued and the preliminary purchase price allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction.
The Company reviews the goodwill allocated to each of our reporting units for possible impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Pursuant to that review, management has determined that the goodwill arising from the above transaction has been impaired and accordingly $11,201,145 has been recorded as an impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Included in the audited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the years ended December 31, 2020, are the results of Ozop, the accounting acquiree, of revenues of $-0- and a loss before income taxes of $7,782,364. The following table provides unaudited pro forma results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as if the acquisition had been consummated as of the beginning of that period. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments, such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings (if any) of the combined companies. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition has occurred on the date indicated, or which may occur in the future.
Stock Redemption Agreement
On July 13, 2021, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Chis to purchase the 47,500 shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock held by Chis and the 18,667 shares of the Company’s Series D Preferred Stock held by Chis for the total purchase price of $11,250,000.
Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The following discussion relates to the historical financial statements of PCTI, and beginning on July 11, 2020 the consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of PCTI and Ozop, (the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger).
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated revenue of $11,928,605 compared to $1,411,432 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenues is a result of revenues of $10,595,799 from Ozop Energy Systems, beginning May 2021, and are classified as sourced and distributed products. Sales are summarized as follows:
Cost of sales
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized $10,342,413 and $1,404,348, respectively, of cost of sales.
Based on the above cost of sales, gross margin was 13.3% and 0.5% for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase of gross margin for the current year is a result of the manufactured orders shipped in 2021 were at a higher margin than the manufactured orders were in 2020. While the improved margin was partially offset by the lower margins recognized on the sourced and distributed products, gross profit dollars increased from the sale of the sourced and distributed products. The sourced and distributed margins were approximately 7.9% for 2021. Due to product availability, increased buy prices and delivery issues that the solar industry experienced at the end of the 4th quarter 2021, and into the first quarter of 2022, the Company expects that margins on sourced products may be temporarily reduced at the beginning of 2022. However, the Company anticipates that margins of sourced products will rise during the remainder of 2022. While the overall margin will be reduced, the higher gross profit dollars generated from the higher sourced and distributed products revenues will benefit the Company.
Operating expenses
Total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, were $14,387,941 and $17,585,427, respectively. The operating expenses were comprised of:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the above amounts include expenses incurred by PCTI for the year ended December 31, 2020, and expenses incurred by Ozop for the period July 11, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
Wages and management fees- related parties, include amounts paid to our CEO and to the President (resigned July 2021) of PCTI. The CEO is eligible for additional bonuses as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. Beginning January 1, 2021, the CEO was compensated $20,000 per month and effective September 1, 2021, an additional $10,000 per month for the management of Ozop Capital. The following table summarizes management fees:

The increase in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily a result of loss on extinguishment of debt related to the market value of shares of common stock issued in excess of the debt and accrued interest extinguished.

The increase in the loss was primarily a result of the increase in other expenses of $179,111,412 described above partially offset by lower operating expenses and the increase in gross profit.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Currently, our current capital and our other existing resources will be sufficient to provide the working capital needed for our current business, however, additional capital will be required to meet our debt obligations, and to further expand our business. We may be unable to obtain the additional capital required. If we are unable to generate capital or raise additional funds when required it will have a negative impact on our business development and financial results. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as well as our recurring losses from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations. This “going concern” could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities. Management’s plans in regard to these factors are discussed below and also in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements filed herein.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we primarily funded our business operations with $15,000,000 of proceeds received pursuant to the issuances of promissory notes and $13,100,000 received from the Series D SPA (see Note 13 to the financial statements filed herein). Of the proceeds, $5,000,000 was used for the redemption of 5,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock and $11,250,000 was used for the redemption of Chis’s Series C and Series D Preferred Stock (see Note 11 to the financial statements filed herein).
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $6,767,167 as compared to $1,808,476 at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had current liabilities of $38,385,016 (including $20,966,701 of non-cash derivative liabilities), compared to current assets of $10,159,108, which resulted in a working capital deficit of $28,225,908. The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible debt, derivative liabilities, customer deposits, lease obligations and notes payable.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged. Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Management expects that its business will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.
Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $6,368,006 compared to $1,811,816 for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of $195,303,051, adjusted by loss on debt extinguishment of $95,499,996, non- cash interest expense of $51,492,115 (including $38,907,939 for the initial fair value of the 375,000,000 warrants issued), losses on the fair value changes in derivatives related to warrants and convertible notes of $17,349,075, debt restructuring costs of $16,450,000, stock-based compensation of $9,322,751 and the non-cash expenses of interest and amortization and depreciation of $189,348. Net changes of $1,318,240 in operating assets and liabilities increased the cash used in operating activities, primarily as a result of the start-up of the Company’s California operations in the support of inventory and accounts receivable.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of $20,968.243, adjusted by impairment charges of $11,526,303, stock-based compensation of $4,286,647, the non-cash expenses of interest and amortization and depreciation of $2,984,251 and losses on the fair value changes in derivatives of $176,050. Net changes of $378,729 in operating assets and liabilities and a gain on extinguishment of debt of $195,553 reduced the cash used in operating activities.
Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was $116,836, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $424.431 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net cash provided by financing activities was $11,443,533, compared to $3,168,487 for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $15,000,000 of proceeds from the issuances of $16,610,000 face value of promissory notes and $13,100,000 (net of costs) from the Series D SPA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 47,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 18,667 shares of Series D Preferred Stock from Chis for $11,250,000, redeemed 5,000 shares of the Series E Preferred Stock for $5,000,000, and repaid $392,833 of notes payable and $13,634 to shareholders.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received proceeds of $750,000 pursuant to an obligation to pay a perpetual 1.8% (as amended) fee of revenues, $489,000 of proceeds from the issuances of convertible note financings, $1,553,000 from the issuances of promissory notes, $400,000 advance from affiliate, $100,400 from the Payroll Protection Program and $42,420 from shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repaid $101,864 of principal of convertible notes and notes payable and $74,470 to shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are described in more details in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgement and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and PCTI and the Company’s other wholly owned subsidiaries Ozop Energy Systems, Inc., Ozop LLC, Ozop HK and Spinus, LLC (“Spinus”), and the Company’s majority owned subsidiary Ozop Capital Partners, Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent purchased patent and license rights. The Company amortizes these costs over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its estimated economic life using the straight-line method. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. There was no impact on the Company’s financial statements as a result of adopting Topic 606 for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share.” ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible notes and stock warrants, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options, warrants and conversion of convertible notes. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.
