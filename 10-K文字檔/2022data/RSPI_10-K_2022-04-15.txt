Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this document.
Overview
The mission of the Company is to develop innovative and revolutionary treatments to combat disorders caused by disruption of neuronal signaling. We are developing treatment options that address obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), epilepsy, acute and chronic pain, including inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and recovery from spinal cord injury (“SCI”), which are conditions that affect millions of people but for which there are limited or poor treatment options. We are also considering developing treatment options for other conditions based on results of preclinical and clinical studies to date.
RespireRx is developing a pipeline of new drug products supported by our broad patent portfolios across two distinct drug platforms:
(i) ResolutionRx, our pharmaceutical cannabinoids platform (which we refer to as ResolutionRx) is developing compounds that target the body’s endocannabinoid system, and in particular, the re-purposing of dronabinol, an endocannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist, for the treatment of OSA. Dronabinol is already approved by the FDA for other indications.
(ii) EndeavourRx, our neuromodulators platform is made up of two programs: (a) our AMPAkines program, which is developing proprietary compounds that act as positive allosteric modulators (“PAMs”) of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to promote neuronal function and (b) our GABAkines program, which is developing proprietary compounds that act as PAMs of GABAA receptors, and which was recently established pursuant to our entry into a patent license agreement (the “UWMRF Patent License Agreement”) with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Research Foundation, Inc., an affiliate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (“UWMRF”), into a patent license agreement.
Management intends to organize our ResolutionRx and EndeavourRx business units into two subsidiaries: (i) a ResolutionRx subsidiary, into which we would contribute our pharmaceutical cannabinoid platform and its related tangible and intangible assets and certain of its liabilities and (ii) an EndeavourRx subsidiary, into which we would contribute our neuromodulator platform, including both the AMPAkine and GABAkine programs and their related tangible and intangible assets and certain of their liabilities.
Management believes that there are advantages to separating these platforms formally into newly formed subsidiaries, including but not limited to optimizing their asset values through separate financing channels and making them more attractive for capital raising as well as for strategic transactions.
Financing our Platforms
Our major challenge has been to raise substantial equity or equity-linked financing to support research and development plans for our cannabinoid and neuromodulator platforms, while minimizing the dilutive effect to pre-existing stockholders. At present, we believe that we are hindered primarily by our public corporate structure, our OTCQB listing, and low market capitalization as a result of our low stock price.
The Company is also engaged in business development efforts (licensing/sub-licensing, joint venture and other commercial structures) with a view to securing strategic partnerships that represent strategic and operational infrastructure additions, as well as cash and in-kind funding opportunities. These efforts have focused on, but have not been limited to, transacting with brand and generic pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies as well as companies with potentially useful formulation or manufacturing capabilities, significant subject matter expertise and financial resources. No assurance can be given that any transaction will come to fruition and that if it does, that the terms will be favourable to the Company.
We filed a Form 1-A with the SEC, which was qualified on December 13, 2021 that may enable the Company to raise finance via a Regulation A Offering “Reg A Offering.” We provide no assurance that although qualified, the Company would complete any financing on terms as to price per share or other securities offered, amount of funds raised or other terms acceptable to the Company or at all. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not completed any closings of financings pursuant to the Reg A Offering.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, included with this report.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.
The Company’s research and development efforts and potential products rely on licenses from research institutions and if the Company loses access to these technologies or applications, its business could be substantially impaired.
Through the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to the 2007 License Agreement that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The 2007 License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. The 2007 License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 and on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 License Agreement with the University of Illinois, the material terms of which were similar to the 2007 License Agreement that had been terminated and also included the assignment of rights to the University of Illinois, to certain patent applications filed by RespireRx.
The Company received an extension of time to make a $100,000 payment that would have been due on December 31, 2021. The payment date has been extended to April 30, 2022. (See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies - Significant Agreements and Contracts - University of Illinois 2014 Exclusive License Agreement in notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, included with this report).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
SEC guidance defines Critical Accounting Estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operation of the registrant. These items require the application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current and projected economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates, assumptions and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below. See Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 for additional disclosures regarding our significant accounting policies.
Stock-Based Compensation and Awards
The Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors and consultants for services rendered. Such issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant.
The Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers, directors, outside consultants and vendors by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis in the Company’s consolidated financial statements over the vesting period of the awards.
The fair value of stock options granted as stock-based payments is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk- free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock.
Stock grants, which are sometimes subject to time-based vesting, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period.
Stock options and warrants issued to non-employees as compensation for services to be provided to the Company or in settlement of debt are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair value of the stock option or warrant, whichever can be more clearly determined. Management uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options and warrants issued by the Company. The Company recognizes this expense over the period in which the services are provided.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and outside service providers and organizations (including research institutes at universities) and other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development and testing of the Company’s treatments and product candidates. Research and development costs include salaries of our officers who also perform administrative duties for the Company. Management makes an allocation of those salaries to research and development based on estimates of time spent on those activities.
Research and development costs incurred by the Company under research grants are expensed as incurred over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the terms of the contract indicate that a different expensing schedule is more appropriate.
The Company reviews the status of its research and development contracts on a quarterly basis.
License Agreements
Obligations incurred with respect to mandatory payments provided for in license agreements are recognized ratably over the appropriate period, as specified in the underlying license agreement, and are recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Obligations incurred with respect to milestone payments provided for in license agreements are recognized when it is probable that such milestone will be reached and are recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Payments of such liabilities are made in the ordinary course of business.
Patent Costs
Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on the Company’s research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal and filing fees, are expensed as incurred and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are charged to general and administrative expenses.
Results of Operations
The Company’s consolidated statements of operations as discussed herein are presented below.
Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no revenues.
General and Administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses were $1,857,085, a decrease of $819,775, as compared to $2,676,860 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Stock-based compensation costs and fees included in general and administrative expenses were $28,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $345,500 for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting a decrease of $317,500. The decrease is the result of lesser number of stock option grants to general and administrative employees and consultants and service providers of the Company during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Legal fees for general corporate purposes were $250,950 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $859,258 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $608,308 related to reduced utilization of legal services for general, non-financing related corporate matters. Legal fees associated with our filing of a Form 1-A offering statement and having it become qualified have been recorded as a deferred financing cost, a current asset, on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 until such time the financing is consummated. No closings have occurred with respect to this offering pursuant to Regulation A through December 31, 2021 or through the date of this 2021 Form 10-K as the offering price of $0.02 per share is currently and has been since the date of the qualification of the offering, above the current market price of the Company’s Common Stock. In addition there were decreases in investor relations expenses of $23,178 and conversion fees associated with conversions from debt to equity of $24,562, respectively. There were additional smaller decreases totaling an aggregate of $28,352 from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021 in various other expense categories. The above decreases are offset by increases in several other expense categories. Salaries and benefits included in general and administrative expenses were $911,521 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $743,391 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $168,130. The increase is primarily due to engagement of Timothy Jones as CEO and President commencing on May 6, 2020 and the accrual of salary and scheduled bonuses. Legal fees for patents and other patent expenses included in general and administrative expenses were $137,229 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $76,687 as compared to $213,916 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in legal fees associated with patents and other patent costs is a result of a decrease in patent related activities.
Research and Development. For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expenses were $702,043, an increase of $63,768 as compared to $638,275 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily associated with the development of new proprietary dronabinol formulations and the production of active pharmaceutical ingredient in anticipation of the commencement of additional preclinical studies in our GABAkines program.
Gain or Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and other Liabilities in Exchange for Equity. The gain on extinguishment of debt or other liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $62,548 as compared to a loss of $389,902 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 gain is attributable to a settlement agreement with a vendor resulting in the Company recording a gain. The loss in 2020 was a result of the exchange of equity for debt with respect to exchange agreements and settlement of certain accounts payable to a single vendor with the settlement paid with Series H Preferred Stock.
Interest Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense was $724,769 (including $12,289 to related parties), an increase of $179,094, as compared to $545,675 (including $11,329 to related parties) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from interest on new convertible notes issued in February, March, April, May, August, October and December 2021 totaling $956,500 of principal amount in 2021, offset by maturity and repayment by conversion in whole or in part of four convertible notes during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 aggregating principal amounts of $317,500. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of note discounts.
Foreign Currency Transaction Gain. The foreign currency transaction gain was $75,410 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to a foreign currency transaction loss of $50,499 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The foreign currency transaction loss or gain relates to the $399,774 loan from SY Corporation Co., Ltd., formerly known as Samyang Optics Co. Ltd. (“SY Corporation”), made in June 2012, which is denominated in the South Korean Won.
Net Loss. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,144,840 and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3,522,882 (after deemed dividends), as compared to a net loss of $4,301,211 and a net loss attributable to commons shareholders of $5,741,425 (after deemed dividends) for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital and Cash
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses of $3,144,840 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and $4,301,211 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and negative operating cash flows of $956,172 and $513,001 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. The Company had a stockholders’ deficiency of $10,007,758 as of December 31, 2021 and expects to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. Additionally, the Company has, with respect to six convertible notes outstanding, $562,000 maturity amount plus accrued interest of $39,607 (as of December 31, 2021) maturing between April 22, 2022 and June 30, 2022, which must be paid, converted or otherwise have maturity dates extended in order to avoid a default on such convertible notes. In addition, the Company’s obligation to the University of Illinois of $100,000 that was due on December 31, 2021, was extended to and is due on April 30, 2022. In the past, the Company has been successful in getting maturity dates extended or having convertible note holders repaid via conversion. In addition, the Company has been successful in having license payment due dates extended and then meeting the payment obligations on such extended dates or further extended dates. There can be no assurance that the Company will remain successful in those efforts. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern (see “Going Concern” below).
At December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $9,713,758, as compared to a working capital deficit of $8,063,320 at December 31, 2020, reflecting an increase in the working capital deficit of $1,650,438 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is comprised of an increase in total current liabilities of $1,774,088, offset by an increase in current assets of $123,650. The increase in total current liabilities consists of a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $311,820, an increase in accrued compensation and related expenses of $1,067,899, an increase in convertible notes payable of $375,293, a decrease in the note payable to SY Corporation of $27,477 an increase in notes payable to officers and former officers of $35,946 and an increase in other short-term notes payable of $10,577.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash aggregating $1,398 as compared to $825 at December 31, 2020, reflecting an increase in cash of $573 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Operating Activities
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities utilized cash of $956,172 as compared to utilizing cash of $513,001 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, to support the Company’s ongoing operations and research and development activities.
Financing Activities
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities consisted of net proceeds from convertible note financings of $823,869 net of original issue discounts and note costs, sales of common stock pursuant to an equity line of $117,299 and $10,577 with respect to financing of a new directors and officers insurance policy and other insurance policies, net of repayments. In addition, there were net increases in advances from officers of $5,000.
On February 19, 2021, April 1, 2021, May 3, 2021, May 10, 2021, June 30, 2021, August 31, 2021 and October 7, 2021, the Company closed on financings, pursuant to which, seven convertible notes were issued to six separate investors, due in each case, except for the February 19, 2021 note, one year from the effective date (which for the each note was February 17, 2021, March 31, 2021, April 30, 2021, May 10, 2021, June 29, 2021, August 31, 2021, and October 7, 2021 respectively), with maturity amounts of $112,000, $112,500, $150,000, $150,000, $115,000, 115,000 and $115,000, respectively. The February 17, 2021 note had an original maturity date nine months from the effective date, which had been extended to February 17, 2022 and extended again to June 17, 2022. In addition, the noteholder of the February 17, 2011 note received 2,000,000 commitment shares as consideration. The other noteholders received as consideration, warrants to purchase 2,400,000, 3,200,000, 3,200,000, 2,453,333, 5,750,000 and 5,750,000 shares of common stock, respectively, each exercisable for a period of five years at an exercise price of $0.02 per share. The August 31, 2021 issuance triggered the most-favored nation provisions of four notes already outstanding, resulting in the issuance of 15,121,667 additional warrants on September 7, 2021. As a result of the note issuances, the Company received net proceeds of $97,500, $96,750, $123,400, $123,400, $100,000, 103,500 and $103,500 respectively, for an aggregate of $748,050. The difference between the maturity amounts and the net proceeds were due to original issue discounts in all seven cases, investor legal fees in five cases and in two cases, broker fees. The seven notes are convertible at a fixed price of $0.02 per share and bear interest at 10% per year which interest is guaranteed regardless of prepayment. The Company has or had the right to prepay the notes during the first six months subject to prepayment premiums that range from 0% to 15% (100% to 115% of the maturity amount plus accrued interest and any default interest and similar costs).
On July 28, 2020, RespireRx issued a convertible note, as amended (“Commitment Note”) to a single investor pursuant to, and to induce the investor to enter into an equity purchase agreement (“EPA”) dated July 28, 2020. The Commitment Note had an initial face amount of $25,000 which was subsequently amended on September 30, 2020 to increase the maturity amount to $40,000 and extend the maturity date to July 28, 2021 and amended a second time on July 27, 2021 to increase the principal amount to $45,000 and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2021 and amended a third time to increase the principal amount to $53,000 and extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022. On March 15, 2021, RespireRx received a conversion notice pursuant to which the investor converted $25,000 of principal amount into 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2021 there was $28,000 of principal amount and $6,368 of accrued interest outstanding with respect to this Commitment Note. The additions to principal amount have been recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense.
On December 23, 2021, RespireRx entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”) pursuant to which the investor provided a sum of $78,300 ($75,820 after investor legal fees and finder’s fees) to RespireRx, in return for a convertible promissory note with a face amount of $87,000 (which difference in value as compared to the consideration is due to an original issue discount of $8,700), and 1,553,000 commitment shares. The note matures 120 days after the issue date unless extended by the Company to a date that is 180 days following the issue date. The note is convertible only in the event of a default as defined in the note. If an event of default occurs, the note is convertible at $0.02 per share of Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the NPA, on the 121st day following the issue date, if any event of default has occurred, the Company shall deliver one or more warrants exercisable into 4,785,000 shares of the Common Stock unless the Company properly extends the maturity date, at which time, upon the 181st day following the issuance of the note, if any event of default has occurred, the Company shall issue a warrant exercisable into 6,525,000 shares of Common Stock. The warrant or warrants if issued, will be exercisable for five years at an exercise price of $0.02 per share of Common Stock on a cash or cashless basis. In addition, and to induce investor to enter into the NPA, the Company has, pursuant to the NPA, granted to the investor, piggy-back registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) with respect to the Common Stock issuable pursuant to the NPA. The note obligates the Company to pay on the 120th day after the issue date, a principal amount of $87,000 together with interest at a rate equal to 10% per annum. The interest, is guaranteed and earned in full as of the effective date of the note. Any amount of principal or interest that is not paid by the maturity date would bear interest at the rate of 24% from the maturity date to the date it is paid. The conversion rights and warrant exercise rights become effective upon any event of default, provided that the conversion would not result in the investor beneficially owning more than 9.99% of the Company’s then outstanding Common Stock. At any time during the period beginning on the issuance date and ending on the date which is day immediately prior to the maturity date, the Company shall have the right, exercisable on not less than three (3) trading days prior written notice to the investor or other holder, of the note, to prepay the outstanding note (principal and accrued interest), in full by making a payment to the investor or other holder of an amount in cash equal to 110 (10% prepayment premium), multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of the note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of the note. To the extent a partial prepayment is made, the amount of principal and/or accrued but unpaid interest deemed prepaid, shall be 90.9090% of the amount paid and 9.0909% shall be deemed the 10% prepayment premium. While any portion of the note is outstanding, if the Company receives cash proceeds from a closing of an offering pursuant to Regulation A, the Company shall, within one (1) business day of the Company’s receipt of such proceeds, inform the holder, of such receipt, following which holder has the right to require the Company to immediately apply 10% or any lesser portion of such proceeds to repay all or any portion of the outstanding amounts owed under the note. In the event that such proceeds are received by holder prior to the maturity date, the required prepayment shall be subject to all prepayment terms in the note. The note also requires that the Company reserve the greater of (i) 16,312,500 shares of Common Stock or (ii) one and a half times the number of shares into which the note may convert. The warrant requires that the Company reserve one and a half times the number of shares into which the warrant is at any time exercisable. The NPA includes, among other things: (1) the grant of an option to the investor to incorporate into the note any terms applicable to a subsequent issuance of a convertible note or security by the Company that are more beneficial to an investor than the terms of the NPA and note are to the investor; and (2) certain registration rights which are included in the NPA and the right to have any shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the conversion of the note or exercise of the warrant included in any Regulation A offering statement that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the issue date.
The Company periodically issues convertible notes with similar characteristics. As described in the table below, as of December 31, 2021, there were nine such notes outstanding (including the convertible notes described in the paragraph above), two of which were satisfied in full by conversion of both principal and interest and one of which was satisfied in part, principal only, during that period. These notes all have or had a fixed conversion price of $0.02 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. All notes but one had an annual interest rate of 10% which was guaranteed in full. One note had an annual interest rate of 8%. The convertible notes had an original issue discount (“OID”), debt issuance costs (“DIC”) that were capitalized by the Company, a warrant (“WT”) or commitment shares (“CS”) and in three cases a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). The OID, DIC, WTs, CSs and BCF allocated values are amortized over the life of the notes to interest expense. All notes mature or matured nine to fifteen months from their issuance date. All notes were prepayable by the Company during the first six months, subject to prepayment premiums that range from 100% to 115% of the maturity amount plus accrued interest. If not earlier paid, the notes were convertible by the holder into the Company’s common stock. Two of the notes were paid before maturity.
We filed a Form 1-A with the SEC, which was qualified on December 13, 2021, that may enable the Company to raise capital via a Regulation A Offering (“Reg A Offering”). We provide no assurance that although qualified, the Company will complete any financing pursuant to the terms of the Reg A Offering or at all. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not completed any closings of financings pursuant to the Reg A Offering.
The Company may continue to engage in convertible note, non-convertible note, other note and debt financings, private placements of equity that are exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws rules and regulations, equity lines of credit, public offerings of securities and other forms of finance. The Company will continue to consider additional forms of debt, equity and strategic partner financing throughout 2021.
Going Concern
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses of $3,144,840 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and $4,301,211 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and negative operating cash flows of $956,172 and $513,001 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had a stockholders’ deficiency of $173,955,136 at December 31, 2021 and expects to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. Additionally, the Company has, with respect to six convertible notes outstanding, $562,000 maturity amount plus accrued interest of $39,607 (as of December 31, 2021) maturing between April 22, 2022 and June 30, 2022, which must be paid, converted or otherwise have maturity dates extended in order to avoid a default on such convertible notes. In addition, the Company’s obligation to the University of Illinois of $100,000 that was due on December 31, 2021, was extended to and is due on April 30, 2022. In the past, the Company has been successful in getting maturity dates extended or having convertible note holders repaid via conversion. In addition, the Company has been successful in having license payment due dates extended and then meeting the payment obligations on such extended dates or further extended dates. There can be no assurance that the Company will remain successful in those efforts. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is currently, and has for some time, been in significant financial distress. It has limited cash resources and current assets and has no ongoing source of sustainable revenue. Management is continuing to address various aspects of the Company’s operations and obligations, including, without limitation, debt obligations, financing requirements, intellectual property, licensing agreements, legal and patent matters and regulatory compliance, and has continued to raise new debt and equity capital to fund the Company’s business activities from both related and unrelated parties.
The Company is continuing its efforts to raise additional capital in order to be able to pay its liabilities and fund its business activities on a going forward basis, including the pursuit of the Company’s planned research and development activities. We filed a Form 1-A with the SEC, which was qualified on December 13, 2021 that may enable the Company to raise finance via Reg A Offering. We provide no assurance that although qualified, the Company would complete any financing on terms as to price per share or other securities offered, amount of funds raised or other terms acceptable to the Company or at all. To date the offering price has been greater than the market price of the Company’s Common Stock and therefore there have been no closings with respect to the Reg A Offering. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not completed any closings of financings pursuant to the Reg A Offering. The Company regularly evaluates various other measures to satisfy the Company’s liquidity needs, including development and other agreements with collaborative partners and, when necessary, seeking to exchange or restructure the Company’s outstanding securities. The Company is evaluating certain changes to its operations and structure to facilitating raising capital from sources that may be interested in financing only discrete aspects of the Company’s development programs. Such changes could include a significant reorganization, which may include the formation of one or more subsidiaries into which one or more programs may be contributed. As a result of the Company’s current financial situation, the Company has limited access to external sources of debt and equity financing. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing in the amounts necessary to fully fund its operating and debt service requirements. If the Company is unable to access sufficient cash resources, the Company may be forced to discontinue its operations entirely and liquidate.
