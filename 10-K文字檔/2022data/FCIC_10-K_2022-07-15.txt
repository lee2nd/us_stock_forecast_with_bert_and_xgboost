Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information.”
General
The Company has limited operations and is actively seeking merger, reverse merger, acquisition or business combination opportunities with an operating business or other financial transaction opportunities. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. Accordingly, during such period, the Company does not expect to achieve sufficient income to offset its operating expenses, resulting in operating losses that may require the Company to use and thereby reduce its cash balance. For further information on the Company’s plan of operation and business, see Item I, Current Business. Until the Company completes a merger, reverse merger or other financial transaction, and unless interest rates increase dramatically, the Company expects to continue to incur a loss of between $19,000 to $25,000 for the first quarter and thereafter of between $18,000 to $22,000 per quarter. The increase in first quarter expenses relates to a Company audit and tax return.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company had a loss from operations of $183,000. The loss is attributable to the operating, administrative and legal expenses incurred during the year. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the loss from operations was $62,000. The increase in the loss for the year ended March 31, 2022 is attributable to increases in legal, operating and administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Stockholders’ equity (deficit) as of March 31, 2022 was ($184,000), as compared to ($1,000) at March 31, 2021. The decrease is attributable to the operating loss incurred in 2022.
The Company had cash on hand at March 31, 2022 of $25,000, as compared to $66,000 at March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash on hand is attributable to additional expenses.
The Company does not have any arrangements with banks or financial institutions with respect to the availability of financing in the future.
The payment of any cash distribution or dividend is subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. At this time the Company has no plans to pay any cash distributions or dividends in the foreseeable future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the effect of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Critical accounting policies and Estimates
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820).” This standard modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement and is effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Implementation on a prospective or retrospective basis varies by specific disclosure requirement. The standard also allows for early adoption of any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance while delaying adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13 effective on January 1, 2020 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740)”. This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40)” (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in U.S. GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements.
