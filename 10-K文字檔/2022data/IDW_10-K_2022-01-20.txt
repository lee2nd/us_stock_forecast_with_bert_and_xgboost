The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management’s most subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill, valuation of long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives and ultimate revenues for television costs. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies.
Results of Operations
We evaluate the performance of our operating business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations. Accordingly, the income and expense line items below loss from operations are only included in our discussion of the consolidated results of operations.
IDWP
nm-not meaningful
The results of Clover Press were included in the IDWP segment from June 1, 2019, through March 31, 2020. As of April 1, 2020, Clover Press is no longer a consolidated entity and became a cost method investment.
Revenues. Revenues increased by $1.434,000 in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. IDWP revenue increased by $2,116,000 driven by several high-performing direct market titles, increased direct-to-consumer sales and from lower sales in fiscal 2020 due to the temporary halt of direct market sales as a result of COVID-19. Digital sales increased by $83,000 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to continued strong sales across all platforms. Sales returns and discounts decreased by $177,000 in the comparable periods. The foregoing positive impacts were partially offset by decreased games revenue of $556,000 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to fulfillment of a direct-to-consumer games campaign in fiscal 2020 and decreased licensing and royalty revenues of $255,000 primarily due to co-publishing royalty revenue in fiscal 2020. Additionally, Clover Press revenues decreased by $131,000 as they were not consolidated in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 while they were consolidated for a portion of fiscal 2020.
In October 2021, Hasbro informed us that effective March 2023, our licenses for the Transformers and GI Joe titles will be terminated. While the cancellation of the licenses for Transformers and GI Joe are anticipated to decrease revenues by approximately $1.2 million in fiscal year 2023, IDWP plans to mitigate the loss of revenue by enhancing its current key licensor brands. Additionally, revenues from originals editorial will begin to materialize in July 2022 with five to six new IDW original titles spanning fiscal 2022 and a planned output of doubling quantities each progressing fiscal year.
Direct cost of revenues. IDWP direct cost of revenues increased by $1,019,000 in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. IDWP direct cost of revenues consists primarily of printing expenses, costs of artists and writers, and royalties. Additionally, Clover Press direct cost of revenues decreased by $55,000 as they were not consolidated in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.
IDWP’s gross margin for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 decreased to 45.9% from 46.9% for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. The decrease is principally due to a one-time write-down of development costs related to projects no longer being pursued.
Selling, General and Administrative. IDWP’s selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,065,000 in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits of $587,000, severance of $463,000, overhead allocations of $420,000, consulting fees of $286,000, shipping and direct-to-consumer costs of $131,000, and other net changes of $57,000. These increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing expenses of $276,000, non-cash compensation of $189,000, and occupancy expenses of $98,000. Additionally, Clover Press consolidated selling, general, and administrative decreased by $316,000 as they were not consolidated in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.
As a percentage of IDWP’s revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, were 48.0% compared to 46.4% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.

Direct costs of revenues. Direct cost of revenues consists primarily of the amortization of production costs that were capitalized during the production of the television episodes and direct costs related to revenue recognized during related periods.
Direct costs of revenues for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 decreased by $8,766,000 compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. The amortized television costs for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, consisted of delivered episodes from Wynonna Earp of $5,251,000, Locke & Key season two of $48,000, cost refinement from October Faction and V Wars of $586,000 and impairment charges of $2,216,000.

Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $126,000 during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.

Consolidated
nm-not meaningful
Loss from operations. Loss from operations decreased by $639,000 in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, due to increased operating income from IDWE of $1,899,000 and decreased operating losses from IDWP of $667,000, partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead of $593,000. These changes are more fully described in the separate segment analyses below.
Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net increased in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, by $164,000 due to the interest income from the CRA tax credits.

Gain on sale of discontinued operations increased by $2,132,000 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, as a result of the sale of CTM.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
At October 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17,532,000 and working capital (current assets in excess of current liabilities) of $19,582,000.
We anticipate that our expected cash inflows from operations during the next twelve months together with our working capital, including the balance of cash and cash equivalents held as October 31, 2021, will be sufficient to sustain our next year of operations.
We satisfy our cash requirements primarily through cash provided by the Company’s financing and operating activities. As more fully discussed below, additional sources of financing will be needed to finance growth of IDWE.
Operating Activities
Our cash flow from operations varies from year to year, depending on our operating results and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, specifically trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Cash flows provided by operating activities was $10,637,000 and $15,989,000 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Some of this was attributed to IDWE for cash receipts of $300,000 and $804,000 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively for Dirk Gently, $4,000,000 received in fiscal 2020 for the delivery of Locke & Key season 1, $5,315,000 of tax credits received in fiscal 2021 related to V Wars and October Faction, and $232,000 and $439,000 received in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively for Wynonna Earp.
Investing Activities
Our capital expenditures were approximately $832,000 and $420,000 in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Financing Activities
During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021, and 2020, we repaid bank loans in the amounts of $14,204,000 and $26,559,000, respectively. In addition, the Company received PPP loans of $1,195,680 and $1,195,679, respectively related to IDW operations which were both forgiven during the year ended October 31, 2021. We received net cash proceeds of from issuance of Class B common stock in the year ended October 31, 2021, of $9,551,000 in connection to our registered public offering and in the year ended October 31, 2020, of $14,596,000 in connection to a private placement of Class B common stock.
Changes in Trade Accounts Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable decreased to approximately $5,431,000 at October 31, 2021, compared to $22,921,000 at October 31, 2020 principally due to changes in the accruals and collection of IDWE revenue, as well as the timing of receipts of payments of other receivable balances. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross trade accounts receivable was 2.28% at October 31, 2021 compared to 1.40% at October 31, 2020, reflecting the decrease in receivable balances and our collectible receivable experience.
Off- Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any “off-balance sheet arrangements,” as defined in relevant SEC regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Other Sources and Uses of Resources
On August 6, 2021, IDWMH closed a registered public offering of Class B common stock and EF Hutton, as representative of the Underwriters exercised the overallotment option included as part of the offering in full. The Company sold an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock for gross consideration of $10,350,000 less Underwriters commissions of $724,500 and Underwriters expenses of $75,000.
The Company is using the net proceeds we received from the offering for the following purposes: most heavily for the development of original IP and the purchase of associated publishing, media, and merchandise rights to be used across multiple platforms (e.g., print, television, new media) as well as supplemental IP acquisition and marketing spend for these newly created IP franchises; additionally for technology investment for our website, applications, data and business intelligence; talent investment as we look to expand our kids, middle grade, young adult, and family genres, and to further diversify into animation; and to pursue potential acqui-hire and/or bolt-on mergers and acquisition opportunities, should such opportunities arise.
We do not have any agreements at this time to potentially acquire other entities or businesses. The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. However, the nature, amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors. As a result, our management has and will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not immediately used for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing bank deposits or debt instruments.
Where appropriate, we evaluate strategic investments and acquisitions to complement, expand, and/or enter into new businesses. In considering acquisitions and investments, we search for opportunities to profitably grow our existing businesses, to add qualitatively to the range of businesses in our portfolio and to achieve operational synergies. At this time, we cannot guarantee that we will be presented with acquisition opportunities that meet our return-on-investment criteria, or that our efforts to make acquisitions that meet our criteria will be successful.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative financial impact on our business with regard to (a) the temporary closure of IDWP’s comic book distributor due to COVID-19 disruptions, and (b) production delays of IDWE’s television show Wynonna Earp. Its production schedule has been delayed which was a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic that had affected virtually the entire filmed entertainment industry. This production delay had negatively impacted the delivery, which in turn will pushed out our cash receipts.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we paid “pull down” costs pursuant to a previously announced, multi-year agreement with Cineflix related to international sales of Wynonna Earp. Specifically, under this agreement, IDWE purchased the distribution rights to seasons one and two of Wynonna Earp from the current licensor (Netflix) and has agreed to transfer those rights to Cineflix. Cineflix will be the international distributor of all four seasons of Wynonna Earp. Due to changes in competition as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cineflix deal is not expected to contribute as much as originally expected to IDWE’s revenue and operating cash flow in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 as originally anticipated at the inception of the deal.
Dividends
In light of the current growth initiatives of the Company, particularly the television property development of IDWE, the Board of Directors determined to continue the suspension of the payment of cash dividends. Projects that have already been approved and commenced are placing demands on the Company’s resources, and management and the Board determined that it was in the best interests of the stockholders to utilize available cash resources for investment in these promising and exciting growth opportunities. This position may continue depending on the timing of projects, the cash generation of the Company’s operations and any financing that the Company may consummate. Decisions as to the payment of dividends in future periods will depend on the financial position, results of operations, prospects and current and projected competing demands for cash resources at the relevant time. The Company continues its position of prudent and conservative cash management and is committed to using all of its resources to maximize shareholder value, balancing short, medium and long-term interests.
