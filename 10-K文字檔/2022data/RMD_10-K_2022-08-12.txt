ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.
We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including SDB, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based digital health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.
Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and other respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns.
We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2022, we invested $253.6 million on research and development activities, which represents 7.1% of net revenues with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. During fiscal year 2022 we continued the launch of AirSense 11, which introduces new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy and digital enhancements and over-the-air update capabilities. Due to multiple acquisitions, including Brightree in April 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst in July 2018 and MatrixCare in November 2018, and our pending acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN which is expected to close during fiscal year 2023 subject to regulatory clearances, our operations now include out-of-hospital software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our SaaS business. These products, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”).
Net revenue in fiscal year 2022 increased to $3,578.1 million, an increase of 12% compared to fiscal year 2021. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2022 to $2,024.3 million, from $1,839.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $185.2 million or 10%. Our net income for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $779.4 million or $5.30 per diluted share compared to net income of $474.5 million or $3.24 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2021. Unrecognized tax benefits as described at Note 13 - Income Taxes impacted our diluted earnings per share by $1.70 for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2022 was $351.1 million and at June 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $273.7 million. At June 30, 2022, our total assets were $5.1 billion and our stockholders’ equity was $3.4 billion. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share during fiscal 2022 with a total amount of $245.3 million paid to stockholders.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis”, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to fiscal year June 30, 2020, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report for the Year Ended June 30, 2021, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2021.
Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Our Business
Supply Chain Disruptions
The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact the global supply chain, primarily through a lack of availability of raw materials and electronic components. The lack of raw materials and electronic components is also impacting companies outside of our direct industry, which is resulting in a competitive supply environment causing higher costs, requiring us to commit to minimum purchase obligations as well as make upfront payments to our suppliers. Additionally, we have observed a reduction in both inbound and outbound transportation capacity as a result of port closures and delays associated with the pandemic, which is causing longer lead times in receiving raw materials into and distributing finished goods out of our manufacturing facilities, in addition to increased freight costs. These highly competitive and constrained supply chain conditions are increasing our cost of sales, which has and may continue to decrease our gross margin. Given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of constraint on our supply chain.
Competitor Recall
An ongoing product recall by one of our competitors, Philips, has resulted in increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices. The supply chain disruptions outlined above have constrained and restricted our ability to meet this increased demand and we expect these constraints will continue into the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
COVID-19
Although there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the global demand for ventilators and other respiratory support devices used to treat COVID-19 patients has largely been met. We did not observe material incremental demand for our ventilator devices and masks associated with the pandemic during the twelve months ended June 30, 2022.
In most markets, diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment, including physician practices, home medical equipment (“HME”) distributors, and sleep clinics have largely recovered towards pre-pandemic levels as vaccines and boosters roll out globally. Likewise, we have continued to observe stabilizing patient flow in our out-of-hospital care settings within our SaaS business.
Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees. We have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide as we progressively reopen our offices around the world. The pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity position.
Impact on Our Business
As a result of these trends, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market during the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. We are being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly semiconductor chips, and we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers. We have established an allocation process with clear

guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first.
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2021
Net Revenues
Net revenue for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased to $3,578.1 million from $3,196.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $381.3 million or 12% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). The following table summarizes our net revenue disaggregated by segment, product and region for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 (in thousands):
*Constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies.
Sleep and Respiratory Care
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased to $3,177.3 million from $2,823.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $354.1 million or 13%. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $43.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. Excluding the impact of currency movements, total net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by 14% compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic and increased demand following a recent product recall by one of our competitors, partially offset by decreased COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators.
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in the United States, Canada and Latin America for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased to $1,981.8 million from $1,705.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $276.7 million or 16%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic and increased demand following a recent product recall by one of our competitors, partially offset by decreased COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators.
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased for the year ended June 30, 2022 to $1,195.5 million from $1,118.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $77.4 million or 7% (an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis). The constant currency increase in sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including
PART II Item 7

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic, partially offset by decreased COVID-19-related demand for our ventilators.
Net revenue from devices for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased to $1,866.9 million from $1,610.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $256.9 million or 16%, including an increase of 24% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 7% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (a 10% increase on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by 17%.
Net revenue from masks and other for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased to $1,310.4 million from $1,213.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 8%, including an increase of 8% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 7% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (a 12% increase on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, masks and other sales increased by 9%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2021.
Software as a Service
Net revenue from our SaaS business for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $400.8 million, compared to $373.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $27.2 million or 7%. The increase was predominantly due to continued growth in our HME and Home Health and Hospice verticals, in addition to stabilizing patient flow in our Facilities vertical.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2022 to $2,024.3 million from $1,839.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $185.2 million or 10%. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, was 56.6% for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared with the 57.5% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher logistics and manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable changes in product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices, in addition to higher average selling prices.
Operating Expenses
The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2022 to $739.4 million from $670.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $69.0 million or 10%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in U.S. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $13.3 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by 12% compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 improved to 20.7% compared to 21.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021.
The constant currency increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2022 to $253.6 million from $225.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $28.3 million or 13%. Research and development expenses were favorably

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $3.0 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by 14% compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.1% for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to 7.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021.
The constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and SaaS solutions.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired intangible assets was consistent at $31.1 million for the years ended the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.
Restructuring Expenses
In November 2020, we closed our Portable Oxygen Concentrator business, which was part of the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized restructuring expenses of $13.9 million primarily related to inventory write-downs of $5.2 million, accelerated amortization of acquired intangible assets of $5.1 million, asset impairments of $2.3 million, employee-related costs of $0.7 million and contract cancellation costs of $0.6 million. Of the total expense recognized during the year ended June 30, 2021, the inventory write-down of $5.2 million is presented within cost of sales and the remaining $8.7 million in restructuring costs is separately disclosed as restructuring expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future.
Total Other Income (Loss), Net
The following table summarizes our other income (loss) (in thousands):
Total other income (loss), net for the year ended June 30, 2022 was a loss of $39.8 million, compared to a loss of $20.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in loss was primarily due to losses associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities, which were a loss of $12.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to a gain of $14.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. This was partially offset by lower losses attributable to equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2022 of $8.5 million compared to $11.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. Additionally, interest expense, net, decreased to $22.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $23.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 18.8% for the year ended June 30, 2022 from 46.3% for the year ended June 30, 2021. Our effective rate of 18.8% for the year ended June 30, 2022 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to research credits, foreign operations and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2022 was primarily related to the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits recorded in connection with the Australian Tax Office ("ATO") transfer pricing dispute, outlined below. Excluding the impact of the unrecognized tax benefit, our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2021 was 18.2%. The increase in our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the unrecognized tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2021, was due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2022.
PART II Item 7
RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
On September 19, 2021, we concluded the settlement agreement with the ATO in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 (“ATO settlement”). The ATO settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years, with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles.
The final net impact of the ATO settlement was $238.7 million, which represents a gross amount of $381.7 million, including interest and penalties of $48.1 million, and adjustments for credits and deductions of $143.0 million. As a result of the ATO settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies, we recorded a benefit of $14.1 million within other comprehensive income, and a $4.1 million reduction of tax credits, which was recorded to income tax expense. As a result of the ATO settlement, we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position.
On September 28, 2021, we remitted final payment to the ATO of $284.8 million, consisting of the agreed settlement amount of $381.7 million less prior remittances made to the ATO of $96.9 million.
Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated.
Net Income and Earnings per Share
As a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $779.4 million compared to net income of $474.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $5.30 compared to $3.24 for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 64%. Unrecognized tax benefits as described at Note 13 - Income Taxes reduced our diluted earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2021 by $1.70 per share.
Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The measure “non-GAAP cost of sales” is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and restructuring expense associated with inventory write-downs following the closure of the portable oxygen concentrator business. The measure “non-GAAP gross profit” is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and “non-GAAP gross margin” is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue.

These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except percentages):
The measure “non-GAAP income from operations” is equal to GAAP income from operations once adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and restructuring expense associated with the closure of the portable oxygen concentrator business. Non-GAAP income from operations is reconciled with GAAP income from operations below (in thousands):
The measure “non-GAAP net income” is equal to GAAP net income once adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles (net of tax), acquisition-related expenses, reserve for disputed tax positions, restructuring expenses (net of tax) and (gain) loss on equity investments. The measure “non-GAAP diluted earnings per share” is the ratio of non-GAAP net income to diluted shares outstanding. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except for per share amounts):

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and access to our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions, including our pending acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels.
As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $273.7 million and $295.3 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the United States at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 were $70.0 million and $106.7 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, were $203.7 million and $188.6 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
As of June 30, 2022, we had $1.4 billion available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $1.7 billion in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility.
We repatriated $100.0 million and $560.1 million to the United States during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the United States in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2023 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the United States, such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.
As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $126.9 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years; the additional tax expense associated with the U.S. Tax Act was reduced to $94.2 million during the current year as a result of the ATO Settlement discussed in Note 13 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8). Therefore, future repatriation of

cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 13 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).
We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.
Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes
On June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million and 1.00 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”). The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on Jun 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of June 30, 2022, we had $1.4 billion available for draw down under the revolving credit facility.
On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029 (“Senior Notes”).
On June 30, 2022, there was a total of $780.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.
Cash Flow Summary
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $351.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, compared to cash provided of $736.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. The $385.6 million decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the payment of our tax settlement with the ATO of $284.8 million and greater purchases and prepayments of inventory to secure adequate components for the increasing sales demand, partly offset by an increase in operating profit and other net changes in working capital balances compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $229.9 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, compared to cash used of $158.5 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. The $71.5 million increase in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and an increase in payments on maturity of foreign currency contracts compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. We make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as an impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value, and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
We conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps:
Step 0 or Qualitative assessment - Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.
Step 1 - Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.
During the annual reviews for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we completed a Step 0 or Qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
(2)Income Tax. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. These changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on our regular

assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
On September 19, 2021, we concluded the settlement agreement with the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 (“ATO settlement”). The ATO settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years, with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles.
The final net impact of the ATO settlement was $238.7 million, which represents a gross amount of $381.7 million, including interest and penalties of $48.1 million, and adjustments for credits and deductions of $143.0 million. As a result of the ATO settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies, we recorded a benefit of $14.1 million within other comprehensive income, and a $4.1 million reduction of tax credits, which was recorded to income tax expense. As a result of the ATO settlement, we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position.
On September 28, 2021, we remitted final payment to the ATO of $284.8 million, consisting of the agreed settlement amount of $381.7 million less prior remittances made to the ATO of $96.9 million.
Tax years 2018 to 2021 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.
(3)Revenue Recognition. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”). For products in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our SaaS business, revenue associated with professional services are recognized as they are provided. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our SaaS business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some SaaS contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns offered to our customers and their customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, are infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed.
We offer our Sleep and Respiratory Care customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer’s expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods.
We participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Respiratory Care distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors' customers. We reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor, which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method.
We also offer discounts to both our Sleep and Respiratory Care as well as our SaaS customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
When Sleep and Respiratory Care or SaaS contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not required for many of our Sleep and Respiratory Care contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment.
