Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The following information contains certain forward-looking statements of our management. Forward-looking statements are statements that estimate the happening of future events and are not based on historical fact. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “predict,” “probable,” “possible,” “should,” “continue,” or similar terms, variations of those terms or the negative of those terms. The forward-looking statements specified in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements.

General and administrative expenses increased to $179,132 from $91,149 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased primarily in audit and legal expenses, regulatory filing costs, transfer agent fees and general business development costs.
Business development expenses increased to $712,683 from $160,012 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Business development expenses increased primarily in legal costs, travel, engineering studies and consulting fees.
Executive compensation expenses increased to $1,034,450 from $515,579 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Executive compensation expenses increased primarily as a result of stock compensation for executives for services rendered.
Stock compensation-consulting expenses increased to $595,500 from $169,250 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, primarily as a result of the issuance of stock for services rendered by advisors, consultants and other non-related parties.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have an accumulated deficit at August 31, 2022 of $32,523,735. We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate continued operating losses until we generate revenues sufficient to meet our obligations. At August 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $198,899. We will need to rely on private capital investment or loans to fund future operations for the next 12 months.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Statements of Cash Flows:
Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities was $1,073,866 and $461,235 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in cash used for operating activities was primarily for general operating costs, executive compensation, consulting fees and business development costs.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities was $1,178,000 and $556,000 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to an increase in the issuances of common stock for cash.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The prepaid asset of $27,026,000 relates to the potential acquisition of Regreen Technologies, Inc. The valuation of this asset is subject to the completion of milestones in the underlying agreement and all parties meeting requirements. The amount may be impacted by cancellation of the acquisition and/or inability for parties to meet milestones in future periods. There was no impact to the results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2022, as the company has only issued common stock (currently held in escrow) to Regreen for the acquisition. If, upon completion of the acquisition, there has been a material change to the financial condition of Regreen, it may impact the final valuation for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect the liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.
