Overview
In July of 2022 we acquired RAC Real Estate Acquisition Corp, a Wyoming Corporation (RAC). RAC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company, through RAC, plans to focus on real estate transactions, in which we will buy and develop real estate for sale or rent of low-income housing. We plan to invest in three sectors of this market by (i) buying, refurbishing and selling traditional foreclosures, (ii) buying, developing and renting “Land Banks” that have an average pool of homes or lots in excess of 100 in one location and (iii) buying, refurbishing or developing and selling homes made available by the government through HECM pools. We are currently working with a third-party vendor to facilitate this plan.
On July 22, 2022, the Company received a promissory note, in the principal amount of $672,960 from, and entered into a Loan Agreement dated July 18, 2022 with, Fix Pads Holdings, LLC a South Carolina limited liability company. The note has a 12% interest rate per annum payable as follows: (1) a pre-payment on July 22, 2022 of pro-rated interest for the period from July 22, 2022 through July 30, 2022 in the amount of $2,212.47; (2) a pre-payment of interest on August 1, 2022 for the period from August 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022 in the amount of $13,496.07; and then (3) monthly payments of interest only beginning on October 1, 2022 and continuing on the 1st day of each month thereafter until all principal and accrued interest are paid in full by July 1, 2023. The note is secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on 7 properties. Consideration for the note was paid in part by the Company in the amount of $328,625.72 and in part by an investor, Frank Campanaro, in the amount of $328,625.73 (together both amounts equal $657,251.45 which represent the total note amount of $672,960 minus the two prepayments described above). On July 26, 2022, The Company entered into a partial assignment of the promissory note dated July 25, 2022, with Mr. Campanaro whereby the Company assigned to Mr. Campanaro the right to payment of principal in the amount of $336,480 and the right to half of the amount of any interest payments made on the principal amount of the note.

On October 4, 2022, the Company, through RAC, entered into a Limited Liability Agreement with Fixed Pads Holdings. As a result of the agreement, RAC and fix pads formed a limited liability company called RAC FIXPADS II, LLC, incorporated in the state of Delaware. The purpose of which is to purchase, finance, collateralize, improve, rehabilitate, market, sell or lease property, as well as carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity. The LLC has two members RAC and Fix Pads, both providing an initial contribution to the LLC of $1,000 in exchange for a 50% membership interest represented by an issuance of 1,000 Units of the LLC to each party. Each member is entitled to 1 vote per member. The LLC is managed by a manager, Fix Pads.
The Agreement provides that additional capital contributions of the members will be made to the LLC as follows: (i) Fix Pads will transfer and assign all rights to and incidents of ownership for 60 residential properties it has title, or will have title, to the LLC, as set forth in the Agreement; and (ii) RAC will make additional cash contributions to the capital of the LLC, up to a maximum of $5,214,000, on such dates and in such amounts as requested by the LLC, in the manner set forth in the Agreement.
Under the Agreement profits and losses are allocated by the LLC to the members based on initial cash contributions of the members, the value of the properties contributed by Fix Pads and the additional cash contributions by RAC. Distributions to the members under the Agreement will be made as follows: (i) from the sale of each property by the LLC, the LLC shall distribute $13,000 of the net sale proceeds to RAC and distribute and additional amount to RAC equal to the average RAC additional cash capital contribution per property, the balance net proceeds will be distributed to Fix Pads; (ii) for any property that is leased by the LLC, RAC will have the option to buy such property from the LLC and for any such property that is not bought by RAC, any net rental income will be retained by the LLC and distributed to the members based on (a) further written agreement of the members or (b) if the members are unable to agree then on such terms as provided in the Agreement.
Since the acquisition of RAC, the Company, through our third-party vendor, has financed 11 foreclosed homes to be refurbished and sold as a test of the viability of this business model. Our plan over the next 12 months is to finance over 70 foreclosed homes to be refurbished and sold. We plan further to contract with Land Bank lots in excess of 100 lots to be developed into homes for rent. The Land Bank homes are to be constructed with new state of the art panel designed homes that are manufactured in Europe. This will significantly reduce the cost and time of construction for these homes.
Prior to March 16, 2018, we were engaged in the development of mining assets. We never generated any revenue from this business and as of April 30, 2018, all of the assets associated with the mining business were fully reserved against and have no value. On March 16, 2018, we had a change in management and changed our business to developing the business of designing and selling computer equipment which can be used for the mining of cryptocurrency. In April 2019, our sole director and officer resigned and we discontinued the business of designing and selling computer equipment for the cryptocurrency business, from which we did not generate any revenue. On August 14, 2019, the then sole officer and director resigned and Jose Maria Eduardo Gonzalez Romero was elected as our sole officer and director. In 2018 we purchased certain equipment for $500,000 borrowed from Mr. Romero. The equipment was never delivered to us in the United States, and on October 29, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with Gygabyte whereby we paid $10,790 to Gigabyte. Four pallets of equipment have been shipped from Taiwan and are expected to arrive in the U.S. next quarter. The equipment is in component parts and there is no assurance if this can be assembled and mined or sold since this equipment was purchased over three years ago.
On November 1, 2021, we entered into a settlement with Mr. Romero whereby he converted the principal amount of his $500,000 loan along with accrued interest into shares of the company at $.02 per share and we issued additional shares to him for his service as the CEO under his previous employment agreement. The total number of shares issued to Mr. Romero for his note conversion and compensation was 35,189,100.
On June 15, 2022, the Company’s common stock was reverse split at a 1:125 ratio. As a result, our outstanding shares of common stock went from 74,498,250 common stock outstanding to 595,986 common stock outstanding. References in this annual report to shares of common stock outstanding reflect this reverse stock split, unless otherwise stated.
Result of operations
From inception (May 11, 2022) to July 31, 2022
On July 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated June 30, 2022 (the “Agreement”) with RAC Real Estate Acquisition Corp., a Wyoming Corporation (“RAC”) incorporated on May 11, 2022, and the Shareholders of RAC, namely Frank Gillen, Francis Pittilloni, and Yolanda Goodell (“Shareholders”), whereby the Company issued to the Shareholders a combined 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value of $0.001 per share in consideration for a combined 1,000 shares of RAC common stock, par value $0.001, held by Shareholders, which represents 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of RAC. As a result, RAC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Shareholders of RAC paid a combine capital contribution of $500,000 in cash as consideration for their combine 1,000 shares of RAC common stock.
For financial accounting purposes, this transaction was treated as a reverse acquisition by RAC and resulted in a recapitalization with RAC being the accounting acquirer and the Company as the acquired company. The consummation of this reverse acquisition resulted in a change of control. Accordingly, the historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer, RAC, and have been prepared to give retroactive effect to the reverse acquisition completed on June 30, 2022, and represent the operations of RAC. The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date, June 30, 2022, include the balance sheets of both companies at fair value, the historical results of RAC and the results of the Company from the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization.
For the inception (May 11, 2022) to July 31, 2022, we generated revenue from interest income of $1,106.
We incurred operating expenses of $24,344, primarily professional fees, resulting in a loss from operations of $23,238. We did not incur other expenses, resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of $23,238, or ($0.10) per share (basic and diluted).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our working capital at July 31, 2022:
The following tables summarize our cash flows from inception to July 31, 2022.
Operating activities
The cash flow used in operating activities for the inception (May 11, 2022) to July 31, 2022, reflects the net loss of $23,238, adjusted by non-cash interest income of $1,106, increased by accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $8,850 and due to related parties of $5,825.
Investing activities
For the inception (May 11, 2022) to July 31, 2022, the Company received cash from acquisition of subsidiary of $335 and used $328,626 for advance on loan receivable.
Financing activities

Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $23,238. As of July 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $23,238. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to raise necessary funding through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ended July 31, 2023. However, until the Company engages in an active business or makes an acquisition the Company is likely to not be able to raise any significant debt or equity financing.
The ability of the Company to begin operations in its new business model is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining financing to commence operations and develop a business plan or making an acquisition. The Company cannot give any assurance as to its ability to develop or acquire a business or to operate profitably.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates: The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that directly affect the results of reported assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, including the valuation of non-cash transactions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Debt Investments
The Company’s debt securities are primarily invested in a third-party vendor, and asset management company, to purchase, develop and manage real estate properties. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company’s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there generally is no known or accessible market or market indexes for debt instruments for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. The Company may, from time to time, invest in public debt of companies that meet the Company’s investment objectives, and to the extent market quotations or other pricing indicators (i.e. broker quotes) are available, these investments are considered Level 1 or 2 assets in line with ASC Topic 820.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which requires the Company to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue based on the five criteria for revenue recognition established under Topic 606: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify separate performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations, and 5) recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company records interest income on an accrual basis and recognizes it as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement and underlying debt instrument, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Debt investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or fees will not be collected according to contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, the Company ceases to recognize interest and fee income until the portfolio company has paid all principal and interest due or demonstrated the ability to repay its current and future contractual obligations to the Company. The Company may not apply the non-accrual status to a loan where the investment has sufficient collateral value to collect all of the contractual amount due and is in the process of collection. Interest collected on non-accrual investments are generally applied to principal.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have implemented all new pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our consolidated financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
