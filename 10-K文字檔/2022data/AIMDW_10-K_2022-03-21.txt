ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, which involve uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.
Overview
We are engaged in developing medical technologies for point-of-care (“POCT”) testing and safe and novel medical treatment for a broad range of disease indications. Since our inception in 1984, we have concentrated our resources on business planning, raising capital, research and clinical development activities for our programs, securing related intellectual property and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics using low-dose non-injectable interferon (“IFN”). In addition to our core IFN technology, we are committed to developing a diversified healthcare business portfolio to include medical devices and consumer healthcare products.
Although we have historically been involved in extensive pharmaceutical research and development of low-dose oral interferon as a therapeutic, we are prioritizing the commercialization of medical devices as part of our diversification strategy. Since the beginning of 2021, we have acquired significant intellectual property from our majority shareholder, Ainos KY, to expand our potential product portfolio into Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOC”) and COVID-19 POCTs. This includes 51 issued and pending patents related to VOC technologies and 3 issued patents for COVID-19 POCT products. We expect our underlying intellectual property to enable us to expedite the commercialization of our medical device pipeline, beginning with Ainos-branded COVID-19 POCT product candidates.
Medtech Solutions
Our portfolio of medtech solutions is currently comprised of the following:
·
COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kit and Ainos’ Cloud-based Test Management Apps. Our cloud-based test management platform is comprised of an antigen rapid test kit, a personal application, or app, and an enterprise app. We anticipate our management apps will allow individuals and organizations to seamlessly manage tests, trace infections, and share results. As the first commercialized COVID-19 product we sell, we currently market the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit in Taiwan under emergency use authorization (“EUA”) issued by the Taiwan Federal and Drug Administration (“TFDA”) in 2021. We market the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit under our brand name. The kit is manufactured by TCNT, our product co-developer. See “Part I, Item 1 - Strategic Investment and Business Development with Ainos KY”. We expect TCNT to apply for EUA authorization from the U.S. FDA (“FDA”) in mid-2022 and, if a EUA is issued by the FDA, we intend to market this product in the U.S.
·
COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Test. Our solution consists of a color-changing assay that is compatible with standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) machines and delivers test results within 40 minutes, faster than a typical PCR test turnaround time of a few hours to several days. In addition to our assay’s compatibility with existing PCR equipment, we will also offer portable, low-cost test equipment intended to help medical professionals quickly scale testing capacity. We will market the product under the Ainos brand name, and our co-developer TCNT will manufacture the product. See “Part I, Item 1 - Strategic Investment and Business Development with Ainos KY.” The product is currently under EUA review by the TFDA and we expect TCNT to submit for EUA review by the FDA in mid-2022.
·
VOC POCT - Ainos Flora. Our Ainos Flora device will perform a non-invasive test for female vaginal health and certain sexually transmitted diseases (“STDs”) including vaginitis, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis, within a few minutes. We expect Ainos Flora will provide convenient, discreet, rapid testing in a point-of-care setting which will allow women to self-test at home. We are conducting clinical trials in Taiwan and plan to seek TFDA approval for marketing in Taiwan and FDA 510(k) clearance for marketing in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2022.
·
VOC POCT - Ainos Pen. Our Ainos Pen device is a cloud-connected, multi-purpose, portable breath analyzer that is intended to monitor health conditions including oral, gastrointestinal, liver, and renal health within minutes. We expect consumers to be empowered to share their self-test results with their physicians through in-person and telehealth medical consultations. We intend to explore commercialization opportunities with third-party technology and manufacturing collaborators as a non-medical, consumer device in the second quarter of 2022.
·
VOC POCT - CHS430. The CHS430 device is intended to provide non-invasive testing for ventilator-associated pneumonia within 10 minutes, as compared to current standard of care invasive culture tests that typically take more than two days to provide results. We plan to be the exclusive sales agent for CHS430, pursuant to our Product Development Agreement with our co-developer, TCNT, who will manufacture the product. We intend to collaborate with TCNT to conduct clinical trials in Taiwan, after which we expect TCNT to submit applications for TFDA approval for marketing in Taiwan and FDA 510(k) clearance for marketing in the U.S. in 2023.
·
Very Low-Dose Oral Interferon Alpha (“VELDONA”). VELDONA is a low-dose oral interferon alpha (“IFN-α”) formulation based on our nearly four decades of research on IFN-α’s broad treatment applications. We recently initiated a strategic relationship with InnoPharmax, Inc. to jointly develop and market an orally administered cytotoxin-induced complementary combined therapy (“CICCT”) for the treatment of COVID-19 and other potential viral infections. We plan to initiate Phase 2/3 clinical trials for our CICCT treatment in the second quarter of 2022 in Taiwan. We also plan to advance our VELDONA development efforts for disease indications such as thrombocytopenia and Sjögren’s syndrome in 2023.
·
Synthetic RNA (“SRNA”). We are developing a SRNA technology platform in Taiwan. Our initial focus is to develop a potential COVID-19 mRNA vaccine platform using the full-length spike or the RBD gene sequence of the alpha and delta variants as reference sequences. We plan to continue developing these technologies with the goal of initiating clinical trials in Taiwan in 2023.
An integral part of our operating strategy is to create multiple revenue streams through commercializing our product portfolio and leveraging our intellectual property patents, including potentially out-licensing or forming strategic relationships to develop our medical devices, consumer healthcare products and low-dose interferon therapeutics.
In 2022, we are prioritizing the commercialization of our POCT devices, beginning with seeking EUA authorizations for the COVID-19 POCT product candidates and plans to commercialize our other POCT product candidates. As a general strategy, we plan to conduct clinical trials in Taiwan and use the data to apply for TFDA approval and FDA clearance via the 510(k) or comparable pathway. If our products are approved, we plan to work with third-party distributors to market our products in countries where we receive regulatory approval and to seek various business relationships with other medtech companies to market our products. At the same time, we plan to initiate clinical trials for the CICCT and SRNA programs over the course of this year.
Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on further successful development and commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. We anticipate our POCT products candidates to potentially generate organic cash flows to support our business while we invest in our other pipeline projects. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the next few years as we advance our product candidates through preclinical development, clinical trials and regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, and legal and regulatory compliance. We may also incur expenses in connection with strategic relationships for the development of additional product candidates. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses.
Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations with business revenues and proceeds from external sources. We may pursue additional funding that may include our entry into or expansion of borrowing arrangements; research and development incentive payments, government grants, co-financing from pharmaceutical companies and other corporate sources; and potential future collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies or other third parties. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization, potential in-licenses or acquisitions plans for one or more of our product candidates.
We are unable to predict the timing or amount of unexpected expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and related legal regulatory requirements. When we are eventually able to generate additional product sales, those sales may not be sufficient to become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had available cash and cash equivalents of 1,751,499. We anticipate business revenues and further potential financial support from outside sources to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “Part II, Item 7 - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. To finance our continuing operations, we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured.
Strategic Investment and Business Development with Ainos KY
In order to facilitate our diversification strategy through development and commercialization of an expanded base of product offerings we secured a strategic investor, Ainos KY. In December 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, on April 15, 2021, in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, we acquired intellectual property assets from Ainos KY valued at approximately $20,000,000. Through this relationship, we have implemented several strategic initiatives over the past year to augment our product development pipeline and achieve a strengthened financial position.
The following are highlights of recent major corporate milestones that we believe will serve as catalysts for us to develop and commercialize a multi-faceted product portfolio pipeline over the next several years:
·
On June 14, 2021, we became the master sales and marketing agent for the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit and Ainos nucleic acid test kit. We generated $568,164 in revenue from sales of the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit in Taiwan as of the end of 2021.
·
On November 18, 2021, Ainos KY agreed to increase its strategic investment to further bolster our POCT business through an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired additional intellectual property and equipment assets valued at approximately $26,000,000 including technical know-how, medical device manufacturing, testing and office equipment in Taiwan and hired certain of Ainos KY’s R&D personnel. As payment for the assets, in January 2022, we issued to Ainos KY a non-interest bearing Convertible Note in the principal amount of $26,000,000. See “- Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.
·
On December 7, 2021, we entered into a strategic relationship with InnoPharmax, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on new oral drug formulations, to jointly develop and promote an orally administered CICCT for the treatment of COVID-19 and potentially other viral infections. The CICCT initiative leverages our interferon clinical data on influenza and integrates our interferon therapeutic platform, VELDONA, and InnoPharmax’s antiviral drug, GemOral.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic presented us an opportunity to grow our business in 2021. We began selling and recording product revenue for Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in June 2021 after TCNT obtained TFDA EUA in the same month. Between June and December 2021, we generated about $568,164 of revenues from the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit.
In 2021, substantially all of our operating revenue came from the sale of the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in Taiwan. COVID-19 infection rates have been well controlled in Taiwan. According to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (“Taiwan CDC”), total cases in Taiwan were just 17,029 as of December 31, 2021. Over the same period, total cases in the U.S. were around 54,800,000. As a result, the total revenues we generated from our Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits were fewer than we had anticipated. We intend to broaden our market reach if TCNT successfully obtains regulatory clearance in the U.S. or other countries.
We believe affordable, easy-to-use, rapid COVID-19 testing will continue to be in demand at least in the short-term. We anticipate our management apps, when used with the Ainos antigen rapid test kit, will allow individuals and organizations to effectively manage tests, trace infections, and share results. We also anticipate the Ainos COVID-19 nucleic acid test can help medical professionals quickly scale testing capacity if the product receives regulatory clearance.
We are continuing to monitor the potential impact of the pandemic, but we cannot be certain the future impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Depending on developments relating to the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, the pandemic may affect our ability to initiate and complete research studies, delay the initiation of our future research studies, disrupt regulatory activities or have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations for the periods presented.
Comparison of the Year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Revenues, Costs and Gross Margins
Net revenues for 2021 and 2020 were $594,563 and $16,563, respectively. In 2021, we substantially increased revenues by 3,490%, primarily because we began selling the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in June 2021 in Taiwan. Substantially all revenues in 2021 were from the sale of the test kits. All revenues in 2020 were from sales of nutraceutical products.
Cost of revenues for 2021 and 2020 were $184,181 and $11,277, respectively, representing a 1,533% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to increased business activity relating to the test kits. Gross profits rose to $410,382 from $5,286, an improvement of $405,096, or 7,664%. Gross margin for 2021 rose to 69% from 32% for 2020, driven by improved product sales resulting from our Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits.
Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses
Research and development expenses for 2021 and 2020 were $1,920,645 and $389, an increase of 493,639% and $1,920,256, respectively. The increase is associated with higher R&D personnel costs and more expense for technology development and technical license fees. The main components include: costs associated with increased R&D personnel ($214,712), costs associated with technology development (approximately $277,000) and costs associated with intellectual property, including amortization of acquired intellectual properties ($1,264,865). Following the strategic investment by Ainos KY, since August 2021 we have increased research and development staffing to develop our product candidates including POCTs, VELDONA and SRNA research.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administration expense increased to $2,357,163 in 2021 from $1,445,332 in 2020, an increase of 63% and $912,000, respectively. Selling expense increased by approximately $191,000 or 100% due to increased sales and marketing staffing (approximately $76,000) and fees to distributors (approximately $103,000). Administrative expense increased by about 50% amounting to approximately $721,000. Our expenses increased primarily due to increased professional service fees related to the Ainos KY Transaction and corporate governance matters (approximately $298,000) and the increased amortization of acquired intellectual properties (approximately $725,000). The increased administrative expenses were offset by a decrease of personnel expense (approximately $350,000) associated with departure of former directors and officers.
Operating Loss
While our gross profits improved by $405,096 in 2021 compared to $5,286 in 2020, we incurred additional operating expenses as we continue to invest resources to execute our growth strategy and product roadmap. As a result, our operating loss in 2021 increased to $3,867,426 from $1,440,435 in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,751,499, representing an increase from $22,245 as of December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to revenues from sales of our Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit in Taiwan and working capital loans.
Major Transactions in 2021
The following is a summary of our major transactions in 2021.
Securities Purchase Agreement
On April 15, 2021, we closed on a Securities Purchase Agreement with Ainos KY. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we issued 100,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.20 per share to Ainos KY in exchange for certain patent assignments, increased its authorized common stock to 300,000,000 shares, and changed the Company’s name to “Ainos, Inc.” Immediately after the consummation of the transaction, Ainos KY owned approximately 70.30% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Ainos COVID-19 Test Kit Sales and Marketing Agreement with Ainos KY
On June 14, 2021, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Ainos KY to serve as the master sales and marketing agent for the Ainos COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kit and the Ainos COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Test, which were developed by our co-developer TCNT. On June 7, 2021, the TFDA issued an emergency use authorization to TCNT for the Ainos COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kit, which is being marketed and sold under the Ainos brand in Taiwan. As TCNT secures regulatory authorizations from foreign regulatory agencies, we expect to partner with regional distributors to promote sales in other strategic markets. We purchased $183,444 of the Ainos COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kit inventory from TCNT for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0 in 2020.
Ainos - TCNT Product Development Agreement
On August 1, 2021, we entered into a five-year Product Development Agreement with TCNT. Pursuant to the agreement, both parties will endeavor to work together to co-develop pharmaceutical, medical and preventive medicine related products, with the Company being the exclusive sales agent. Under the agreement, we will bear the cost associated with product development and TCNT will make accessible its personnel and facilities. Under the agreement, we incurred product development expenses totaling $205,883 as of December 31, 2021 and accrued payable of $65,156 as of December 31, 2021. We incurred $0 in product development expenses in 2020.
Asset Purchase Agreement
On November 18, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Ainos KY, as amended by an Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 29, 2022. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired intellectual property and manufacturing, testing, and office equipment for a total purchase price of $26,000,000. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we also agreed to hire certain employees of Ainos KY on terms equal to the compensation arrangements undertaken by Ainos KY. From and after the closing, we have no responsibility, duty or liability with respect to any employee benefit plans of Ainos KY.
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we issued to Ainos KY a non-interest bearing convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $26,000,000. The principal sum of the convertible note is payable in cash on January 30, 2027, although we may prepay in whole or in part without penalty. If not earlier repaid, the convertible note will be converted into shares of our common stock or such other securities or property for which the convertible note may become convertible, immediately prior to the closing of any public offering of our common stock as result of which our common stock will be listed on a U.S. stock exchange. The conversion price, subject to certain adjustments, will be 80% of the initial public offering price of such offering. We incurred $26,000,000 as account payable related to the Asset Purchase Agreement as we booked the related assets in 2021.
Other Liquidity and Capital Resource Factors
Our total cash and cash equivalents were $1,751,499 for 2021 and $22,245 for 2020, representing an increase of $1,729,254 mainly attributable to financing activities. Our net cash from financing activities increased to $3,154,373 for 2021 from $120,000 for 2020 due to the issuance of additional convertible notes to certain related parties in 2021. Our total convertible notes payable and other notes payable to related parties increased to $3,589,931 in 2021 from $953,001 in 2020.
We incurred net operating outflow of $1,249,977 for 2021 and $499,551 for 2020. While our revenues grew in 2021, our acquisition of intellectual property, increased staffing, and investment in research and developments increased our expenses and resulted in higher net losses ($3,888,661). These higher net losses were partially offset by increased amortization for acquisition of intellectual property to $2,044,447 for 2021 from $14,698 for 2020.
In 2021, in accordance with the SPA, Ainos KY provided us $3,000,000 in working capital advances. In exchange for the advances, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,000,000 with an interest rate of 1.85% per annum. The notes have maturity dates ranging from October 2021 to June 2022. They are convertible at Ainos KY’s election into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.20 per share.
Between January 2016 and April 2021, we issued multiple convertible promissory notes to Mr. Stephen Chen, our former Chairman, CEO and CFO, for deferred compensation and working capital loans. The total principal of these convertible promissory notes decreased to $376,526 in December 2021 from $670,991 in 2020. In 2021, Mr. Chen assigned certain notes and the assigned notes were subsequently converted into our common shares.
As of December 31, 2021, we had negative working capital, incurred recurring losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities, and an increase in our cumulative liabilities. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements included herein for more information. Our ability to continue operations depends on our success in generating and increasing revenues as well as our ability to secure external financing, when necessary, to fund strategic objectives. We expect to continue to incur losses for the immediate future and will need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities.
We anticipate business revenues and further potential financial support from our majority shareholder, Ainos KY, or others, to fund our operations over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to make us profitable. If these efforts are not successful, we may need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, debt financings or other sources in order to further implement our business plan or we will need to reevaluate our business plan and operating budgets.
In 2022 we intend to focus on commercializing our POCT medical devices and developing our CICCT program. Our near-term liquidity requirements will include expenses for clinical trials, regulatory clearances, and marketing to commercialize our POCT devices, including the Ainos COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Test, the Ainos Flora, the Ainos Pen and our CICCT program. We also intend to increase staffing for general administration, marketing and technology development purposes.
On March 4, 2022, we issued a non-convertible note to Ainos KY in the principal amount of $800,000, at a 1.85% per annum interest rate, with a maturity date of February 28, 2023. We intend to use the proceeds from the note for working capital.
In 2023 and beyond, we intend to invest in research and development and clinical trial spending to advance our VELDONA development efforts for disease indications such as thrombocytopenia and Sjögren’s syndrome. We also plan on investing in clinical trials and regulatory approval for the CHS430 device, in collaboration with TCNT, and clinical trial expenses for our SRNA program.
Critical Accounting Policies
For a discussion of accounting policies considered to be critical given they involve estimates and judgments made by management and are important for our investors’ understanding of our operating results and financial condition, see the Notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021.
