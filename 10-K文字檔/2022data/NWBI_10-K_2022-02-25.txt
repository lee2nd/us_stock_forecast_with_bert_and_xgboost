ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our principal business consists of collecting deposits and making loans primarily secured by various types of collateral, including real estate and other assets in the markets in which we are located. Attracting and maintaining deposits is affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing deposits and other investments offered by other financial and non-financial institutions, account maturities, fee structures, and levels of personal income and savings. Lending activities are affected by the demand for funds and thus are influenced by interest rates, the number and quality of alternative lenders and regional economic conditions. Sources of funds for lending activities include deposits, borrowings, repayments on loans, cash flows from investment and mortgage-backed securities and income provided from operations.
Our earnings depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits, borrowed funds, and trust-preferred securities. Net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, as well as a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets compared to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. Also contributing to our earnings is noninterest income, which consists primarily of service charges and fees on loan and deposit products and services, fees related to investment management and trust services, net gains and losses on the sale of assets and mortgage banking income. Net interest income and noninterest income are offset by provisions for credit losses, general administrative and other expenses, including employee compensation and benefits and occupancy and processing costs, as well as by state and federal income tax expense.
Our net income was $154.3 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $74.9 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $110.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision expense of $84.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a provision expense of $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies are important to the understanding of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances, including, but without limitation, changes in interest rates, performance of the economy, financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations. The following are the accounting estimates we believe are critical.
Allowance for Credit Losses. We recognize that losses will be experienced on assets and that the risk of loss varies with the type of asset, the creditworthiness of a borrower, general economic conditions and the quality of the collateral, if any. We maintain an allowance for expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses based on all available information. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The loan portfolio is reviewed regularly by management in its determination of the allowance for credit losses. The methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes a review of historical losses, peer group comparisons, industry data and economic conditions. As an integral part of their examination process, regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management. In establishing the allowance for credit losses, a combination of statistical models are applied to various pools of outstanding loans. We use a twenty-four month forecasting period and revert to historical average loss rates thereafter. Credit relationships that have been classified as substandard or doubtful and are greater than or equal to $1.0 million are reviewed by the Credit Administration department to determine if they no longer continue to demonstrate similar risk characteristics to their loan pool. If a loan no longer demonstrates similar risk characteristics to their loan pool they are removed from the pool and an individual assessment will be performed. The allowance calculation is also supplemented with qualitative reserves that takes into consideration the current portfolio and specific risk characteristics, such as changes in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or
term, as well as changes in environmental conditions, among other factors, that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the quantitative model component.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic forecast assumptions as well as the reasonable and supportable forecasting periods that are incorporated in our estimate of credit losses. Therefore, as the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change or decisions are made to shorten or lengthen the forecasting period, the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. We utilized a multi-scenario based macroeconomic forecast in determining the December 31, 2021 allowance for credit losses, which included a weighting of three scenarios: an upside scenario, a baseline scenario and a downside scenario. We placed the most weight on the baseline scenario, with the remaining weight split evenly between the upside and downside scenario. If we placed 100% weighting on the baseline scenario, the quantitative allowance for credit losses would have been approximately $11.4 million lower. These forecasts revert to our long-term historical average loss rate after a 24 month forecasting period. If we shortened the forecasting period to twelve months and reverted to our long-term historical loss rate thereafter, the quantitative allowance for credit losses would have been approximately $833,000 higher.
Although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of assets deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed previously. Any material increase in the allowance for credit losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The allowance is based on information known at the time of the review. Changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings. Such changes could impact future results. For further information related to our allowance for credit losses, see Note 1(f) of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The following Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) issued by the FASB have not yet been adopted.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”. This ASU provides temporary optional guidance to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance provides expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments primarily include contract modifications and hedge accounting, as well as providing a one-time election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. This guidance is effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We are currently in the process of evaluating the amendments and determining the impact on our financial statements.
In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform”. This ASU provides amendments, which are elective, and apply to all entities that have derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment of certain derivative instruments that are modified as a result of the reference rate reform. This guidance is effective as of the date of issuance through December 31, 2022. We are currently in the process of evaluating the amendments and determining the impact on our financial statements.
Balance Sheet Analysis
Assets. Total assets at December 31, 2021 were $14.502 billion, an increase of $695.2 million, or 5.0%, from $13.806 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase in assets was due to an increase in both marketable securities and total cash and cash equivalents. A discussion of significant changes follows.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $543.0 million to $1.279 billion at December 31, 2021, from $736.3 million at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the increase in customer deposit balances associated with consumer stimulus checks and loan funds from the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).
Marketable securities. Marketable securities increased by $738.9 million, or 46.8%, to $2.317 billion at December 31, 2021, from $1.578 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily a result of investing excess cash generated by deposits within our held-to-maturity portfolio.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and fair value of our available-for-sale marketable securities portfolio and mortgage-backed securities portfolio at the dates indicated.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and fair value of our held-to-maturity marketable securities portfolio and mortgage-backed securities portfolio at the dates indicated.

Marketable Securities Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities, carrying values, amortized cost, market values and weighted average yields for our marketable securities and mortgage-backed securities portfolios at December 31, 2021. The annualized weighted average yields are calculated by taking the interest of the marketable securities divided by the amortized cost. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.
Further information and analysis of our investment portfolio, including tables with information related to gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for sale and held-to-maturity marketable securities and tables showing the fair value and gross unrealized losses on marketable securities aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position are located in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loans Receivable. Net loans receivable decreased by $532.3 million, or 5.1%, to $9.914 billion at December 31, 2021, from $10.446 billion at December 31, 2020. This decrease was due primarily to loan paydowns and payoffs outpacing new originations across all of our loan portfolios with the exception of our consumer loan portfolio which increased $330.8 million, or 21.9%, to $1.839 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.508 billion at December 31, 2020.
Set forth below are selected data related to the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated.
(1) Consists primarily of secured and unsecured personal loans.
The following table sets forth the maturity of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. Demand loans and loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. Adjustable and floating-rate loans are included in the period in which they contractually mature, and fixed-rate loans are included in the period in which the contractual repayment is due.
The following table sets forth at December 31, 2021, the dollar amount of all fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans due one year or more after December 31, 2021. Adjustable and floating-rate loans are included in the table based on the contractual due date of the loan.
Deposits. Total deposits increased by $701.9 million, or 6.1%, to $12.301 billion at December 31, 2021 from $11.599 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $383.3 million, or 14.1%, to $3.100 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.716 billion at December 31, 2020 and an increase in savings deposits of $256.3 million, or 12.5%, to $2.304 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.047 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, money market deposit accounts increased by $192.3 million, or 7.9%, to $2.630 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.438 billion at December 31, 2020 and interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $184.5 million, or 6.7%, to $2.940 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.756 billion at December 31, 2020. These deposit account increases were the result of both consumer stimulus checks and PPP loan funds as well as consumer saving trends. Partially offsetting these increases, time deposits decreased by $314.5 million, or 19.2%, as customer trends have moved funds from term products to checking and savings accounts.
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of deposits in the various types of accounts we offered at the dates indicated.
(1) Represents percentage of total deposits.
(2) Represents weighted average nominal rate at year end.
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of deposits in each state by branch location as of December 31, 2021.
The following table indicates the amount of our certificates of deposits of $250,000 or more by time remaining until maturity at December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had deposits in excess of $250,000 (the limit for FDIC insurance) of $123.7 million and $181.7 million, respectively. At those dates, we had no deposits that were uninsured for any other reason.
Borrowings. Borrowings decreased by $20.4 million, or 7.2%, to $262.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $283.0 million at December 31, 2020. This decrease was a result of $22.0 million of term notes payable to the FHLB maturing during the current year.
The following table sets forth information concerning our borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated.
Shareholders’ equity. Total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $1.584 billion, an increase of $44.9 million, or 2.9%, from $1.539 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase in equity was primarily the result of net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $154.3 million. This increase was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends of $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $154.3 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, an increase of $79.5 million, or 106.2%, from $74.9 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income resulted from a decrease in provision for credit losses of $95.9 million, or 114.2%, an increase in noninterest income of $10.6 million, or 8.0%, and a decrease in noninterest expense of $2.6 million, or 0.7%. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in income tax expense of $29.1 million, or 164.8%, and a decrease in net interest income of $466,000, or 0.1%.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents returns on average equity and average assets of 9.91% and 1.08%, respectively, compared to 4.72% and 0.58% for the year ended December 31, 2020. A discussion of significant changes follows.
Interest Income. Total interest income decreased by $15.6 million, or 3.6%, to $418.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $434.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is the result of decreases in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in average yield is attributed to a decline in overall market interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease in rates was an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $1.503 billion, or 12.8%, to $13.236 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $11.733 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest income on loans receivable decreased by $20.6 million, or 5.0%, to $390.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $410.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in interest income on loans receivable is primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on loans receivable to 3.81% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.07% for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the decrease in market interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average balance of loans receivable which increased $135.2 million, or 1.3%, to $10.240 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $10.104 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in our consumer portfolio. At December 31, 2021, there was $69.4 million in PPP loans outstanding, and included in loan interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14.6 million of accretion related to PPP fees, net of origination costs, compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest income on mortgage-backed securities increased by $4.0 million, or 23.2%, to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is the result of an increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities by $814.3 million, or 91.5%, to $1.704 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $889.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily a result of additional purchases utilizing excess cash from deposit growth during the current year. Partially offsetting this increase in average balance was a decrease in the average yield on mortgage-backed securities to 1.26% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 1.96% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in yield was the result of the new security purchases made at lower yields due to decreases in market interest rates.
Interest income on investment securities increased by $1.1 million, or 26.1%, to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $154.7 million, or 78.9%, to $350.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $196.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the utilization of excess funds from deposit growth. Partially offsetting this increase in average balances was a decrease in the average yield on investment securities to 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.06% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as new investment purchases were at lower yields than the existing portfolio due to lower market interest rates.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased by $574,000, or 58.5%, to $407,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $981,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is the result of decreases in the average yield on FHLB stock which decreased to 2.01% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.50% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The FHLB of Pittsburgh decreased yields on required stock holdings due to lower market interest rates. In addition, the average balance of FHLB stock decreased by $1.6 million, or 7.1%, to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Required FHLB stock holdings fluctuate with, among other things, the utilization of our borrowing capacity as well as capital requirements established by the FHLB.
Interest income on interest-earning deposits increased by $475,000, or 66.1%, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $719,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits. The average balance increased by $400.7 million, or 77.0%, to $921.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $520.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to excess liquidity from steady deposit inflows. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average yield on interesting-earning deposits to 0.13% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.14% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $15.1 million, or 35.6%, to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities which decreased to 0.29% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease resulted from decreases in the interest rates paid on deposits and junior subordinated debentures in response to decreases in market interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities by $797.9 million, or 9.2%, to $9.501 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $8.703 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in average balance resulted from internal growth in deposits and the issuance of $125.0 million of fixed-to-floating subordinated debt in September of 2020.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income remained relatively flat, decreasing by $466,000, or 0.1%, to $391.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decline was attributable to the overall decrease in interest income and interest expense that largely offset each other. Our interest rate spread decreased to 2.88% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.21% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our net interest margin also decreased to 2.96% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the change in interest-earning asset mix. Contributing to the decline was an increase in average cash balances of $400.7 million, earning 0.13%, due to deposit growth associated with PPP loan funds and consumer stimulus checks.
Provision for Credit Losses. We analyze the allowance for credit losses as described in Note 1(f) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for credit losses decreased by $95.9 million, or 114.2%, to a net credit of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision expense of $84.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The prior year provision was elevated due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 and the negative effects to the economic forecasts. Throughout 2021, we were able to release those credit loss reserves that were previously built up as the economic forecasts and our overall credit quality improved. Total classified loans decreased by $126.1 million, or 25.8%, to $363.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $489.3 million at December 31, 2020. In addition, net charge-offs to average loans decreased to 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In determining the amount of the current period provision, we considered current economic conditions, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy filings, and changes in real estate values, and assessed the impact of these factors on the quality of our loan portfolio and historical loss experience. We analyze the allowance for credit losses as described in the section entitled “Allowance for Credit Losses”. The provision that is recorded is sufficient, in our judgment, to bring this reserve to a level that reflects the current expected lifetime losses in our loan portfolio relative to loan mix, a reasonable and supportable economic forecast period and historical loss experience at December 31, 2021.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased by $10.6 million, or 8.0%, to $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $132.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is largely due to the $25.3 million gain recognized on the sale of the insurance business in the second quarter of 2021. Also contributing to this increase was a $7.0 million, or 33.5%, increase in trust and other financial services income to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of growth in both customer accounts and market gains. Partially offsetting these increases, was a decrease in mortgage banking income of $15.5 million, or 49.4%, to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to the impact of less favorable pricing in the secondary market. Additionally, service charges and fees decreased $3.8 million, or 6.8%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the impact of the Durbin amendment on our interchange fees which came into effect in the second half of 2020.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased by $2.6 million, or 0.7%, to $344.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $347.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $17.3 million, or 83.4%, in merger, asset disposition and restructuring expense to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to expenses incurred in the prior year for the MutualBank acquisition and the 2020 branch optimization initiative. Also, other expenses decreased $8.1 million, or 49.4%, to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments. The prior year was significantly impacted by the onset of COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding the possible negative effect on loan commitments and undrawn lines of credit. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in compensation and employee benefits of $15.5 million, or 8.7%, to $193.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $178.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in health insurance and other benefits costs, regular merit expense and the addition of MutualBank and other strategic personnel. Additionally, processing expenses increased $5.7 million, or 11.4%, to $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure as well as increases in activity-driven utilization fees for ATM, check card and online and mobile banking. Lastly, professional service expense increased $5.1 million, or 41.2%, to $17.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the utilization of third-party experts to assist with our digital strategy rollout.
Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $29.1 million, or 164.8%, to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in income tax expense is primarily due to the $108.6 million, or 117.4%, increase in pretax income to $201.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 23.3% compared to 19.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
General. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $74.9 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, a decrease of $35.6 million, or 32.2%, from $110.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income resulted from an increase in provision for credit losses of $61.3 million, or 270.6%, and an increase in noninterest expense of $51.4 million, or 17.4%. Partially offsetting these increases were an increase in noninterest income of $32.9 million, or 33.1%, an increase in net interest income of $31.3 million, or 8.7%, and a decrease in income tax expense of $13.0 million, or 42.4%.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents returns on average equity and average assets of 4.72% and 0.58%, respectively, compared to 8.36% and 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2019. A discussion of significant changes follows.
Interest Income. Total interest income increased by $16.7 million, or 4.0%, to $434.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $417.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is the result of an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $2.294 billion, or 24.3%, to $11.733 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $9.438 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Partially offsetting this increase in average balances was a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.42% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in average yield is attributed to a decline in overall market interest rates.
Interest income on loans receivable increased by $16.1 million, or 4.1%, to $410.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in interest income on loans receivable is attributed to the increase in the average balance on loans receivable. The average balance increased by $1.549 billion, or 18.1%, to $10.104 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.555 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is due primarily to the addition of $1.517 billion, at fair value, of loans related to the MutualBank acquisition and organic loan growth of $255.2 million. Contributing to this organic loan growth was the origination of approximately $500.0 million of PPP loans. Included in loan interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $3.1 million of accretion related to MutualBank loan purchase accounting and $5.7 million of accretion related to PPP fees, net of origination costs. Partially offsetting this increase in average balances was a decrease in the average yield on loans receivable to 4.07% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.61% for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in market interest rates.
Interest income on mortgage-backed securities increased by $746,000, or 4.5%, to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is the result of an increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities by $250.0 million, or 39.1%, to $889.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $639.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily a result of investment securities received as part of the MutualBank acquisition as well as additional purchases utilizing excess cash from deposit growth during the current year. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average yield on mortgage-backed securities to 1.96% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.61% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in yield was partially due to the assumption of mortgage-backed securities from MutualBank with market yields lower than the existing Northwest portfolio due to mark-to-market purchase accounting adjustments. In addition, new security purchases were made at lower yields due to decreases in market interest rates.
Interest income on investment securities remained relatively flat, decreasing by $200,000, or 4.7%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is the result of a decrease in the average balance of investment securities of $9.7 million, or 4.7%, to $196.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $205.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily due to the maturity or call of government agency securities. The average yield on investment securities remained flat at 2.06% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased by $75,000, or 7.1%, to $981,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is the result of decreases in the average yield on FHLB stock which decreased to 4.50% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 7.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The FHLB of Pittsburgh recently decreased yields on required stock holdings in reaction to lower market interest rates. Slightly offsetting this
decrease was an increase in the average balance on FHLB stock by $7.3 million, or 50.5%, to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to FHLB stock acquired and retained from MutualBank. Required FHLB stock holdings fluctuate with, among other things, the utilization of our borrowing capacity as well as capital requirements established by the FHLB.
Interest income on interest-earning deposits increased by $119,000, or 19.8%, to $719,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $600,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits. The average balance increased by $497.4 million to $520.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to excess liquidity from recent deposit inflows. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average yield on interesting-earning deposits to 0.14% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.54% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the Federal Reserve decreasing their targeted federal funds rate.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $14.6 million, or 25.6%, to $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities which decreased to 0.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 0.82% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted from decreases in the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds in response to decreases in market interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities by $1.736 billion, or 24.9%, to $8.703 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6.968 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in average balance resulted from both internal growth in deposits and borrowings as well as the addition of $1.617 billion of deposits and $232.2 million of borrowed funds from the acquisition of MutualBank.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased by $31.3 million, or 8.7%, to $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $360.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to the factors discussed above. Despite the overall increase in net interest income due primarily to balance sheet growth, our interest rate spread decreased to 3.21% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 3.61% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our net interest margin also decreased to 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 3.82% for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to declining interest-earning asset yields. Contributing to the decline in asset yields was an increase in average cash balances of $497.4 million, earning just 0.14%, due to deposit growth associated with PPP loan funds and consumer stimulus checks.
Provision for Credit Losses. We analyze the allowance for credit losses as described in Note 1(f) of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for credit losses increased by $61.3 million to $84.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the current year, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, (“CECL”), which requires that all financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected inclusive of the Company’s current estimate of all lifetime expected credit losses. The economic impact of COVID-19, in combination with CECL, including the purchase accounting impact from MutualBank, caused the increase in the provision for the year.
In determining the amount of the current period provision, we considered current economic conditions, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy filings, and changes in real estate values, and assessed the impact of these factors on the quality of our loan portfolio and historical loss experience. We analyze the allowance for credit losses as described in the section entitled “Allowance for Credit Losses”. The provision that was recorded is sufficient, in our judgment, to bring this reserve to a level that reflects the current expected lifetime losses in our loan portfolio relative to loan mix, a reasonable and supportable economic forecast period and historical loss experience at December 31, 2020.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased by $32.9 million, or 33.1%, to $132.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily attributable to a $27.6 million increase in mortgage banking income to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to continued efforts to expand our secondary market sales capabilities over the last year, as well as an interest rate environment conducive to refinance activity and attractive secondary market pricing. In addition, trust and other financial services income increased by $3.2 million, or 17.8%, to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as an increase of $2.5 million, or 4.8%, in service charges and fees to $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, both due primarily to additional fee income as a result of the MutualBank acquisition.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased by $51.4 million, or 17.4%, to $347.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $296.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. All noninterest expense categories, with the exception of real estate owned expense, increased compared to last year. The largest drivers of the overall increase were an increase of $16.6 million in acquisition and branch optimization expenses to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to expenses incurred as part of the MutualBank acquisition as well as expenses incurred as part of the branch optimization initiative that occurred during December. In addition, compensation and employee benefits expense
increased by $15.3 million, or 9.4%, to $178.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to internal growth in compensation and staff as well as the addition of MutualBank employees. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in processing expenses of $7.6 million, or 17.9%, to $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to our continued efforts to invest in technology and infrastructure as well as improvements to our mortgage and commercial loan origination platforms. Additionally, FDIC premiums increased by $4.1 million to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $685,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to assessment credits received in the prior year.
Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by $13.0 million, or 42.4%, to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to the $48.6 million, or 34.4%, decrease in pretax income to $92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $141.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 19.1% compared to 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Asset Quality
We actively manage asset quality through our underwriting practices and collection procedures. Our underwriting practices are focused on balancing risk and return while our collection operations focus on diligently working with delinquent borrowers in an effort to minimize losses.
Collection procedures. Our collection procedures for personal loans generally provide that at 15 days delinquent, a notice of late charges is sent and personal contact efforts are attempted by telephone to strengthen the collection process and obtain reasons for the delinquency. Also, plans to establish a payment program are developed. Personal contact efforts are continued throughout the collection process, as necessary. Generally, if a loan becomes 30 days past due, a collection letter is sent and the loan becomes subject to possible legal action if suitable arrangements for payment have not been made. In addition, the borrower is given information which provides access to consumer counseling services to the extent required by the regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other applicable authorities. When a loan continues in a delinquent status for 60 days or more, and a payment schedule has not been developed or kept by the borrower, we may send the borrower a notice of intent to foreclose, providing for cure periods of at least 30 days. If not cured, foreclosure proceedings are initiated.
Nonperforming assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of all contractual principal and/or interest is doubtful. Loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income.
Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time that it is sold. When real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, it is recorded at the lower of the related loan balance or its fair value as determined by an appraisal, less estimated costs of disposal. If the value of the property is less than the principal balance, less any related specific credit loss reserve allocations, the difference is charged against the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent write-down of real estate owned or loss at the time of disposition is charged against earnings.
Nonaccrual, Past Due, Restructured Loans and Nonperforming Assets. The following table sets forth information with respect to nonperforming assets. Nonaccrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Generally, when a loan becomes 90 days past due, we fully reverse all accrued interest thereon and cease to accrue interest thereafter. Exceptions are made for loans that have contractually matured, are in the process of being modified to extend the maturity date and are otherwise current as to principal and interest, and well secured loans that are in process of collection. Loans may also be placed on nonaccrual before they reach 90 days past due if conditions exist that call into question our ability to collect all contractual principal and/or interest. Other nonperforming assets represent property acquired through foreclosure or repossession. Foreclosed property is carried at the lower of its fair value less estimated costs to sell or the principal balance of the related loan.
(1)Also included in nonaccrual loans above.
Classification of Assets. Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans, or other assets including other real estate owned, considered to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful,” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the financial institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable”. Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” so that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess some weaknesses, are required to be designated as “special mention”. At December 31, 2021, we had 109 loans, with an aggregate principal balance of $79.9 million, designated as “special mention”.
We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Our largest classified assets generally are also our largest nonperforming assets.
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of our classified assets at the dates indicated.
Allowance for Credit Losses. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1. Our Board of Directors has adopted an “Allowance for Credit Losses” (“ACL”) policy designed to provide management with a systematic methodology for determining and documenting the allowance for credit losses each reporting period. This methodology was developed to provide a consistent process and review procedure to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is in conformity with GAAP, our policies and procedures and other supervisory and regulatory guidelines.
On an ongoing basis, the Credit Administration department, as well as loan officers, branch managers and department heads, review and monitor the loan portfolio for problem loans. This portfolio monitoring includes a review of the monthly delinquency reports as well as historical comparisons and trend analysis. Personal and small business commercial loans are classified primarily by delinquency status. In addition, a meeting is held every quarter with each region to monitor the performance and status of commercial loans on an internal watch list. On an on-going basis, the loan officer, in conjunction with a portfolio manager, grades or classifies problem commercial loans or potential problem commercial loans based upon their knowledge of the lending relationship and other information previously accumulated. This rating is also reviewed independently by our Loan Review department on a periodic basis. Our loan grading system for problem commercial loans is consistent with industry regulatory guidelines which classifies loans as “substandard”, “doubtful” or “loss”. Loans that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the previous categories, but which possess some weaknesses, are designated as “special mention”. A “substandard” loan is any loan that is 90 days or more contractually delinquent or is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as “doubtful” have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions or values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as “loss” have all the weakness inherent in those classified as “doubtful” and are considered uncollectible.
Credit relationships that have been classified as substandard or doubtful and are greater than or equal to $1.0 million are reviewed by the Credit Administration department to determine if they no longer continue to demonstrate similar risk characteristics to their loan pool. If a loan no longer demonstrates similar risk characteristics to their loan pool they are removed from the pool and an individual assessment will be performed.
If it is determined that a loan needs to be individually assessed, the Credit Administration department determines the proper measure of fair value for each loan based on one of three methods: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; (2) the loan’s observable market price; or (3) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less costs of sale or disposal. If the measurement of the fair value of the loan is more or less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Credit Administration department adjusts the specific allowance associated with that individual loan accordingly.
If a substandard or doubtful loan is not grouped with other loans that possess common characteristics for evaluation and analysis, it is considered individually for impairment. For the purpose of calculating reserves, we have grouped our loans into seven segments: residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, vehicle loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial real estate loans - owner occupied and commercial loans. The allowance for credit losses is measured using a combination of statistical models. We use a twenty-four month forecasting period and revert to historical average loss rates thereafter. Reversion to average loss rates takes place over twelve months. Historical average loss rates are calculated using historical data beginning in October 2009 through the current period.
The credit losses for individually assessed loans along with the estimated loss for each homogeneous pool are consolidated into one summary document. This summary schedule along with the support documentation used to establish this schedule is presented to management’s Allowance for Credit Losses Committee (“ACL Committee”) monthly. The ACL Committee reviews and approves the processes and ACL documentation presented. Based on this review and discussion, the appropriate amount of ACL is estimated and any adjustments to reconcile the actual ACL with this estimate are determined. The ACL Committee also considers if any changes to the methodology are needed. In addition to the ACL Committee’s review and approval, a review is performed by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and annually by internal audit.
In addition to the reviews by management’s ACL Committee and the Board of Directors’ Risk Management Committee, regulators from the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking perform an extensive review on at least an annual basis for the adequacy of the ACL and its conformity with regulatory guidelines and pronouncements. Any recommendations or enhancements from these independent parties are considered by management and the ACL Committee and implemented accordingly.
We acknowledge that this is a dynamic process and consists of factors, many of which are external and out of our control that can change frequently, rapidly and substantially. The adequacy of the ACL is based upon estimates using all the information previously discussed as well as current and known circumstances and events. There is no assurance that actual portfolio losses will not be substantially different than those that were estimated.
We utilize a structured methodology each period when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses, which the ACL Committee assesses regularly for appropriateness. As part of the analysis as of December 31, 2021, we considered the most recent economic conditions and forecasts available which incorporated the impact of COVID-19. In addition, we considered the overall trends in asset quality, reserves on individually assessed loans, historical loss rates and collateral valuations. The ACL decreased by $32.2 million, or 23.9%, to $102.2 million, or 1.02% of gross loans at December 31, 2021 from $134.4 million, or 1.27% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. During 2020 our allowance increased $8.8 million as a result of recording the initial allowance on the purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired from MutualBank. The non-purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired from MutualBank resulted in a credit mark of $28.1 million and an additional allowance of $18.2 million, as required by CECL. The estimated economic impact of COVID-19 caused us to increase our provision for credit loss expense by approximately $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Throughout 2021, we were able to release those credit loss reserves that were previously built up as the economic forecasts improved as well as our overall credit quality.
Quarterly, management’s Credit Committee reviews the concentration of credit by industry and customer, lending products and activity, competition and collateral values, as well as economic conditions in general and in each of our market areas. The Credit Committee also reviews and discusses delinquency trends, nonperforming asset amounts and ACL levels and ratios compared to our peer group as well as state and national statistics.
We also consider how the levels of non-accrual loans and historical charge-offs have influenced the required amount of ACL. Nonaccrual loans of $158.5 million, or 1.59% of total gross loans receivable at December 31, 2021, increased by $55.6 million, or 54.1%, from $102.8 million, or 0.98% of total gross loans receivable, at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to loans within the hospitality industry that were placed on nonaccrual after the end of their deferral periods. As a percentage of average loans, net charge-offs decreased to 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net charge-offs was largely due to a $9.1 million charge-off on one commercial loan which was previously downgraded and reserved for in 2020 prior to the onset of COVID-19.
Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses. The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated.
Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses. The following tables set forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The allowance for credit losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category.

GAAP basis net interest rate spreads were 2.88%, 3.21% and 3.61%, respectively, and GAAP basis net interest margins were 2.96%, 3.34% and 3.82%, respectively.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents, on a FTE basis, the changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume multiplied by the prior year rate; (2) changes in rate multiplied by the prior year volume; and (3) the total increase or decrease. Changes not solely attributable to rate or volume have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. There were no out-of-period adjustments or other exclusions from the amounts presented in the table.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Northwest Bank is required to maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets, as determined by management and defined and reviewed for adequacy by the FDIC during their regular examinations. The FDIC, however, does not prescribe by regulation a minimum amount or percentage of liquid assets. The FDIC allows us to consider any unencumbered, available-for-sale marketable security, whose sale would not impair our capital adequacy, to be eligible for liquidity. Liquidity is monitored through the use of a standard liquidity ratio of liquid assets to borrowings plus deposits. Using this formula, Northwest Bank’s liquidity ratio was 21.24% as of December 31, 2021. We adjust our liquidity level in order to meet funding needs of deposit outflows, repayment of borrowings and loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet our asset and liability management objectives. Liquidity needs can also be met by temporarily drawing upon lines-of-credit established for such reasons. At December 31, 2021, Northwest Bank had $3.613 billion of additional borrowing capacity available with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, including a $250.0 million overnight line of credit, which had no balance at December 31, 2021, as well as $101.0 million of borrowing capacity available with the Federal Reserve Bank and $110.0 million with three correspondent banks.
In addition to deposits, our primary sources of funds are the amortization and repayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rate levels, economic conditions, and competition. We manage the pricing of our deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest earning and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Short-term interest-earning deposits amounted to $1.211 billion at December 31, 2021. For additional information about our cash flows from operating, financing, and investing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
A portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing, and financing activities. The primary sources of cash during the current year were net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities and net increase in deposits.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, which provide an additional source of funds. At December 31, 2021, Northwest Bank had no outstanding advances with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. We borrow from these sources to reduce interest rate risk and to provide liquidity when necessary.
At December 31, 2021, our customers had $1.054 billion of unused lines of credit available and $355.7 million in loan commitments. This amount does not include the unfunded portion of loans in process. Time deposits scheduled to mature in less than one year at December 31, 2021, totaled $890.1 million. We believe that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us.
Deposits are our primary source of externally generated funds. The level of deposit inflows during any given period is heavily influenced by factors outside of our control, such as consumer savings tendencies, the general level of short-term and long-term market interest rates, as well as higher alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing investments such as money market mutual funds. Financial institutions, such as Northwest Bank, are also subject to deposit outflows. Our net deposits increased by $701.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by $3.007 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and increased by $697.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Similarly, the amount of principal repayments on loans and the amount of new loan originations is heavily influenced by the general level of market interest rates, consumer confidence and consumer spending. Funds received from loan maturities and principal payments on loans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $4.490 billion, $4.384 billion and $3.275 billion, respectively. Loan originations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $4.715 billion, $5.386 billion and $3.789 billion, respectively. We also sell a portion of the loans we originate as part of our mortgage banking operations, and the cash flows from such sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $804.7 million, $704.7 million and $62.4 million, respectively.
We experience significant cash flows from our portfolio of marketable securities as principal payments are received on mortgage-backed securities and as investment securities mature or are called. Cash flow from the repayment of principal and the maturity or call of marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $517.9 million, $396.3 million and $245.8 million, respectively.
When necessary, we utilize borrowings as a source of liquidity and as a source of funds for long-term investment when market conditions permit. The net cash flow from the receipt and repayment of borrowings was a net decrease of $20.7 million, a net decrease of $192.4 million and a net increase of $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We monitor the capital levels of Northwest Bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for “well capitalized” institutions. Northwest Bank is required by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC to meet minimum capital adequacy requirements. At December 31, 2021, Northwest Bank exceeded all regulatory minimum capital requirements and is considered to be “well capitalized”. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we were not aware of any recommendation by a regulatory authority that, if it were implemented, would have a material effect on liquidity, capital resources or operations.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. Northwest Bank is subject to minimum capital requirements established by the FDIC. See “Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action”. The following table summarizes Northwest Bank’s total shareholders’ equity, regulatory capital, total risk-based assets, and leverage and risk-based capital ratios at the dates indicated.
(1)Tier 2 capital consists of the allowance for credit losses, which is limited to 1.25% of total risk-weighted assets as detailed under the regulations of the FDIC, and 45% of pre-tax net unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale.
Northwest Bank is also subject to capital guidelines of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Department of Banking requires 6% leverage capital and 10% total risk-based capital. See “Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action”.
Contractual Obligations. We are obligated to make future payments according to various contracts. The following table presents the expected future payments of the contractual obligations aggregated by obligation type at December 31, 2021.
(1)See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information.
(2)See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Borrowed Funds, for additional information.
(3)See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Leases, for additional information.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices. The Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, presented elsewhere herein, have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. As a financial services provider, we are routinely a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. In addition, we routinely enter into commitments to purchase and sell residential mortgage loans.
