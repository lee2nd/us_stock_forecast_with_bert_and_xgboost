Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand Canterbury Park Holding Corporation, our operations, our financial results and financial condition, and our present business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (the “Notes”). Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
STRATEGIC OVERVIEW
Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) hosts pari-mutuel wagering on thoroughbred and quarter horse races and “unbanked” card games at its Canterbury Park Racetrack and Card Casino facility (the “Racetrack”) in Shakopee, Minnesota, which is approximately 25 miles southwest of downtown Minneapolis. The Racetrack is the only facility in the State of Minnesota that offers live pari-mutuel thoroughbred and quarter horse racing.
The Company’s pari-mutuel wagering operations include both wagering on thoroughbred and quarter horse races during live meets at the Racetrack each year from May through September, and year-round wagering on races primarily held at out-of-state racetracks that are televised simultaneously at the Racetrack (“simulcasting”). Unbanked card games, in which patrons compete against each other, are hosted in the Card Casino at the Racetrack. The Card Casino operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Card Casino offers both poker and table games at up to 80 tables. The Company also derives revenues from related services and activities, such as food and beverage, parking, advertising signage, publication sales, and from other entertainment events and activities held at the Racetrack.
In 2021, Canterbury Development continued to pursue various development opportunities begun in 2015 for its underutilized land in a project known as Canterbury Commons. These development opportunities have included contributions of land to joint ventures, three as of the end of December 2021, and sales of parcels of land to third parties that will then develop the property. Our long-term strategic direction is to continue to enhance our Racetrack as a unique gaming and entertainment destination and develop the approximately 80 acres of underutilized land not needed for our Racetrack Operations.
The following summarizes our financial performance for the last five years (in 000’s):
During fiscal year 2021, the Company reduced operating expenses $6,314,000 by recording an employee retention credit, a refundable tax credit.
During fiscal year 2019, the Company reduced operating expenses $21,000 by recording a gain on insurance recoveries.
During fiscal year 2018, the Company reduced operating expenses $141,000 by recording a gain on insurance recoveries.
During fiscal year 2017, the Company reduced operating expenses by $1,465,000 by recording a gain on insurance recoveries.
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
In January 2020, an outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a new strain of coronavirus was identified. The disease has since spread rapidly across the world, causing the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a pandemic (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”) on March 12, 2020. Since that time, governments and businesses have taken measures to limit the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, including the issuance of shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures, travel bans and restrictions, and business shutdowns.
On March 16, 2020, the Company announced that, based on the advice of Minnesota state and regulatory bodies, it was temporarily suspending all Card Casino, simulcast, and special events operations at Canterbury Park in response to concerns about the COVID-19 Pandemic. Canterbury Park determined this voluntary suspension of activities was in the best interest of the health and safety of its guests and team members and would provide the Company an opportunity to review and update operational best practices and strategies based on what was currently known about this public health situation and future developments. On June 10, 2020, the Company reopened and resumed simulcast, live racing, and food and beverage operations. The Company also resumed table games and poker operations in the Company’s Card Casino on June 15, 2020 and July 9, 2020, respectively. These reopenings were done in compliance with Minnesota state guidelines on capacity limitations.
On November 18, 2020, Minnesota state and regulatory bodies issued an executive order requiring closure of places of public accommodation as a measure to slow the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the Company temporarily suspended all Card Casino, simulcast, and food and beverage operations from November 21, 2020 through January 10, 2021.
In connection with reopening our pari-mutuel, food and beverage, and Card Casino operations, we adhered to social distancing requirements, which included reduced seating at table games and poker and capacity limitations to follow Minnesota state guidelines. Effective May 28, 2021, all capacity limits, restrictions on large gatherings, and other restrictions, which had been implemented in response to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, were lifted and our Racetrack began operating operated under pre-pandemic guidelines. Our Card Casino also began operating without capacity restrictions effective May 28, 2021, but we maintained and intend to maintain certain operational changes and improvements initiated in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The disruptions arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic had a significant impact on the Company's financial condition and operations during 2020. The COVID-19 Pandemic also had a negative impact on the Company's financial condition and operations for the first half of 2021, although to a much lesser extent than 2020. However, the Company's revenues began to recover starting in the 2021 second quarter. The strong recovery we have experienced in 2021 have been a result of increased consumer confidence, reduction in capacity restrictions, and faster than anticipated vaccine roll-outs, as well as the success of initiatives begun during the COVID-19 Pandemic to increase attendance at live racing and other events, enhance the player experience, and recruit higher value players. Although the Company has currently appeared to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the pandemic has caused other global issues that could have a future adverse effect on the Company. Specifically, these issues relate to supply chain issues and labor shortages, which have had some negative impact on our business and may continue to have an impact in the near future. Additionally, the spread of any new COVID-19 variants could also have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results. As the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess the impact on the Company and respond accordingly.
EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT
The employee retention credit (“ERC”), as originally enacted on March 27, 2020 by the CARES Act, is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes equal to 50% of the qualified wages an eligible employer pays to employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act (the “Relief Act”), enacted on December 27, 2020, amended, and extended the ERC. The Relief Act extended and enhanced the ERC for qualified wages paid after December 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021. Under the Relief Act, eligible employers may claim a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes equal to 70% of the qualified wages an eligible employer pays to employees after December 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021. The purpose of the ERC is to encourage employers to keep employees on the payroll, even if they are not working during the covered period because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Company qualified for federal government assistance through the ERC provisions for the 2020 second, third, and fourth quarters, as well as the 2021 first and second quarters. We recognize government grants for which there is a reasonable assurance of compliance with grant conditions and receipt of credits. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's expected one-time refunds totaling $6,314,468, are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an employee retention credit receivable, as well as on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a credit to salaries and benefits expense.
We expect to receive the employee retention credit payment in 2022. Upon receipt, we expect to allocate these funds towards a combination of further investment in our team members, growth investments, capital expenditures, and deferred maintenance capital spending.
OPERATIONS REVIEW
YEAR ENDED December 31, 2021 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED December 31, 2020
EBITDA represents earnings before interest income, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We present EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure for our Racetrack Operations because it is a widely used measure of performance of and basis for valuation of companies in the gaming industry. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA differently than we do. We also compute Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, which reflects additional adjustments to Net Income to eliminate unusual or non-recurring items, as well as items relating to our real estate development operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA excluded the gain on sale of land, employee retention credit, depreciation, amortization, and interest related to equity investments, as well as $515,000 of COVID-19 relief grants included in other revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA excluded the loss on disposal of assets, gain on transfer of land, depreciation, amortization, and interest related to equity investments.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, a GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (defined above), which are non-GAAP measures, for the years ended:
SUMMARY OF EBITDA DATA
Adjusted EBITDA increased $12,665,000, or 1,571.5%, for 2021 compared to 2020. For 2021, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, excluding $515,000 other revenue from COVID-19 relief grants, was 22.5%.
REVENUES
Total net revenues for 2021 were $60,400,000, an increase of $27,259,000, or 82.3%, compared to total net revenues of $33,140,000 for 2020. For 2021 as compared to 2020, total pari-mutuel revenue increased 28.4%, Card Casino revenue increased 91.5%, food and beverage revenue increased 160.7%, and other revenue increased 102.6%. See below for a further discussion of our sources of revenues for each of our pari-mutuel, Card Casino, food and beverage, and other revenues.
PARI-MUTUEL REVENUES
Simulcast and Live Racing pari-mutuel revenues include commission and breakage revenues from on-track live and simulcast wagering. We receive guest fees from out-of-state racetracks and ADW companies for out-of-state wagering on our live races. Other revenues include source market fees paid by ADW companies for wagers made by Minnesota residents on out-of-state races and proceeds from unredeemed pari-mutuel tickets.
Total 2021 pari-mutuel revenue increased $2,265,000, or 28.4%, compared to 2020. The increase in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 is due to increased business levels, including the fact we returned to normalized operations and full capacity starting in the second quarter 2021 as compared to the closure of our operations for approximately 17 weeks in 2020 and operating our live racing season at a limited capacity.
CARD CASINO REVENUES
The primary source of Card Casino revenue is a percentage of the wagers received from the players as compensation for providing the Card Casino facility and services, referred to as “collection revenue.” Other Revenue presented above includes fees collected for the administration of tournaments and amounts earned as reimbursement of the administrative costs of maintaining jackpot funds. Card Casino revenue represented 63.1% and 60.0% of the Company’s net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total Card Casino revenue increased $18,205,000, or 91.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is due to increased visitation as our business recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic described above, as well as increased table games drop from the successful marketing efforts to recruit higher value players. When the Company reopened its table games operations on June 15, 2020, this included reduced seating at table games and capacity limitations to follow Minnesota state guidelines. The Company did not resume poker operations until July 2020. Our Card Casino also began operating without capacity restrictions effective May 28, 2021, but we maintained and intend to maintain certain operational changes and improvements, which we believe is preferred by players and is contributing to increased revenue and margins.
FOOD AND BEVERAGE REVENUES
Food and beverage revenue increased $3,813,000, or 160.7%, to $6,186,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is due to increased visitation as our business recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic described above. Furthermore, the increase is due to being able to host large scale events, including a three-day music festival and seven-show concert series in the 2021 third quarter, as well as the fact the Company's entire 2020 live racing season consisted of limited crowds due to capacity constraints. As noted above, all capacity limits which had been implemented as a response to the COVID-19 Pandemic were lifted on May 28, 2021.
OTHER REVENUES
Other revenue increased $2,977,000, or 102.6%, to $5,879,000 in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is due to the reversal of the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic described above, as well as hosting a three-day music festival and seven-show concert series in the 2021 third quarter. Additionally, the Company received $515,000 of COVID-19 relief grants that the Company recorded as other revenue in the 2021 first quarter.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Total operating expenses increased $8,000,000, or 22.9%, to $42,882,000 in 2021, from $34,882,000 in 2020. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 71.0% in 2021 from 105.3% in 2020.
Total purse expense increased $3,091,000, or 62.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is due to increases in Card Casino and pari-mutuel revenues. This also resulted in an increase in Minnesota Breeders' Fund (the "MBF") expense (shown below). As discussed in greater detail in Item 1 above, Minnesota law requires us to allocate a portion of Card Casino revenues, wagering handle on simulcast and live horse races, and ADW source market fees for future payment as purses for live horse races and other authorized uses. While most of these amounts were paid into the purse funds for thoroughbred and quarter horse races, Minnesota law requires that a portion of the amounts allocated for purses be paid into the MBF.
Salaries and benefits expense decreased $821,000, or 5.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease is due a $6,314,000 employee retention credit claimed under the CARES Act. Excluding the employee retention credit, salaries and benefits expense increased $5,493,000, or 34.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is due to an increase in the number of personnel to support our resumption of normalized operations in 2021 as well as the fact that the majority of employees were placed on an unpaid furlough during the temporary shutdown of operations in 2020.
Cost of food and beverage sales increased $1,206,000, or 98.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is consistent with the increase in food and beverage revenues.
Advertising and marketing costs increased $1,300,000, or 344.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to the increased expenditures that are funded by payments received under the CMA for joint marketing, as well as an increase in advertising and marketing spend to support our resumption of normalized operations in 2021.
Other operating expenses increased $1,241,000, or 34.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to the expenses associated with the three-day musical festival and seven-show concert series held in 2021, as well as a return to a more normalized live racing season in 2021.
During 2021, the Company recorded a gain on sale of land of $264,000 as of result of the sale of approximately 9.8 acres of land for approximately $3,500,000 in gross proceeds.
During 2020, the Company recorded a gain on transfer of land of $2,368,000 as a result of transferring land to the Doran Canterbury II and Canterbury DBSV joint ventures.
The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3,999,000 and a benefit for income taxes of $1,251,000 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in our tax expense for 2021 compared to 2020 is due to an increase in income before taxes from operations. Our effective tax rate was 25.3% and (662.4%) for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 2020 effective tax rate was impacted by benefits realized from the 2019 and 2020 NOL carrybacks calculated in the 2020 tax provision.
Net income for the years 2021 and 2020 was $11,798,000 and $1,062,000, respectively.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts - Property Tax Increment Financing "TIF" Receivable
As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a TIF receivable on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $12,503,000, which represents $11,180,000 of principal and $1,323,000 of interest. The TIF receivable requires significant management estimates and judgement pertaining to whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. The TIF receivable was generated in connection with the Contract for Private Redevelopment, in which the City of Shakopee has agreed that a portion of the future tax increment revenue generated from the developed property around the Racetrack will be paid to the Company to reimburse it for expenses in constructing public infrastructure improvements.
The Company typically performs an annual collectability analysis of the TIF receivable in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential uncollectability exist. The Company utilizes the assistance of a third party to assist with the projected tax increments. The quantitative analysis includes assumptions based on the market values of the completed development projects within Canterbury Commons, which derives the future projected tax increment revenue. The Company uses the analysis to determine if the future tax increment revenue will exceed the Company's development costs on infrastructure improvements. As a result of our analysis for the year ended December 31, 2021, management believes the TIF receivable will be fully collectible and no allowance related to this receivable is necessary.
COOPERATIVE MARKETING AGREEMENT
The amounts received from the marketing payments under the CMA are recorded as a component of other revenue and the related expenses are recorded as a component of advertising and marketing expense and depreciation in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $1,516,000 in other revenue and incurred $1,391,000 in advertising and marketing expense and $125,000 in depreciation related to the SMSC marketing payment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $900,000 in other revenue and incurred $740,000 in advertising and marketing expense and $160,000 in depreciation related to the SMSC marketing payment. The excess of amounts received over revenue is reflected as deferred revenue on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
CONTINGENCIES
The Company entered into a CMA with the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community that became effective on June 4, 2012 and has been amended, as discussed above. The CMA contains certain covenants that, if breached, would trigger an obligation to repay a specified amount related to such covenant. At this time, management believes that the likelihood that the breach of a covenant will occur and that the Company will be required to pay the specified amount related to such covenant is remote.
Effective on December 21, 2021, the Company entered into a Contribution and Indemnity Agreement ("Indemnity Agreement") with affiliates of Doran Companies ("Doran") in connection with the debt refinancing on the Doran Canterbury I, LLC joint venture. Under the Indemnity Agreement, the Company is obligated to indemnify Doran for loan payment amounts up to $5,000,000 only if the lender demands a loan guarantee.
The Company is periodically involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the resolution of any pending claims and legal actions at December 31, 2021 and as of the date of this report will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company has committed to payment of statutory distributions under a $500,000 bond issued to the MRC as required under Minnesota law. The Company was not required to make any payments related to this bond in 2021 or 2020, and there is no liability related to this bond on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Cash provided by operating activities for 2021 was $13,498,000 as a result of net income of $11,798,000 and was increased by 2021 noncash charges from depreciation of $2,845,000, stock-based compensation expense of $548,000, stock-based employee match contribution of $557,000, and loss from equity investment of $2,703,000. Cash from operating activities in 2021 was reduced by a gain on sale of land of $264,000. The Company also experienced an increase in Card Casino accruals of $929,000 and a decrease in income taxes receivable of $2,768,000 in 2021 as compared to 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in payable to horsepersons of $1,451,000, an increase in TIF receivable of $614,000, and an increase in employee retention credit receivable of $6,314,000. We expect to receive the employee retention credit payment in 2022. Upon receipt, we expect to allocate these funds towards a combination of further investment in our team members, growth investments, capital expenditures, and deferred maintenance capital spending.
Cash provided by operating activities for 2020 was $1,130,000 as a result of net income of $1,062,000 and was increased by 2020 noncash charges from depreciation of $2,749,000, stock-based compensation expense of $469,000, stock-based employee match contribution of $371,000, deferred income taxes of $2,943,000, and loss from equity investment of $1,478,000. Cash from operating activities in 2020 was reduced by a gain on transfer of land of $2,368,000. The Company also experienced an increase in payable to horsepersons of $1,817,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. This was partially offset by a decrease in accrued wages and payroll taxes of $1,104,000, decrease in deferred revenue of $1,046,000, increase in TIF receivable of $547,000, and increase in income taxes receivable of $4,153,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019.
CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Net cash used in investing activities for 2021 of $2,502,000 was used primarily for additions to land, buildings, and equipment, increase in related party receivable, and an equity investment contribution. This was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of land.
Net cash used in investing activities for 2020 of $211,000 was used primarily for additions to land, buildings, and equipment, including the costs of TIF eligible public infrastructure improvements. This was partially offset by a decrease in related party receivables when an affiliate of the controlling member of the Doran Canterbury I and II joint ventures repaid the $2,940,000 promissory note in full on August 3, 2020 and repaid the $268,000 of costs for preliminary grading work on parcels of land the Company had designated for Doran Canterbury II.
CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2021 was $130,000 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by payments for taxes of equity awards. Given that we reinstituted our quarterly cash dividend in January 2022, we expect net cash used by financing activities to increase in 2022.
Net cash used by financing activities for 2020 was $374,000 and primarily consisted of $329,000 cash dividend paid to shareholders prior to the suspension of dividends by our Board of Directors on March 16, 2020.
CASH AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $15,599,000 compared to $4,472,000 at December 31, 2020. This $11,127,000 increase consisted of $13,498,000 of net cash provided by operating activities and $130,000 of net cash provided by financing activities, offset by $2,502,000 of net cash used in investing activities. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flow from operations and availability of borrowing under our revolving line of credit agreement, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and working capital requirements beyond the next 12 months.
The Company has a general credit and security agreement with a financial institution. This agreement was amended as of December 23, 2020 to extend the maturity date to February 28, 2021. The agreement was also amended as of February 28, 2021 to extend the maturity date to January 31, 2024 and increase its revolving credit line up to $10,000,000. The line of credit is collateralized by all receivables, inventory, equipment, and general intangibles of the Company, as well as a mortgage on certain real property. The Company had no borrowings under the credit line during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance on the line of credit was $0. The credit agreement contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with these requirements at all times throughout 2021.
Our three largest sources of revenue: pari-mutuel wagering, Card Casino operations, and food and beverage, are all based on cash transactions. Consequently, we have significant inflows of cash on a daily basis. We designate cash balances that will be required to satisfy certain short-term liabilities such as progressive jackpots, the player pool, and amounts due horsemen for purses and awards as “restricted” as a separate balance sheet item.
The Company offers unbanked table games that refer to a wagering system or game where wagers “lost” or “won” by the host are accumulated into a “player pool” to enhance the total amount paid back to players in any other card game. The Company is required to return accumulated player pool funds to the players through giveaways, promotional items, prizes or by other means. The player pool liability was $973,000 and $576,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, the table games jackpot pool was $675,000 and $664,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company also maintains a poker promotional pool where a portion of the poker "rake" is collected and accumulated into a promotional pool to enhance the total amount paid back to poker players. The Company is required to return accumulated poker promotional pool funds to the players through poker jackpots, giveaways, promotional items, prizes or by other means. The poker promotional pool liability was $934,000 and $631,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Card Casino offers progressive jackpots for poker games. Amounts collected for these jackpot funds are accrued as liabilities until paid to winners. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, accrued jackpot funds totaled $189,000 and $186,000, respectively. The MRC regulates the operation of the player pool and progressive jackpot pools. These liabilities have the potential for significant fluctuation on a daily basis.
All games in the Card Casino are played using chips. The value of chips issued and outstanding, referred to as the “outstanding chip liability,” was $475,000 and $253,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This liability has the potential for significant fluctuation on a daily basis depending upon the demand for chip redemptions and sales.
Our second largest individual operating expense item is purse expense. Pursuant to an agreement with the MHBPA, we transferred into a trust account or paid directly to the MHBPA, approximately $8,903,000 and $2,885,000 in purse funds related to thoroughbred races for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Minnesota law provides that amounts transferred into this trust account are the property of the trust and not the Company. There were no unpaid purse fund obligations due to the MHBPA at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
In March 2014, the Company entered into a seven-year agreement with a new totalizator provider, which was extended an additional year in 2021. Pursuant to the agreement, the vendor provides totalizator equipment and related software that records and processes all wagers and calculates odds and payoffs. The amounts charged to operations for totalizator expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $262,000 and $181,000, respectively.
In August 2018, the Company entered into a Contract for Private Redevelopment with the City of Shakopee in connection with a Tax Increment Financing District (“TIF District”). The Company is obligated to construct certain public infrastructure improvements within the TIF District, and will be reimbursed by the City of Shakopee by future tax increment revenue generated from the developed property. See Note 12 for a more detailed description of the agreement.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
From time-to-time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, and in other communications to shareholders or the investing public, we may make forward-looking statements concerning possible or anticipated future financial performance, prospective business activities or plans that are typically preceded by words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends” or similar expressions. For these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in federal securities laws. Shareholders and the investing public should understand that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
