MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
OVERVIEW
Please refer to Item 1. Business for a general discussion of our business strategy, competitive strengths and a general description of the assets contained in our four business segments and Item 2. Properties for details regarding the asset type, size, location and key metrics about our various properties.
The following section highlights significant activities and financial results for the Company and its segments during 2021. Performance for each of our business segments is more fully described hereinafter (all items are pre-tax unless otherwise noted).
Douglas Ranch Acquisition In October 2021, HHC announced the launch of Douglas Ranch, a new large-scale master planned community in the West Valley of Phoenix, Arizona. The Company closed on the all-cash purchase of approximately 33,810 acres for a purchase price of $541.0 million. The purchase price includes an option for the seller, JDM Partners, to re-acquire a 50% interest in the property for an additional $236.8 million, with $33.8 million of the original purchase price being credited to the seller upon exercise of the option for a total capital contribution of $270.6 million. If the option is not exercised by the seller, the $33.8 million will be returned to the Company. Simultaneous with the land acquisition, the Company closed on the acquisition of a 50% interest in Trillium Development Holding Company, LLC, for $59.0 million. Trillium Development Holding Company, LLC owns approximately 3,029 acres of land in the greater Phoenix, Arizona area. Trillium is Douglas Ranch’s first village to begin development with land sales expected to occur in the first half of 2022. In total, the Douglas Ranch MPC encompasses almost 37,000 fully-entitled, “shovel-ready” acres and is poised for growth with in-place entitlements for 100,000 residential homes and 55 million square feet of commercial development.
COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of COVID-19 impacted global economic activity in early 2020 and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The impact of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resurgence of cases related to new variants, led to a wide variety of government-issued control measures, including states of emergency, required business and school closures, shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions, resulted in a negative impact on our financial performance in 2020, particularly in our Operating Asset and Seaport segments. Many states began easing quarantine protocols near the end of the second quarter of 2020, which allowed most of our retail and hospitality properties to resume operations on a limited basis. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact us will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, such as the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments and their deployment, potential mutations of COVID-19, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures.
While the impact of COVID-19 affected all of our business segments throughout 2020 and continued to impact the Company into 2021, we saw significant performance improvement during the second half of 2020 that has continued through 2021. Notably, during 2021, we achieved Operating Asset NOI of $218.7 million and MPC EBT of $316.6 million. This represents a $39.1 million increase in Operating Asset NOI and a $107.2 million increase in MPC EBT, as compared to 2020. In Ward Village, we closed on 670 condominium units, including 663 units at the newly completed ‘A‘ali‘i tower, and contracted to sell 144 condominium units at our under-construction towers, Kō'ula and Victoria Place. In July 2021, we began public sales at our eighth condominium project, The Park Ward Village, which was 84.2% presold as of December 31, 2021. We also completed the sale of Monarch City in Collin County, Texas, our three hospitality properties in The Woodlands, Texas and Century Park in Houston, Texas, for combined net proceeds after debt repayment of $195.6 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021, to the year ended December 31, 2020
Total Company
-Net income attributable to common stockholders increased to $56.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $26.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
-We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position with $843.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and available capacity of $85 million on the revolver portion of our credit facilities as of December 31, 2021, with limited near-term debt maturities.
-During 2021, we completed the sale of Monarch City, our three hospitality properties in The Woodlands and Century Park for net proceeds after debt repayment of $195.6 million. Since the fourth quarter of 2019, we have completed the sales of 13 non-core assets generating approximately $401.0 million of net proceeds after debt repayment.
Operating Assets
-Operating Assets NOI totaled $218.7 million in 2021, a $39.1 million or 21.8% increase compared to $179.6 million in the prior year.
-Retail NOI increased $17.6 million, primarily due to improving rent collections of 82.4% due to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the receipt of one-time payments related to COVID-19 rent deferrals received throughout the year.
-Multi-family NOI increased $14.1 million, primarily due to accelerated lease-up in our latest developments, including Two Lakes Edge at 99.7% leased, The Lane at Waterway at 99.4% leased and Juniper Apartments at 97.1% leased, which all opened in 2020 and are already stabilized.
-Other property NOI increased $11.0 million, primarily due to the return of the Las Vegas Aviators 2021 baseball season. Las Vegas Ballpark generated $6.0 million of NOI as the Las Vegas Aviators were able to host a full Minor League Baseball season compared to a $3.6 million loss in 2020 due to no Minor League Baseball season as a result of COVID-19.
-Office NOI decreased $4.5 million, primarily related to the planned expiration in June 2020 of a short-term lease for approximately 142,000 square feet at The Woodlands Towers at the Waterway which is being actively marketed.
-Hospitality NOI increased $2.0 million, prior to disposition of these properties in September 2021.
MPC
-MPC EBT totaled $316.6 million in 2021, a $107.2 million or 51.2% increase compared to $209.4 million in the prior year.
-The increase in EBT was primarily due to higher land sales revenues at Summerlin due to an increase in superpad and custom lot sales and higher Equity in earnings (losses) from real estate and other affiliates at The Summit due to an increase in the number of units sold in 2021 and the impact of increased amenity cost and higher unit completion cost in the prior-year period that did not repeat in 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower land sales revenues at The Woodlands due to the lack of available land as the community reaches completion.
Seaport
-Seaport EBT increased $41.6 million to a loss of $58.4 million, compared to a loss of $100.0 million in the prior year.
-The increase in EBT was primarily due to several items in 2020 that did not reoccur in 2021, including a loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense due to the early repayment of the $250 million Seaport loan in August 2020, charges in the first quarter of 2020 related to write-offs of building improvements and retail inventory due to the permanent closure of 10 Corso Como Retail and Café and an impairment charge of $6.0 million for the Company’s equity investment in Mr. C Seaport in the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, net of an increase in segment revenues, as a result of increased activity in 2021 as business resumed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
-Seaport NOI decreased $1.1 million to a loss of $17.6 million, primarily due increased expenses related to the reopening of businesses following the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increased marketing costs, partially offset by the launch of new restaurant concepts and the reintroduction of the Seaport Summer Concert Series.
-Construction of the core and shell of the Tin Building is complete and the marketplace is expected to have its grand opening in the first half of 2022.
-In December 2021, we obtained final approval from the City of New York to transform the one-acre parking lot at 250 Water Street into a mixed-use development that will include multi-family rental units, office and retail space.
HHC 2021 FORM 10-K | 40
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
-Also in December 2021, we secured ground lease extension options at the Seaport for an additional 48 years from its current expiration in 2072 until 2120.
Strategic Developments
-Strategic Developments EBT totaled income of $83.8 million in 2021, a $94.0 million decrease compared to income of $177.8 million in the prior year.
-The decrease in EBT was primarily due to the deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker in the third quarter of 2020. As part of the deconsolidation, a gain of $267.5 million was recognized in Equity in earnings (losses) from real estate and other affiliates and an additional $15.4 million of previously eliminated 110 North Wacker development fees were recognized in Other land, rental and property revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net condominium sales of $121.4 million driven by timing of condominium closings.
-We completed construction at ‘A‘ali‘i and began welcoming residents in October 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we closed on 663 units, totaling $453.3 million in net revenue.
-We contracted to sell 144 condominium units during 2021 at our two under construction towers, Kō'ula and Victoria Place. Victoria Place, which began construction in February 2021, accounted for 78 of the units contracted during the quarter and was 99.1% presold as of December 31, 2021, with only 3 units remaining to be sold.
-The Park Ward Village, our eighth condominium project at Ward Village, began public sales in July 2021 and as of December 31, 2021, we have entered into contracts for 459 units, representing 84.2% of total units. The Park Ward Village is now Ward Village’s fastest-selling tower since inception, surpassing Victoria Place, which held the previous record.
-During 2021, we placed Creekside Park The Grove, a multi-family property in The Woodlands, in service upon substantial completion of construction. We began construction on the following assets in 2021: (i) Marlow, a multi-family property in Columbia; (ii) Victoria Place, our seventh condominium project in Ward Village; (iii) Tanager Echo, a multi-family property in Summerlin; (iv) 1700 Pavilion, an office property in Summerlin; and (v) Memorial Hermann Health System Build-to-Suit, an office property in The Woodlands. These under construction assets represent 1,124 multi-family units, 349 condominium units and 319,000 square feet of office and retail space.
Corporate
-Net expenses related to Corporate income, expenses and other items increased $43.3 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of the Company’s $1.0 billion 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025 during the first quarter of 2021, higher corporate interest expense, net primarily as a result of the issuance of $750 million 5.375% Senior Notes in August 2020, as well as the issuance of $650 million 4.125% Senior Notes and $650 million 4.375% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2021, offset by the repurchase of the $1.0 billion 5.375% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2021. These increases in net expenses were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses related to workforce reductions and other corporate initiatives, which are part of an overall plan to reduce recurring overhead costs, and a decrease in consulting expenses as a result of fewer IT projects taking place in 2021.
Capital and Financing Activities
-In 2021, we closed on $2.1 billion of permanent financings, replacing $2.1 billion of existing debt, and closed on $628 million of construction financings to support development spending at our latest projects actively under construction. These financings extended the term of our maturities and took advantage of a historically low rate environment. Refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
-In October 2021, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to $250.0 million of its common stock. The Company repurchased $96.6 million as of December 31, 2021, and completed all authorized purchases under the plan in the first quarter of 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Operating Assets
Office and Multi-family We have seen continued strength in the performance of our office and multi-family assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected 98.8% of our office portfolio billings and 98.2% of our multi-family portfolio billings.
Retail Beginning in April 2020, we experienced the temporary closure of all non-essential retail in Summerlin, Houston and Ward Village, and the complete closure of the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk. Several of our tenants were able to resume limited operations in May and June 2020, and the majority of our tenants had reopened by the end of the third quarter of 2020. As a result of these closures, collections of our retail portfolio billings reached a low of 49.7% during the three months ended June 30, 2020, but increased to 72.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2020. This trend continued throughout 2021 with collections increasing each quarter and reaching 88.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and 82.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of improved collections and continued recovery as business rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, Retail NOI increased to $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $17.6 million increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Hospitality At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, we temporarily closed all three of our hospitality properties. The Woodlands Resort reopened in May 2020, the Embassy Suites reopened in June 2020 and The Westin at The Woodlands reopened in July 2020. As a result, occupancy levels rose throughout the second half of 2020 and into 2021 but remained lower than levels achieved prior to the pandemic. On September 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of all three hospitality assets for $252.0 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $39.1 million. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.
Las Vegas Aviators The Minor League Baseball season was canceled for 2020, which impacted the Las Vegas Aviators, our Triple-A professional baseball team. Following the 2021 restructuring of Minor League Baseball, the Las Vegas Aviators are participating in the Triple-A West Professional Development League. The team began the 2021 season in May at 50% capacity and were able to operate at 100% capacity through the third quarter of 2021. As a result, NOI has increased substantially from a loss of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to income of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
MPC New home sales in our MPC locations, a leading indicator of land sales, dropped considerably in April of 2020 as a result of stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic, but experienced large upticks in May through December of 2020. In response, we restarted horizontal development to maintain a sufficient supply of lots and superpads to keep up with the strong home sales. Home sales remained strong through 2021, with 2,761 new homes sold in our MPCs for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the 2,724 new homes sold in our MPCs for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the total acres of residential land sold across all our MPCs increased 50% in the year ended December 31, 2021 to 565 acres, compared to 377 acres in the prior-year period.
In October 2021, the Company announced the acquisition of Douglas Ranch and Trillium, an almost 37,000-acre fully-entitled, “shovel-ready” MPC location in Phoenix’s West Valley for approximately $600 million. Douglas Ranch is poised for growth with in-place entitlements for 100,000 residential homes and 55 million square feet of commercial development. Land sales are expected to commence at Trillium, Douglas Ranch’s first village, in the first half of 2022. Trillium will be developed and managed through a joint venture.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Seaport In response to the pandemic, we completely closed the Seaport and halted construction on the Tin Building in March 2020. Social distancing restrictions also resulted in cancellation of our 2020 Seaport summer concert series. While restrictions remained in place throughout 2020 and into 2021, many of the businesses within the Seaport were able to resume operations, on a limited basis, in the third quarter of 2020. Most restrictions were lifted in June of 2021; however, many businesses at the Seaport continued to operate at reduced levels through the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to labor shortages. All venues were open and operating at close to full capacity during the fourth quarter of 2021. Construction on the Tin Building resumed in May 2020 and the core and shell of the building was completed as of December 31, 2021. The Tin Building is expected to open in the first half of 2022, with an expanded focus on in-person dining, retail shopping, mobile ordering and delivery. We are closely monitoring our revenues and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we have collected 98.0% of our $4.8 million of office portfolio billings and a nominal amount of our $4.2 million of retail portfolio billings as we have restructured many leases as a result of the impacts of the pandemic.
In April 2021, Momofuku reopened the Ssäm Bar in the space previously occupied by its former concept, Bar Wayō. Additionally, Andrew Carmellini’s Noho Hospitality opened Mister Dips in May 2021 and Carne Mare in June 2021.
In 2020, in place of the cancelled summer concert series, we launched a new concept at the Pier 17 rooftop called The Greens, which allowed guests to reserve socially distanced, mini-lawn spaces. These lawn spaces were converted to individual dining cabins in the winter months. In 2021, the Seaport welcomed live events back to the Rooftop at Pier 17. Our first major event, following a COVID-related 16-month hiatus, was ESPN’s broadcast of The ESPYS, which returned to New York for the first time in 22 years. In 2021, we also reintroduced The Greens on the Rooftop at Pier 17 with new and improved versions of both the summer mini-lawns and winter cabins. In anticipation of the return of concerts to Pier 17, the newly designed mini-lawns were fabricated as deployable units that could be easily removed for concerts and returned to the Rooftop on off days allowing for very limited downtime.
Following The ESPYS, live music returned to Pier 17 with the reintroduction of the Seaport Summer Concert Series. The 2021 summer concert series began in July 2021 and ran through mid-October 2021. During the 11-week concert season, Pier 17 hosted over 30 concerts, of which 20 were sold out. In total, approximately 74,000 guests attended the concert series, representing 90% of available ticket inventory.
In July 2021, we completed a brand overhaul for the Seaport including new identity, updated logo and complimenting ad campaign. The creative work was well received in the community and won DRIVENxDESIGN’s Silver Award for Graphic Design, Illustration and Type. Across the Seaport, we executed a series of dynamic activations in vacant and public spaces to drive additional traffic and awareness to the Seaport. Finally, our Seaport Arts platform launched with two marquee exhibits, both of which drew tremendous global attention to the Seaport and elevated our profile as a destination for dynamic exhibitions by world class photographers.
We have also announced the future opening of two new concepts at the Fulton Market Building in the space previously occupied by 10 Corso Como. In the summer of 2022, in a joint partnership with Endorphin Ventures, we expect to launch The Lawn Club, a new concept that will transform 20,000 square feet of the Fulton Market Building into an immersive indoor and outdoor experience that includes an extensive indoor grass area, a stylish clubhouse bar and a wide variety of lawn games. We also expect to launch a new restaurant concept by Josh Eden and Wylie Dufresne at 1 Fulton Street featuring an all-day menu with many specialty to-go items and an expansive outdoor café in the summer of 2022.
In October 2020, we announced our comprehensive proposal for the redevelopment of 250 Water Street, which includes the transformation of this underutilized full-block surface parking lot into a mixed-use development that would include affordable and market rate apartments, community-oriented spaces and office space. This project, which includes approximately 547,000 zoning square feet, presents a unique opportunity at the Seaport to redevelop this site into a vibrant mixed-use asset, provide long-term viability to the South Street Seaport Museum and deliver much-needed affordable housing and economic stimulus to the area. In May 2021, we received approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) on our proposed design for the 250 Water Street and in September 2021, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed on procedural grounds a lawsuit challenging the LPC approval. We received final approvals in December 2021 through the New York City Uniform Land Use Review Procedure known as ULURP, which will allow the necessary transfer of development rights to the parking lot site. Also in December 2021, an amendment to the Seaport ground lease was executed giving the Company extension options, at the discretion of the Company, for an additional 48 years from its current expiration in 2072 until 2120. We expect to begin comprehensive remediation of the site through the New York State Brownfield Cleanup program and break ground on the development in 2022. In February 2022, an additional lawsuit was filed challenging the land use approvals previously granted to the Company under the ULURP for the redevelopment and construction of 250 Water Street. The Company intends to vigorously contest the matter as it believes that these claims are without merit.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Strategic Developments Given the challenges presented by the pandemic, we implemented new strategies to sell condominiums in Hawai‘i, which included 3D virtual tours of interactive floor plans, live chat capabilities with sales staff, and increased photographs on our websites.
In 2021, Ward Village achieved the highest sales volume in the community’s history. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed construction on ‘A‘ali‘i and closed on 663 units. As of December 31, 2021, our five completed towers are 96.2% sold and our two under-construction towers are 93.1% sold. We also launched public sales at The Park Ward Village, which was 84.2% presold at the end of 2021. The Park Ward Village is now Ward Village’s fastest-selling tower since inception, surpassing Victoria Place, which held the previous record.
We have not experienced any delays in our existing construction as a result of COVID-19, other than the brief delay of construction on the Tin Building discussed above. In December 2020, we began construction on Starling at Bridgeland, a luxury multi-family development in Bridgeland. During the first quarter of 2021, we began construction on Marlow, a multi-family development in Columbia, and Victoria Place, our seventh condominium project in Ward Village. During the second quarter of 2021 in Downtown Summerlin, we began construction on 1700 Pavilion, an office building and Tanager Echo, a luxury apartment complex. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we began construction on Memorial Hermann Health System Build-to-Suit, a medical office property in The Woodlands. Additionally, we began construction on a second medical office property in The Woodlands in January 2022, and expect to begin construction on a new medical office property in Columbia and our first single-family for rent property in Bridgeland in the first quarter of 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
In addition to the required presentations using GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results and make comparisons of operating results among peer companies more meaningful. Management continually evaluates the usefulness, relevance, limitations and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.
Because our four segments, Operating Assets, MPC, Seaport and Strategic Developments, are managed separately, we use different operating measures to assess operating results and allocate resources among them. The one common operating measure used to assess operating results for our business segments is EBT. EBT, as it relates to each business segment, represents the revenues less expenses of each segment, including interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings of real estate and other affiliates. EBT excludes corporate expenses and other items that are not allocable to the segments. See discussion herein at Corporate income, expenses and other items for further details. We present EBT for each segment because we use this measure, among others, internally to assess the core operating performance of our assets.
EBT should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders or GAAP net income, as it has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBT are that it does not include the following in our calculations:
-cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments
-corporate general and administrative expenses
-interest expense on our corporate debt
-income taxes that we may be required to pay
-any cash requirements for replacement of fully depreciated or amortized assets
-limitations on, or costs related to, the transfer of earnings from our real estate and other affiliates to us
Segment operating results are as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders increased $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020 and decreased $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. See segment discussions for more detail on the changes described above.
Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for Operating Assets for the years ended December 31:
For the year ended December 31, 2021:
Operating Assets segment EBT increased $40.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in Rental revenue and a decrease in (Provision for) recovery of doubtful accounts primarily as a result of improved collections at our retail properties in 2021 due to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the receipt of one-time payments related to COVID-19 rent deferrals received throughout the year
-increase in Rental revenue, net of related Operating costs, related to multi-family properties in The Woodlands and Columbia as well as office property in Columbia placed in service since the beginning of 2020
-increase in our Other land, rental and property revenues, net of related Operating Costs, primarily related to the return of the Las Vegas Aviators 2021 baseball season after cancellation in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
-gain on the sale of The Woodlands Resort, The Westin at The Woodlands and Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing in the third quarter of 2021
-decrease in interest expense due to the retirement or refinancing of various loans
-impairment on the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk in the first quarter of 2020 that did not reoccur in 2021
These increases to EBT were partially offset by the following:
-decrease in equity earnings related to 110 North Wacker, which was deconsolidated and recorded as an equity method investment upon completion of construction in the third quarter of 2020. Losses recognized in 2021 were primarily related to the disproportionate impact of interest expense, real estate taxes and depreciation expense during the lease-up period and an impairment on the Company’s equity investment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Please refer to Note 2 - Investments in Real Estate and Other Affiliates and Note 4 - Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.
-gain on the sale of 100 Fellowship Drive in the first quarter of 2020
-increase in Operating expenses primarily due to the steady return of business operations across our portfolio after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020
HHC 2021 FORM 10-K | 47
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
-increase in Other income (loss), net primarily related to a loss on the settlement of the rate-lock agreement upon repayment of $280.3 million outstanding on our loans for 1201 Lake Robbins and The Woodlands Warehouse in February 2021
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Operating Assets segment EBT decreased $120.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in the Provision for impairment of $48.7 million for Outlet Collection at Riverwalk, partially offset by an increase in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate related to the sale of 100 Fellowship Drive in the first quarter of 2020. Please refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 4 - Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.
-net decreases in our Other land, rental and property revenues and related Operating expenses primarily due to declines in occupancy at our hospitality properties and cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season, all as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
-net decreases in Rental revenue and related Operating expenses primarily due to rent deferrals and collection reserves related to our retail properties
-decrease in Selling profit from sales-type leases attributable to the commencement of a lease at our 100 Fellowship Drive property in the third quarter of 2019
-increase in Depreciation and amortization expense, Rental property real estate taxes, Interest expense, net, and Operating expenses, partially offset by Rental revenue related to office and multi-family assets recently acquired or placed in service, but still in the lease-up period
Net Operating Income We believe that NOI is a useful supplemental measure of the performance of our Operating Assets and Seaport segments because it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in rental and occupancy rates and operating costs as variances between years in NOI typically result from changes in rental rates, occupancy, tenant mix and operating expenses. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recoveries and other revenue) less operating expenses (real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, marketing and other property expenses). NOI excludes straight-line rents and amortization of tenant incentives, net; interest expense, net; ground rent amortization; demolition costs; other income (loss); amortization; depreciation; development-related marketing costs; gain on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net; provision for impairment and equity in earnings from real estate and other affiliates. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance on a property-by-property basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that property-specific factors such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our operating results, gross margins and investment returns.
Projected annual stabilized NOI is initially projected prior to the development of the asset based on market assumptions and is revised over the life of the asset as market conditions evolve. On a quarterly basis, each asset’s annualized NOI is compared to its projected stabilized NOI in conjunction with forecast data to determine if an adjustment is needed. Adjustments to an asset’s stabilized NOI are made when changes to the asset's long-term performance are thought to be more than likely and permanent.
Although we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors about the performance of our Operating Assets and Seaport segments, due to the exclusions noted above, NOI should only be used as an additional measure of the financial performance of such assets and not as an alternative to GAAP net income. A reconciliation of Operating Assets segment EBT to Operating Assets NOI is presented in the table below. Refer to the Seaport section for a reconciliation of Seaport segment EBT to Seaport NOI.

The below table presents Operating Assets NOI by property type:
For the year ended December 31, 2021:
Operating Assets NOI increased $39.1 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following:
-increase at our retail properties as collections improve and business rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic
-increase at our multi-family properties primarily related to the lease-up of Juniper Apartments, Two Lakes Edge and The Lane at Waterway which opened in 2020
-increase at our other properties primarily related to the return of the Las Vegas Aviators 2021 baseball season after cancellation in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
-partially offset by a decrease in revenue on our office properties primarily related to the planned expiration in June 2020 of a short-term lease for approximately 142,000 square feet at The Woodlands Towers at the Waterway, which is being actively marketed
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Operating Assets NOI decreased $26.0 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the following:
-decreases at our hospitality and other properties primarily due to declines in occupancy at our hospitality properties and cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season, all as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
-decreases at our retail properties primarily due to rent deferrals and collection reserves
-decrease related to the third quarter 2019 commencement of a lease at our 100 Fellowship Drive property which was sold in the first quarter of 2020
-partially offset by an increase in revenue on our office properties recently acquired or placed in service

Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for MPC Assets for the years ended December 31:
(a)Land sales include deferred revenue from land sales closed in a previous period which met criteria for recognition in the current period.
(b)Builder price participation revenue is based on an agreed-upon percentage of the sales price of homes closed relative to the base lot price which was paid by the homebuilders to us. This revenue fluctuates based upon the number and the prices of homes closed that qualify for builder price participation payments.
(c)Interest expense, net reflects the amount of interest that is capitalized at the project level. Negative interest expense amounts relate to interest capitalized relating to debt assigned to our Operating Assets segment and corporate debt.
(d)Equity in earnings (losses) from real estate and other affiliates for Douglas Ranch reflects our share of earnings in our Trillium joint venture and for Summerlin our share of earnings in The Summit joint venture.
(e)The negative MPC segment EBT in Columbia in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was due to real estate taxes and administrative expenses. The negative MPC segment EBT in Douglas Ranch in 2021 was due to administrative expenses at Trillium as development of the community begins. Land sales are expected to occur in the first half of 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
MPC revenues vary between periods based on economic conditions and several factors including location, availability of land for sale, development density and residential or commercial use. Gross margin for each MPC will vary from period to period based on the locations of the land sold and the related costs associated with developing the land sold. Reported results differ significantly from actual cash flows generated principally because cost of sales for GAAP purposes is derived from margins calculated using carrying values, projected future improvements and other capitalized project costs in relation to projected future land sale revenues. Carrying values generally represent acquisition and development costs reduced by any previous impairment charges. Development expenditures are capitalized and generally not reflected in the Statements of Operations in the current period. Accordingly, Cost of sales - land includes both actual and estimated future costs allocated based upon relative sales value to the lots or land parcels in each of the villages and neighborhoods in our MPCs.
For the year ended December 31, 2021:
MPC Segment EBT increased $107.2 million to $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the following results by MPC:
Bridgeland
-Residential land sales revenues remained consistent with 2020, with 158.1 residential acres sold compared to 169.1 acres in 2020. The average price per residential acre increased by $29,000 to $468,000 per acre.
-Commercial land sales increased $7.2 million compared to $2.2 million in commercial site sales, due to the sale of 41.5 acres more acres in 2021.
Summerlin
-Land sales revenues increased $124.8 million primarily due to higher superpad sales and custom lot sales. The increase in land sales revenues was partially offset by an increase in associated MPC cost of sales of $65.5 million.
-Summerlin’s residential land sales totaled 322.6 acres compared to 126.9 for the same period in 2020. The average price per acre for superpad sites for the year decreased by $82,000 to $656,000 per acre compared to the same period in 2020 due to the mix of lots sold.
-Revenues from custom lot sales increased due to an increase in average price for custom lots, which averaged approximately $43.88 per square foot in 2021 compared to $34.50 per square foot in 2020.
-Equity earnings at The Summit increased due to the closing of 46 units in 2021, compared to 29 units in 2020.
The Woodlands
-Land sales revenues decreased $20.4 million primarily due to a decrease in acres sold due to availability of land as the community reaches completion. The Woodlands sold 3.9 residential acres compared to 24.5 acres in 2020. The average price per residential acre decreased $455,000 to $618,000 per acre, primarily due to 2020 land sales occurring in a high-end, exclusive section of The Woodlands community that generated significantly higher value per acre in comparison.
The Woodlands Hills
-Land sales revenues increased $9.6 million due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. The Woodlands Hills sold 80.1 residential acres compared to 56.1 acres in 2020. The average price per acre increased $27,000 to $337,000 per acre.
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
MPC Segment EBT decreased $54.4 million to $209.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the following results by MPC:
Bridgeland
-Residential land sales revenues increased $12.9 million primarily due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. Bridgeland sold 169.1 residential acres compared to 150.3 acres in 2019. The average price per residential acre increased by $31,000 to $439,000 per acre.
-Commercial land sales increased $2.2 million from the sale of 16.6 acres compared to no commercial site sales in 2019.
HHC 2021 FORM 10-K | 53
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Summerlin
-Land sales revenues decreased $101.5 million primarily due to lower superpad sales and SID bond assumptions, partially offset by an increase in custom lot sales. The decrease in land sales revenues was partially offset by a decrease in associated MPC cost of sales of $38 million. The decrease in superpad sales in 2020 was primarily due to the acceleration of sales into 2019 as a result of increased demand from homebuilders and homebuyers.
-Revenues from custom lot sales increased due to an increase in quantity of lots sold despite a decrease in average price for custom lots, which averaged approximately $34.50 per square foot in 2020 compared to $39.00 per square foot in 2019.
-Summerlin’s residential land sales totaled 126.9 acres compared to 319.4 for the same period in 2019. The average price per acre for superpad sites for the year increased by $90,000 to $738,000 per acre compared to the same period in 2019 due to the mix of lots sold.
-Equity earnings at The Summit decreased due to an increase in projected amenity costs and the 2020 sales consisting of a greater mix of built units which have a lower margin than custom lot sales.
The Woodlands
-Land sales revenues decreased $16.6 million primarily due to a decrease in acres sold due to availability of land as the community reaches completion. The Woodlands sold 24.6 residential acres compared to 60.9 acres in 2019. The average price per residential acre increased $384,000 to $1.1 million per acre, primarily due to an increase in land sales in a high-end, exclusive section of The Woodlands community that generates significantly higher value per acre in comparison.
The Woodlands Hills
-Land sales revenues increased $6.3 million due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. The Woodlands Hills sold 56.1 residential acres compared to 40.2 acres in 2020. The average price per acre increased $34,000 to $310,000 per acre.
MPC Equity Investments
The Summit
Land development began at The Summit, our joint venture with Discovery Land, in the second quarter of 2015, and the development continues to progress. The golf course and related amenities were completed and opened to the members of the golf club in October 2017. The Club Tower Suites broke ground in March of 2019, and are completed as 15 of the 16 Suites closed escrow in 2021. Construction of the clubhouse has commenced with an expected delivery in 2023. Lot closings began in the second quarter of 2016, and a total of 202 lots have closed for $821.6 million through December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 46 residential units closed for $244.5 million, compared to 29 residential units closed for $155.7 million in 2020 and 20 residential units closed for $76.4 million in 2019 at The Summit, which offers a mix of custom lots, single family homes and clubhouse suites, sold by the joint venture. We recognized equity in earnings of $59.4 million in 2021, $17.8 million in 2020 and $28.3 million in 2019. We received cash distributions of $114.2 million in 2021, $6.0 million in 2020 and $16.1 million in 2019.

Although our business does not involve the sale or resale of homes, we believe that net new home sales are an important indicator of future demand for our superpad sites and finished lots. Therefore, we use this statistic where relevant in our discussion of MPC operating results herein. Net new home sales reflect home sales made by homebuilders, less cancellations. Cancellations generally occur when a homebuyer signs a contract to purchase a home but later fails to qualify for a home mortgage or is unable to provide an adequate down payment to complete the home sale.

Reconciliation of MPC Land Sales Closed to GAAP Land Sales Revenue The following table reconciles Total residential and commercial land sales closed in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 to Land sales revenue for the respective periods. Total net recognized (deferred) revenue includes revenues recognized in the current period which are related to sales closed in prior periods, offset by revenues deferred on sales closed in the current period.
Population growth, coupled with low mortgage interest rates, have led to continued demand for new homes in the Summerlin and Houston markets. Summerlin was ranked the third highest selling master planned community in the nation and also recognized as the “Best Selling MPC in Las Vegas” by RCLCO for 2021. Bridgeland was ranked the fifteenth highest selling master planned community in the nation and also recognized as the second highest selling master planned community in Texas by RCLCO for 2021. We expect demand to continue as home sales in high quality suburban communities continue to grow in 2022.
MPC Net Contribution In addition to MPC segment EBT, MPC Net Contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from EBT, adjusted for certain items as discussed below. Management uses this measure because it captures current period performance through the velocity of sales, as well as current period development expenditures based upon demand at our MPCs, which varies depending upon the stage of the MPCs development lifecycle, and the overall economic environment. MPC Net Contribution is defined as MPC segment EBT, plus MPC cost of sales, Depreciation and amortization, and net collections from SID bonds and MUD receivables, reduced by MPC development expenditures, land acquisitions and Equity in earnings from real estate and other affiliates, net of distributions. MPC Net Contribution is a non-GAAP operational metric and should not be used to measure operating performance of the MPC assets as a substitute for GAAP measures of such performance nor should it be used as a comparison metric with other comparable businesses. A reconciliation of segment EBT to MPC Net Contribution is presented below.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Seaport is part non-stabilized operating asset, part development project and part operating business. As such, the Seaport has a greater range of possible outcomes than our other projects. The greater uncertainty is largely the result of: (i) seasonality; (ii) potential sponsorship revenue; (iii) potential event revenue; and (iv) business operating risks from various start-up businesses. We operate and own, either directly, through license agreements or in joint ventures, many of the tenants in the Seaport, including retail stores and restaurants such as The Fulton by Jean-Georges, Ssäm Bar (formerly Bar Wayō), Malibu Farm, two concepts by Andrew Carmellini, Mister Dips and Carne Mare, The Greens at Pier 17 and the marketplace operated by Jean-Georges. As a result, the revenues and expenses of these businesses, as well as the underlying market conditions affecting these types of businesses, will directly impact the NOI of the Seaport. This is in contrast to our other retail properties where we primarily receive lease payments and are not as directly impacted by the operating performance of the underlying businesses. This causes the financial results and eventual stabilized yield of the Seaport to be less predictable than our other operating real estate assets with traditional lease structures. Further, as we open new operating businesses, either owned entirely or in partnership with third parties, we expect to incur pre-opening expenses and operating losses until those businesses stabilize, which likely will not happen until the Seaport reaches its critical mass of offerings. As a result of impacts related to COVID-19, there were delays in construction on the Tin Building; however, construction on the core and shell was completed as of the December 31, 2021. The Tin Building is expected to open in the first half of 2022, with an expanded focus on experiences including in-person dining, retail shopping, mobile ordering and delivery. Given the factors and uncertainties listed above combined with the continued impacts related to COVID-19, we do not currently provide guidance on our expected NOI yield and stabilization date for the Seaport. As we move closer to opening a critical mass of offerings at the Seaport, we will re-establish goals for yield on costs and stabilization dates when the uncertainties and range of possible outcomes are clearer.
We primarily categorize the businesses in the Seaport segment into three groups: landlord operations, managed businesses, and events and sponsorships. Landlord operations represent physical real estate we have developed and own, and is inclusive of our office, retail and multi-family properties.
Managed businesses represent retail and food and beverage businesses that HHC owns, either wholly or through partnerships with third parties, and operates, including license and management agreements. Our managed businesses include, among others, The Fulton, Cobble & Co., Mister Dips, Carne Mare, Malibu Farm and Ssäm Bar (formerly Bar Wayō). The Fulton, Cobble & Co. and Malibu Farm are managed by Creative Culinary Management Company, LLC, a Jean-Georges company, and Mister Dips and Carne Mare are managed by Seaport F&B LLC , an Andrew Carmellini company. These third party management companies are responsible for employment and supervision of all employees providing services for the food and beverage operations and restaurant as well as day-to-day operations and accounting for food and beverage operations.
In the summer of 2022, we plan to expand our managed business portfolio with the launch of The Lawn Club, a new concept that will transform 20,000 square feet of the Fulton Market Building into an immersive indoor and outdoor experience that includes an extensive indoor grass area, a stylish clubhouse bar and a wide variety of lawn games. We also expect to launch a new restaurant concept by Josh Eden and Wylie Dufresne at 1 Fulton Street featuring an all-day menu with many specialty to-go items and an expansive outdoor café in the summer of 2022.
Our events and sponsorship businesses include our concert series, an outdoor socially distanced space rental and dining concept at the Pier 17 rooftop called The Greens, event catering, private events and sponsorships. Food and beverage operations associated with The Greens, concert concessions and catering are operated under management agreements with Creative culinary. The Greens concept replaced the cancelled 2020 summer concert series and the Winterland skating and bar and continued through the end of the first quarter of 2021. The Greens concept returned in May 2021 to complement the 2021 summer concert series, which began in July 2021 and ran through mid-October 2021. During the 11-week concert season, Pier 17 hosted over 30 concerts, of which 20 were sold out. In total, approximately 74,000 guests attended the concert series, representing 90% of available ticket inventory. The Greens winter dining cabins returned in November 2021.

Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for the Seaport for the years ended December 31:
For the year ended December 31, 2021:
Seaport segment EBT loss decreased $41.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-loss on extinguishment of debt and decrease in interest expense due to the early repayment of the $250 million Seaport loan in August 2020
-charges in the first quarter of 2020 related to write-offs of building improvements recorded within Depreciation and amortization and retail inventory recorded within Other income (loss), net due to the permanent closure of 10 Corso Como Retail and Café that did not reoccur in 2021
-$6.0 million impairment of the Company’s equity investment in Mr. C Seaport in the second quarter of 2020
-increase in segment revenues, offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily as a result of increased activity in 2021 as business resumed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Seaport segment EBT loss increased $40.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-write-offs of retail inventory totaling $3.1 million recorded within Other income (loss), net and building improvements and other assets totaling $14.1 million recorded within Depreciation and amortization due to permanent closure of 10 Corso Como Retail and Café during the first quarter of 2020
-$11.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt upon retirement of the $250 million Seaport loan in August 2020
-$6.0 million impairment of the Company’s equity investment in Mr. C Seaport. Refer to Note 4 - Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.
-decreases in segment revenues were offset by decreases in segment operating expenses primarily as a result of business closures and cancellations of events related to the COVID-19 pandemic
-partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in Other income (loss), net due to liquidation sales of 10 Corso Como Retail inventory

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Operating Income A reconciliation of Seaport segment EBT to Seaport NOI is presented below:
(a)Includes miscellaneous development-related items as well as the loss related to the write-off of inventory due to the permanent closure of 10 Corso Como Retail and Café in the first quarter of 2020, and income related to inventory liquidation sales in the third quarter of 2020.
Including managed businesses, events, sponsorships, catering and the Tin Building, the Seaport is approximately 60% leased. We may continue to incur operating expenses in excess of rental revenues while the remaining available space is in lease-up. We expect to incur operating losses for our Seaport operations until the economy recovers from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Seaport reaches its critical mass of offerings.
The below table presents Seaport NOI by category:
Landlord Operations NOI decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to increased operating expenses as business resumed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new tenants and a full year of activations in event space, as well as increased marketing expenses related to a brand overhaul for the Seaport in 2021. As a portion of our leased space is occupied by tenant businesses we own and operate, revenue from these tenants is eliminated in consolidation and operating losses related to Landlord Operations are expected to continue until occupancy stabilizes.
Managed Business and Events, Sponsorships and Catering Business NOI increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to increased revenues, partially offset by increased operating expense related to the reopening of businesses following the COVID-19 pandemic; the launch of new restaurant concepts in 2021 including Mister Dips, Carne Mare and the reopening of the Ssäm Bar; as well as the reintroduction of the Seaport Summer Concert Series.
Seaport NOI decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily as a result of business closures and cancellations of events related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following describes the status of our major construction projects at the Seaport as of December 31, 2021:
Tin Building In January 2017, we executed a ground lease amendment with the City of New York, incorporating the Tin Building into our leased premises and modifying other related provisions. The project includes construction of a turn-key, interior fit-out for the marketplace space, leased by a joint venture with Jean-Georges Vongerichten, which will feature a variety of fresh specialty foods, seafood, exceptional dining experiences and other products. We have completed the reconstruction of the platform pier where the Tin Building previously stood and restoration of the building is well under way. As a result of impacts related to COVID-19, there were delays in construction on the Tin Building, however construction of the core and shell was completed as of December 31, 2021, and it is expected to open in the first half of 2022, with an expanded focus on in-person dining, retail shopping, mobile ordering and delivery.

250 Water Street We acquired 250 Water Street in the second quarter of 2018. This one-acre site, currently used as a parking lot, is at the entrance of the Seaport and encompasses a full city block bounded by Peck Slip, Pearl Street, Water Street and Beekman Street. In October 2020, we announced our comprehensive proposal for the redevelopment of 250 Water Street, which includes the transformation of this underutilized full-block surface parking lot into a mixed-use development that would include affordable and market rate apartments, community-oriented spaces and office space. This project, which includes approximately 547,000 zoning square feet, presents a unique opportunity at the Seaport to redevelop this site into a vibrant mixed-use asset, provide long-term viability to the South Street Seaport Museum and deliver much-needed affordable housing and economic stimulus to the area. In May 2021, we received approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) on our proposed design for the 250 Water Street and in September 2021, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed on procedural grounds a lawsuit challenging the LPC approval. We received final approvals in December 2021 through the New York City Uniform Land Use Review Procedure known as ULURP, which will allow the necessary transfer of development rights to the parking lot site. Also in December 2021, an amendment to the Seaport ground lease was executed giving the Company extension options, at the discretion of the Company, for an additional 48 years from its current expiration in 2072 until 2120. We expect to begin comprehensive remediation of the site through the New York State Brownfield Cleanup program and break ground on the development in 2022. In February 2022, an additional lawsuit was filed challenging the land use approvals previously granted to the Company under the ULURP for the redevelopment and construction of 250 Water Street. The Company intends to vigorously contest the matter as it believes that these claims are without merit.
Our Strategic Developments assets generally require substantial future development to maximize their value. Other than our condominium properties, most of the properties and projects in this segment do not generate revenues. Our expenses relating to these assets are primarily related to costs associated with constructing the assets, selling condominiums, marketing costs associated with our Strategic Developments, carrying costs including, but not limited to, property taxes and insurance and other ongoing costs relating to maintaining the assets in their current condition. If we decide to redevelop or develop a Strategic Developments asset, we would expect that with the exception of the residential portion of our condominium projects, upon completion of development, the asset would likely be reclassified to Operating Assets when the asset is placed in service and NOI would become a meaningful measure of its operating performance. All development costs discussed herein are exclusive of land costs.

-decrease in Equity in earnings (losses) from real estate and other affiliates primarily due to a $267.5 million gain on deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker attributable to the initial fair value step-up of the retained equity method investment at the time of deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2020. Please refer to Note 2 - Investments in Real Estate and Other Affiliates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.
-decrease in Other land, rental and property revenues primarily due to the recognition of $15.4 million of previously eliminated 110 North Wacker development fees upon deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2020
-increase in Provision of impairment of $13.1 million due to an impairment of Century Park in the second quarter of 2021. Century Park was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 4 - Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
-decrease in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net of $7.8 million driven by 2021 activity that included a loss of $7.4 million related to the sale of Century Park and a gain of $21.3 million related to the sale of Monarch City, compared to 2020 activity that included a gain of $13.7 million related to the sale of Elk Grove and the receipt of an $8.0 million termination payment related to the 2019 sale of West Windsor.
These decreases in EBT were partially offset by the following:
-increase in net condominium sales (condominium unit sales net of condominium cost of sales) of $121.4 million driven by the timing of condominium closings. The Company closed on 670 units during the year ended December 31, 2021, including 663 units at ‘A‘ali‘i which completed construction during the fourth quarter of 2021, 5 units at Waiea and the final 2 units at Anaha, compared to zero condominium units closed during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to significantly lower available inventory as no new condominium towers were scheduled for completion in 2020.
-decrease in Condominium right and unit cost of sales primarily driven by charges related to our expected funding of costs to correct alleged construction defects as Waiea. An additional $21.0 million was charged during the year ended December 31, 2021, related to additional anticipated costs, compared to charges of $99.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Strategic District segment EBT increased $76.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in Equity in earnings (losses) from real estate and other affiliates of $267.5 million due to a gain on deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker attributable to the initial fair value step-up of the retained equity method investment at the time of deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2020.
-increase in Other land, rental and property revenues primarily due to the recognition of $15.4 million of previously eliminated 110 North Wacker development fees upon deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2020.
These increases were partially offset by the following:
-increase in Condominium rights and unit cost of sales primarily driven by a $99.2 million charge in the first quarter of 2020, related to our expected funding of costs to correct alleged construction defects at Waiea.
-decrease in net condominium sales of $78.4 million driven by the timing of condominium closings. The Company closed on 596 units in 2019, primarily at Ke Kilohana and Ae’o, with zero closings and no new condominium towers scheduled for completion in 2020.
-increase in Condominium rights and unit cost of sales of $7.6 million driven by a reduction in the estimated net sales price of certain condominium units, including the remaining penthouse inventory, to better align the expected price with recently contracted final sales prices
-decrease in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net of $5.4 million as a result of 2020 activity that included the sale of Elk Grove and the receipt of a termination payment related to the 2019 sale of West Windsor, compared to 2019 activity related to the sales of Cottonwood Mall, West Windsor and Bridges at Mint Hill.

Strategic Developments Projects The following describes the status of our major construction projects and announced Strategic Developments projects as of December 31, 2021. For information on the construction financings on our projects, please refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District
We continued to execute on our redevelopment strategy in the Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District during 2021. The Master Plan and zoning for Downtown Columbia, as amended in 2017, allows for a total of approximately 14,000,000 square feet for all of Downtown Columbia and has densities for the future development of up to 6,200 residential units, 4,300,000 square feet of commercial office space, 1,300,000 square feet of retail space and 640 hotel rooms. The majority of the properties will be developed on raw land, surface parking lots and other assets controlled by us. Based on the Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement, signed in 2018 with the County, the existing Master Plan, zoning and project approval process cannot be amended for a period of 30 years. Additionally, pursuant to a 2010 development agreement, we have a preferred residential and office development covenant that provides us the right of first offer for new development densities of both residential and office space within the Columbia Mall Ring Road. This covenant expires in 2030.
We are currently focusing on the redevelopment of the Merriweather and Lakefront Districts. At the Merriweather District, we began construction on Marlow, a 472-unit multi-family property, in the first quarter of 2021. At the Lakefront District, we received final approvals in 2019 for approximately 2,000,000 square feet of net new mixed-use development which will include office, retail and residential assets. We expect to begin construction on South Lake Medical Office Building, an 86,000 square foot office property, in the first quarter of 2022. This future development district also includes four acres of land related to Ridgley Building, Sterret Place and American City Building, all of which have been demolished.
Marlow Marlow will be a 472-unit multi-family property comprised of studio, one, two and three-bedroom units and approximately 32,000 square feet of new street level retail space. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $130.5 million, which will be partially financed with a $82.6 million construction loan that closed in April 2021. We began construction in the first quarter of 2021 and anticipate project completion in the first quarter of 2023. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $9.3 million by 2026.
Bridgeland
Starling at Bridgeland Starling at Bridgeland is the second phase of multi-family development in Bridgeland. The project will be 358-unit, luxury development, situated on approximately 15.2 acres and will be comprised of one, two and three-bedroom units. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $60.6 million which will be partially financed with a $42.7 million construction loan that closed in April 2021. We began construction in the fourth quarter of 2020 and anticipate project completion in the second quarter of 2022. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $4.4 million by 2025.
Summerlin
1700 Pavilion 1700 Pavilion will be a 267,000 square foot office property. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $121.5 million which will be partially financed with a $75.0 million construction loan that closed in September 2021. We began construction in the second quarter of 2021 and anticipate project completion in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $8.4 million by 2025.
Tanager Echo Tanager Echo will be a 294 unit multi-family property located in Downtown Summerlin, comprised of studio, one and two-bedroom units. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $86.2 million which will be partially financed with a $59.5 million construction loan that closed in September 2021.

Ward Village
We continue to transform Ward Village into a vibrant neighborhood offering unique retail experiences, dining and entertainment, along with exceptional residences and workforce housing set among open public spaces and pedestrian-friendly streets. We believe we have found the optimal mix of price point and product in the Honolulu market for condominium development as evidenced by the demand for our condominium projects discussed below. The ongoing and completed construction at our mixed-use condominium projects includes 171,307 square feet of retail to serve our new residents and the community at large. In addition, during the last half of 2017, we removed 226,466 square feet of dated retail space from service to prepare it for redevelopment. Many of the tenants occupying these locations were relocated within Ward Village. As we progress the buildout of the master plan, which ultimately contemplates a total of approximately 1,000,000 million square feet of commercial space at completion, we will periodically redevelop, reposition, or replace the existing retail spaces as part of new mixed-use projects.
In 2021, Ward Village achieved the highest sales volume in the community’s history. We broke ground at Victoria Place, launched sales at the Park Ward Village and completed construction and began welcoming residents at ‘A‘ali‘i.
Condominium revenue is recognized when construction of the condominium tower is complete and unit sales close, leading to variability in revenue recognized between periods. We closed on 670 condominium units during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the completion and opening of ‘A‘ali‘i , compared to zero condominium units for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to significantly lower available inventory in completed towers during 2020.
Sales contracts for condominium units are subject to a 30-day rescission period, and the buyers are typically required to make an initial deposit at signing and an additional deposit 30 days later at which point their total deposit becomes non-refundable. Buyers are typically then required to make a final deposit within approximately 90 days of our receipt of their second deposit. Certain buyers are required to deposit the remainder of the sales price on a predetermined pre-closing date, which is specified in the sales contracts for each condominium project. Contracted amounts disclosed below represent sales that are past the 30-day rescission period.
Completed Condominiums As of December 31, 2021, our five completed towers are 96.2% sold with only 2 units remaining to be sold at Waiea and 78 units remaining to be sold at ‘A‘ali‘i. Ae‘o, Ke Kilohana and Anaha are completely sold.
Under Construction Condominiums As of December 31, 2021, 93.1% of the units at our two under construction towers, Kō'ula and Victoria Place, are under contract. We launched public sales of our sixth condominium project, Kō'ula, in January 2019 and broke ground in July 2019. Kō'ula will be a 41-story, 565-unit, mixed-use condominium project located on Auahi Street that consists of studio, one, two and three-bedroom residences. We expect to complete construction of Kō'ula in the third quarter of 2022 and anticipate closing on the sale of the 505 units under contract as of December 31, 2021 at that time. We launched public sales of our seventh condominium project, Victoria Place, in December 2019 and broke ground in February 2021. Victoria Place will be a 40-story, 349-unit condominium project located between Auahi Street and Ala Moana Boulevard that consists of one, two and three-bedroom residences. As of December 31, 2021, Victoria Place is 99.1% presold, with only 3 units remaining to be sold.
Predevelopment Condominiums We launched public sales of our eighth condominium project in July 2021. The Park Ward Village will be a 41-story, 545-unit condominium project located at Ward Avenue and Auahi Street, adjacent to Victoria Ward Park. The project consists of studio, one, two and three-bedroom residences with units ranging from approximately 400 square feet to 1,500 square feet. As of December 31, 2021, we have entered into contracts for 459 of the 545 units, representing 84.2% of total units. This strong sales activity continued after year end, and as of February 24, 2022, we have entered into contracts for 480 units, representing 88.1% of total units. The Park Ward Village is now Ward Village’s fastest-selling tower since inception, surpassing Victoria Place which held the previous record.
In 2021, HHC announced plans for our ninth condominium project, Ulana Ward Village. This mixed-use residence will be adjacent to the new Ka Laʻi o Kukuluāeʻo public park and will consist of 696 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units. All units are designated as workforce housing units and are being offered to local residents who meet certain maximum income and net worth requirements. In March 2022, the Company will advance the lottery for local residents and expects to have the first contracted sales in the second quarter of 2022.

The following table contains certain corporate related and other items not related to segment activities and that are not otherwise included within the segment analyses. Variances related to income and expenses included in NOI or EBT are explained within the previous segment discussions. Significant variances for consolidated items not included in NOI or EBT are described below for the years ended December 31.
For the year ended December 31, 2021:
Corporate income, expenses and other items was unfavorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-increase in loss on extinguishment of debt of $35.1 million due to the repurchase of the Company’s $1.0 billion 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025
-increase in corporate interest expense, net primarily due to the issuance of $750 million 5.375% Senior Notes in August 2020, as well as the issuance of $650 million 4.125% Senior Notes and $650 million 4.375% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by the repurchase of the $1.0 billion 5.375% Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2021
-increase in income tax expense primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the release of a valuation allowance on the Company’s capital loss carryover in 2021. Refer to Note 12 - Income Taxes for additional information.
Corporate income, expenses and other items was favorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily related to workforce reductions and other corporate initiatives, that have been completed in accordance with a corporate restructuring initiative that began in 2019 as part of an overall plan to reduce recurring overhead costs, and a decrease in consulting expenses as a result of fewer IT projects taking place in 2021
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Corporate income, expenses and other items was favorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-decrease in General and administrative expenses primarily related to the reduction of labor costs due to workforce reductions that have been completed in accordance with a corporate restructuring initiative that began in 2019 as part of an overall plan to reduce recurring overhead costs, and lower travel and entertainment costs, which are attributable to COVID-19 travel restrictions
-decrease in income tax expense primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes
-decrease in Development-related marketing costs primarily related to a reduction in the number of projects under development
Corporate income, expenses and other items was unfavorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-increase in corporate interest expense, net primarily due to the $750 million issuance of senior notes in August 2020, as well as a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates
-decrease in corporate other income (loss), net due to the receipt of Superstorm Sandy insurance proceeds in the second quarter of 2019, which did not recur in 2020

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate is typically impacted by non-deductible executive compensation and other permanent differences as well as state income taxes, which cause the Company’s effective tax rate to deviate from the federal statutory rate.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 23.6% compared to 137.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the following:
-a release of a valuation allowance of $4.7 million on the Company’s capital loss carryover in 2021 that was established in 2020 related to a capital loss generated by the sale of the Company’s 50% equity method investment in Circle T Ranch and Power Center in 2020 (refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details)
-a valuation allowance of $1.8 million on our charitable contribution carryover in 2020
-a tax expense of $1.7 million related to the recapture of federal and state historic preservation credits due to the sale of our interest in Mr. C Seaport in 2020 (refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details)
-offset by a $4.8 million tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interest share of the gain on the deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker in 2020 (refer to Note 2 - Investments in Real Estate and Other Affiliates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details)
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 137.4% compared to 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:
-a valuation allowance of $4.7 million on a capital loss generated by the sale of the Company’s 50% equity method investment in Circle T Ranch and Power Center in 2020
-a valuation allowance of $1.8 million on our charitable contribution carryover in 2020
-a tax expense of $1.7 million related to the recapture of federal and state historic preservation credits due to the sale of our interest in Mr. C Seaport in 2020
-offset by a $4.8 million tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interest share of the gain on the deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker in 2020
For additional information on income taxes, see Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Capitalized Internal Costs The following table presents our capitalized internal costs by segment for the years ended December 31:
Capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, primarily related to the timing of construction projects in the Strategic Developments, MPC and Seaport segments, as more development projects were approved and staffing was reallocated to support the development activity. As projects continue to begin construction, internal costs will continue to be capitalized within these segments.
Capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily related to workforce reductions in the Strategic Developments segment. The capitalized internal costs for the Seaport segment increased due to tenant buildouts and escalated work on the Tin Building. In the MPC segment, capitalized internal costs decreased in 2020 due to fluctuations in the level of development activity at our newer MPCs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Throughout the pandemic we have focused on measures to increase our liquidity. As a result, we have been able to maintain a strong balance sheet and ensure we maintain the financial flexibility and liquidity necessary to fund future growth. We continued to enhance our liquidity profile in 2021 through $2.1 billion of permanent financings, replacing $2.1 billion of existing debt, and closed on $628 million of construction financings to support development spending at our latest projects actively under construction. These financings extended the term of our maturities and took advantage of a historically low interest rate environment. Refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The strength of HHC’s balance sheet has allowed us to deploy significant amounts of capital in 2021 including our acquisition of Douglas Ranch, share buybacks, and the ability to continue unlocking value through the development of new projects across the portfolio.
During 2021, we continued to pursue the sale of our remaining non-core assets with the goal of generating an estimated $600.0 million of net proceeds after debt repayment. We closed on the sale of Monarch City during the second quarter of 2021 for net proceeds of $50.9 million, the sale of our hospitality properties in The Woodlands during the third quarter of 2021 for net proceeds after debt repayment of $119.7 million and the sale of Century Park during the fourth quarter of 2021 for net proceeds of $25.0 million. Since the fourth quarter of 2019, we have completed the sales of 13 non-core assets generating approximately $401.0 million of net proceeds after debt repayment.
In October 2021, the board of directors of The Howard Hughes Corporation, authorized a share repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, purchase up to $250.0 million of its common stock through open market transactions. The date and time of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The new program replaces the Company’s prior share repurchase program adopted in October 2019. Under the new program, during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company repurchased 1,023,284 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share for $96.6 million, or approximately $94.42 per share. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased an additional 1,579,646 shares of its common stock, for $153.4 million, or approximately $97.10 per share, thereby completing all authorized purchases under the plan. All purchases were funded with cash on hand.
Operating Activities Each segment’s relative contribution to our cash flows from operating activities will likely vary significantly from year to year given the changing nature of our development focus. Other than our condominium properties, most of the properties and projects in our Strategic Developments segment do not generate revenues and the cash flows and earnings may vary. Operating cash continued to be utilized in 2021 to fund ongoing development expenditures in our Strategic Developments, Seaport and MPC segments, consistent with prior years.
The cash flows and earnings from the MPC business may fluctuate more than from our operating assets because the MPC business generates revenues from land sales rather than recurring contractual revenues from operating leases. MPC land sales are a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities and are partially offset by development costs associated with the land sales business and acquisitions of land that is intended to ultimately be developed and sold.
Net cash used in operating activities increased $211.1 million in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase in MPC land acquisitions primarily related to Douglas Ranch and Trillium, an increase in Condominium development expenditures and an increase in MPC development expenditures. These increases in cash used were partially offset by an increase in cash provided from condominium rights and units sales as a result of closings at ‘A‘ali‘i and an increase in MPC land sales.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $280.6 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in condominium rights and units sales due to timing of closings, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of lease receivable and condominium deposits received.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by investing activities of $101.5 million was primarily related to proceeds from sales of our hospitality properties in the Woodlands, Monarch City and Century Park of $322.5 million and distributions from real estate and affiliates of $92.1 million, primarily related to The Summit. These cash inflows were offset by property development expenditures primarily related to ongoing development at The Seaport, 1700 Pavilion, Marlow and Tanager Echo.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities of $428.5 million was primarily related to property development expenditures related to ongoing development activity at 110 North Wacker, the Seaport and 6100 Merriweather.
Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2021, net proceeds from new loan borrowings and refinancing activities exceeded principal payments on our debt by $282.5 million and were used to partially fund development activity at our development projects, to increase liquidity and for the acquisition of assets. Under the new share repurchase program, during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company repurchased 1,023,284 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for $96.6 million, or approximately $94.42 per share. Due to the timing of share repurchase payments, $15.5 million was recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased an additional 1,579,646 shares of its common stock, for $153.4 million, or approximately $97.10 per share, thereby completing all authorized purchases under the plan. All purchases were funded with cash on hand.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds from new loan borrowings and refinancing activities exceeded principal payments on our debt by $536.0 million and were used to partially fund development activity at our development projects, to increase liquidity and for the acquisition of assets. Cash provided by financing activities also included $593.6 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
Short-Term Liquidity In the next twelve months, we expect our primary sources of cash to include cash flow from condominium closings, MPC land sales, cash generated from our Operating assets, first mortgage financings secured by our assets and deposits from condominium sales (which are restricted to funding construction of the related developments). The sale of our non-core assets may also provide additional cash proceeds to our operating or investing activities. We expect our primary uses of cash to include condominium pre-development and development costs, debt principal payments and debt service costs, MPC land development costs and other capital expenditures. We believe that our sources of cash, including existing cash on hand, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next 12 months.
Long-Term Liquidity The development and redevelopment opportunities in Strategic Developments, Seaport and Operating Assets are capital intensive and will require significant additional funding, if and when pursued. Any additional funding would be raised with a mix of construction, bridge and long-term financings, by entering into joint venture arrangements, through the sale of non-core assets at the appropriate time, and lastly future equity raises.
We cannot provide assurance that financing arrangements for our properties will be on favorable terms or occur at all, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, we typically must provide completion guarantees to lenders in connection with their providing financing for our projects. We also provided completion guarantees to the City of New York for the redevelopment of the Tin Building, as well as the Hawai‘i Community Development Authority for reserve condominium units at Ward Village.

Summary of Remaining Development Costs The following table summarizes remaining development costs related to projects under construction and related debt held in Operating Assets, Seaport and Strategic Developments segments as of December 31, 2021. Total cost remaining to be paid net of debt and buyer deposits consists of $195.6 million related to substantially completed projects, $76.5 million related to projects with estimated completion dates within the next 12 months and $11.2 million related to projects with estimated completion dates in 2023 and 2024.
Projects that are substantially complete and which have been placed into service in the Operating Assets or Seaport segments are included in the following table if the project has more than $1.0 million of estimated costs remaining to be incurred. As of December 31, 2021, $117.6 million of the cost related to substantially completed projects primarily relates to warranty repairs at Waiea in Ward Village. However, we anticipate recovering a substantial amount of these costs in the future, which is not reflected in the table below. The remaining cost related to substantially completed projects primarily represents budgeted tenant allowances necessary to bring the asset to stabilized occupancy.
We expect to be able to meet our cash funding requirements with a combination of existing and anticipated construction loans, condominium buyer deposits, free cash flow from our Operating Assets and MPC segments, net proceeds from condominium sales and our existing cash balances.
(a)With respect to our condominium projects, remaining debt to be drawn is reduced by deposits utilized for construction. Refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on each loan.
(b)Estimated remaining to be spent includes amounts for Waiea warranty repairs. However, we anticipate recovering a substantial amount of these costs in the future, which is not reflected in this schedule.

(b)Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and current floating interest rates.
We lease land or buildings at certain properties from third parties. Rental payments are expensed as incurred and have been, to the extent applicable, straight-lined over the term of the lease. Contractual rental expense, including participation rent, was $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The amortization of above- and below-market ground leases and straight-line rents included in the contractual rent amount were not significant.
Debt Total outstanding debt was $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. Certain mortgages may require paydowns in order to exercise contractual extension terms. Please refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a table showing our debt maturity dates.
Debt Compliance Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced a decline in operating results for certain retail and hospitality properties resulting in the Company not meeting its required debt service coverage ratio for the $615.0 million Term Loan portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020. As a result, the excess net cash flow after debt service from the underlying properties became restricted. While the restricted cash could not be used for general corporate purposes, it could be used to fund operations of the underlying assets and did not have a material impact on the Company’s liquidity. As a result of payments on the Term Loan, the Company met the debt service coverage ratio as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021. As two consecutive quarters of compliance were required to release the restricted cash requirement, $43.0 million of restricted cash as of December 31, 2021, qualifies for release.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not meet the debt service coverage ratio for the Two Hughes Landing loan. As a result, the excess net cash flow after debt service from the underlying property became restricted and cannot be used for general corporate purposes, but can continue to be used to fund operations of the underlying asset. This restriction does not have a material impact on the Company’s liquidity.
As of December 31, 2021, apart from the Two Hughes Landing loan described above, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants included in the agreements governing its indebtedness.
Net Debt The following table summarizes our net debt on a segment basis as of December 31, 2021. Net debt is defined as Mortgages, notes and loans payable, net, including our ownership share of debt of our Real estate and other affiliates, reduced by liquidity sources to satisfy such obligations such as our ownership share of Cash and cash equivalents and SID, MUD and TIF receivables. Although net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure, we believe that such information is useful to our investors and other users of our financial statements as net debt and its components are important indicators of our overall liquidity, capital structure and financial position. However, it should not be used as an alternative to our debt calculated in accordance with GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make informed judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the accounting policies below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand and evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations.
Methodology We review our long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Although the carrying amount may exceed the estimated fair value of certain properties, a real estate asset is only considered to be impaired when its carrying amount is not expected to be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To the extent an impairment provision is necessary, the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is expensed to operations and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced. The adjusted carrying amount, which represents the new cost basis of the asset, is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset or, for MPCs, is expensed as a cost of sales when land is sold.
Judgments and uncertainties An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The cash flow estimates used both for determining recoverability and estimating fair value are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected trends in rental, occupancy, pricing, development costs, sales pace and capitalization rates, selling costs, and estimated holding periods for the applicable assets. As such, the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Unfavorable changes in any of the primary assumptions could result in a reduction of anticipated future cash flows and could indicate property impairment. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions could affect the timing of an impairment. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
Methodology When residential or commercial land is sold, the cost of sales includes actual costs incurred and estimates of future development costs benefiting the property sold. When land is sold, costs are allocated to each sold superpad or lot based upon the relative sales value. For purposes of allocating development costs, estimates of future revenues and development costs are re-evaluated throughout the year, with adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining parcels available for sale. For certain parcels of land, including acquired parcels that the Company does not intend to develop or for which development was complete at the date of acquisition, the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of sales.
Judgments and uncertainties MPC cost of sales estimates are highly judgmental as they are sensitive to cost escalation, sales price escalation and pace of absorption, which are subject to judgment and affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate future development costs could result in a significant impact on the amounts recorded as cost of sales.
