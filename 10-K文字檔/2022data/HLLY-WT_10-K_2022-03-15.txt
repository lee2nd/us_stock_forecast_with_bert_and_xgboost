Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Holley,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” in this section are to the business and operations of Holley Inc. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Holley’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause Holley’s actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed herein and under the caption, “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a designer, marketer, and manufacturer of high performance automotive aftermarket products serving car and truck enthusiasts, with sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States, Canada, Europe and China. Holley designs, markets, manufactures and distributes a diversified line of performance automotive products including fuel injection systems, tuners, exhaust products, carburetors, safety equipment and various other performance automotive products. The Company’s products are designed to enhance street, off-road, recreational and competitive vehicle performance and safety.
Innovation is at the core of our business and growth strategy with approximately 35% of our 2021 sales coming from products introduced by us into the market since 2016. We have a history of developing innovative products, including new products in existing product families, product line expansions, and accessories, as well as products that bring us into new categories. We have thoughtfully expanded our product portfolio over time to adapt to consumer needs.
In addition, we have historically used strategic acquisitions to (i) expand our brand portfolio, (ii) enter new product categories and consumer segments, (iii) increase direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) scale and connection, (iv) expand share in current product categories and (v) realize value-enhancing revenue and cost synergies. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that would complement our current business and expand our addressable target market.
Factors Affecting our Performance
We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section of this Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors.”
Business Combination
On July 16, 2021 we consummated a business combination (“Business Combination”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Empower Ltd., (“Empower”), Empower Merger Sub I Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower (“Merger Sub I”), Empower Merger Sub II LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower (“Merger Sub II”), and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").
The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, the following transactions: (i) Merger Sub I merged with and into Holdings, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I ceased and Holdings became the surviving corporation, and (ii) Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub II, the separate corporate existence of Holdings ceased and Merger Sub II became the surviving limited liability company. Upon closing, Empower changed its name to Holley Inc. and its trading symbol on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) from “EMPW” to “HLLY.”
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Holdings was deemed the accounting acquirer with Holley Inc. as the successor registrant. As such, Empower was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes, and financial statements for periods prior to the Business Combination are those of Holdings.
As a result of the Business Combination, Holley Inc. listed on the NYSE, which required us to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, and additional internal and external accounting, legal, and administrative resources, including increased personnel costs, audit and other professional service fees.
Acquisitions
Holley has historically pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. The Company has pursued acquisitions that it believes will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. Holley targets companies that are market leaders, expand the Company’s geographic presence, provide a highly synergistic opportunity and/or enhance Holley’s ability to provide a wide array of its products to its customers through its distribution network.
From 2019 through 2021, we completed 12 acquisitions. The most significant of these acquisitions impacting the comparability of our operating results were:
•AEM Performance Electronics: On April 14, 2021 Holley acquired AEM Performance Electronics (“AEM”), a developer and supplier of electronic control and monitoring systems for performance automotive applications. This acquisition increases Holley’s penetration into the import and other sport compact cars submarket.
•Drake Automotive Group: On November 11, 2020 Holley acquired Drake Automotive Group LLC (“Drake”), a designer and seller of automotive aftermarket appearance parts, wheels, chassis & suspension products and accessories. This acquisition increases Holley’s penetration within the Ford/Mustang platform where it has historically been under indexed relative to the market.
•Simpson Performance Products: On November 16, 2020 Holley acquired Simpson Performance Products, Inc. (“Simpson”), a designer and seller of motorsport safety products including helmets head & neck restraints, seat belts, firesuits and more. This acquisition extended Holley’s footprint into the safety and racing segment.
The acquisitions have all been accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and the operations of the acquired entities are included in our historical results for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. See Note 1, “Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 2, “Business Combination and Acquisitions,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company’s acquisitions and investments.
COVID-19 Outbreak
COVID-19 has adversely impacted global supply chain and general economic conditions. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. In 2021 we continued to generate strong demand for our products; however, we have experienced and may continue to experience global supply constraints which affected our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and incremental costs from labor and material inflation, and expediting costs resulting from current-period supply chain shortages. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business and operational and financial performance and condition is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company's control, including but not limited to the timing, extent, duration and effects of the virus and any of its mutations, the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, the imposition of effective public safety and other protective measures, the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants such as Delta and Omicron, not improve or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate its impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.
Key Components of Results of Operations
Net Sales
The principal activity from which the Company generates its sales is the designing, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of performance aftermarket automotive parts for its end consumers. Sales are displayed net of rebates and sales returns allowances. Sales returns are recorded as a charge against gross sales in the period in which the related sales are recognized.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of purchased parts and manufactured products, including materials and direct labor costs. In addition, warranty, incoming shipping and handling and inspection and repair costs are also included within costs of goods sold. Reductions in the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are also a component of cost of goods sold.
Selling, General, and Administrative
Selling, general, and administrative consist of payroll and related personnel expenses, IT and office services, office rent expense and professional services. In addition, self-insurance, advertising, research and development, outgoing shipping costs, pre-production and start-up costs are also included within selling, general, and administrative. The Company expects to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as higher expenses for general and director and officer insurance, investor relations and other professional services.
Acquisition and Restructuring Costs
Acquisition and restructuring costs consist of professional fees for legal, accounting, consulting, administrative, and other professional services directly attributable to potential acquisitions. In addition, operational restructuring costs are included within this classification.
Related Party Acquisition and Management Fee Costs
Related party acquisition and management fee costs consist of fees paid to the Company’s historical private equity sponsor pursuant to a management services agreement for management services and consulting services directly attributable to potential acquisitions. Upon the Closing of the Business Combination, the management services agreement with our private equity sponsor was terminated.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of interest due on the indebtedness under our credit facilities. On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into a new credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender (the "Credit Agreement"). The financing consists of a seven-year $600 million first-lien term loan, a five-year $125 million revolving credit facility, and a $100 million delayed draw term loan. As of December 31, 2021, $655.0 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Interest is based on LIBOR or the prime rate, plus the applicable margin rate.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2020
The table below presents Holley’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $188.6 million, or 37.4%, to $692.8 million compared to $504.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Non-comparable sales associated with acquisitions contributed $116.4 million or 23.1% of year-over-year growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by a $37.3 million, or 25.1%, increase in electronic systems products sold and a $18.4 million, or 18.1%, increase in mechanical systems products sold.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for year ended December 31, 2021 increased $110.1 million, or 37.2%, to $406.0 million compared to $295.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2021 was in line with a corresponding increase in product sales during such period.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $78.5 million, or 37.7%, to $286.8 million compared to $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross profit was driven by the increase in sales. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 41.4% compared to a gross margin of 41.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $45.9 million, or 64.8%, to $116.8 million compared to $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. When expressed as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative costs increased to 16.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 14.1% of sales in 2020. Recent acquisitions accounted for $18.5 million of the increase in selling, general and administrative costs. The increase in costs was also driven by a $4.5 million increase in compensation expense related to equity awards, a $5.4 million increase in outbound shipping costs related to higher sales and domestic supply chain pressure, and a $5.9 million increase in professional fees, primarily due to the Business Combination and as a result of becoming a public company.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $4.8 million, or 20.4%, to $28.3 million compared to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to headcount investments as we continue to pursue product innovation and new products.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $2.9 million, or 26.3%, to $14.0 million compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to recent acquisitions.
Acquisition and Restructuring Costs
Acquisition and restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $14.0 million to $23.7 million, which includes $17.2 million in contingent consideration related to the Simpson acquisition, $4.8 million in professional fees associated with the eight acquisitions completed in 2021, and $1.4 million of restructuring costs related to recent acquisitions. Acquisition and restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $9.7 million, which includes $2.3 million in professional fees associated with the Simpson, Drake and Detroit Speed acquisitions completed in 2020 and $3.2 million in restructuring costs incurred with the move of the West Sacramento, CA operations to our Bowling Green, KY facilities.
Related Party Acquisition and Management Fees
Related party acquisition and management fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $25.8 million, of which $23.3 million represents a fee paid upon the Closing of the Business Combination. Related party acquisition and management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $6.1 million, which includes $4.2 million in management fees paid to the Company’s former private equity sponsor and $1.9 million that was attributable to the Drake and Simpson acquisitions,
Operating Income
As a result of factors described above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $8.0 million, or 9.3%, to $77.5 million compared to $85.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
For the year ended December 31, 2021 we recognized a loss of $32.6 million from the change in fair value of the warrant liability. The warrant liability reflects the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the Business Combination.
Change in Fair Value of Earn-Out Liability
For the year ended December 31, 2021 we recognized a loss of $8.9 million from the change in fair value of the earn-out liability. The earn-out liability reflects the fair value of the earn-out shares resulting from the Business Combination.
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt
For the year ended December 31, 2021 we recognized a $13.6 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt. The extinguishment loss includes a write off of $12.2 million in unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our previous first lien and second lien notes due to the refinancing of our previous credit facility (refer to Note 6 - Debt for further discussion). Additionally, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs when $100 million of the net proceeds from the Business Combination were used to reduce the outstanding principal balance of our second lien note.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 4.7 million, or 10.6%, to $39.1 million compared to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a lower effective interest rate combine with the favorable impact of the $100 million paydown on our second lien note in July 2021.
Income (Loss) before Income Taxes
As a result of factors described above, we recognized a loss of $(16.7) million before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income before income taxes of $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income Tax Expense
We recognized income tax expense of $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized tax expense on a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to permanent differences resulting from the Business Combination, change in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities, and the adjustment to the Simpson earnout during the period.
Net Income (Loss) and Total Comprehensive Income (Loss)
As a result of factors described above, we recognized a net loss of $(27.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we recognized total comprehensive loss of $(26.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to total comprehensive income of $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Comprehensive income (loss) includes the effect of foreign currency translation and pension liability adjustments.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019
The table below presents Holley’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $135.5 million, or 36.8%, to $504.2 million compared to $368.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net sales during 2020 was primarily due to a $33.5 million, or 64.3%, increase in EFI products sold, a $20.1 million, or 38.8%, increase in exhaust products sold and a $16.3 million, or 31.4%, increase in ignition products sold. These product lines increased as we continued to see growth in new product introductions.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $76.0 million, or 34.6%, to $295.9 million compared to $219.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 was in line with a corresponding increase in product sales during such period.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $59.5 million, or 40.0%, to $208.3 million compared to $148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit was driven by the increase in sales. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 41.3% compared to a gross margin of 40.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher gross margin was primarily due to increased fixed cost leverage from increased sales and integration activities.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $8.5 million, or 13.6%, to $70.9 million compared to $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. When expressed as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative costs decreased to 14.1% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 16.9% of sales in 2019. The increase in costs was driven by a $3.6 million increase in shipping and handling costs related to higher sales and a $2.4 million increase in costs associated with the significant growth in our DTC business as we focused our efforts in growing this business.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.9 million, or 13.8%, to $23.5 million compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development costs were primarily due to headcount investments of $2.3 million as we continue to pursue product innovation and new products.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $0.6 million, or 6.0%, to $11.1 million compared to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the full-year amortization of the Range Technologies Inc. acquisition intangible assets.
Acquisition and Restructuring Costs
Acquisition and restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $4.8 million, or 97.1%, to $9.7 million compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to $2.3 million in professional fees associated with the Simpson, Drake and Detroit Speed acquisitions completed in 2020 and $3.2 million in restructuring costs incurred with the move of the West Sacramento, CA operations to Bowling Green, KY facilities.
Related Party Acquisition and Management Fees
Related party acquisition and management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.4 million, or 66.3%, to $6.1 million compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in costs was due to one-time costs associated with acquisition, integration and restructuring activities. The acquisition costs were primarily attributable to the Drake and Simpson acquisitions.
Operating Income
As a result of factors described above, our operating income increased $39.4 million, or 85.5%, to $85.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $(6.6) million, or (13.1%), to $43.8 million compared to $50.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower outstanding debt for much of 2020 and lower interest rates.
Income (Loss) before Income Taxes
As a result of factors described above, we recognized income before income taxes of $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss before income taxes of $(4.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense was $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an income tax benefit of $(4.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax expense was due to an increase in income from the growth in sales. The effective tax rates were 21.2% and 113.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net Income and Total Comprehensive Income
As a result of factors described above, net income increased $32.4 million to $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, total comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $32.2 million to $32.6 million compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Comprehensive income includes the effect of foreign currency translation and pension liability adjustments.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Holley believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. In addition, Holley uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business. Holley believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help to depict a more realistic representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Holley believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results.
Holley defines EBITDA as earnings before (a) interest expense, (b) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. Holley defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) notable items that in 2021 consist primarily of the amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory and in 2020 consist primarily of the amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory and a legal settlement, (ii) compensation expense related to equity awards (iii) acquisition and restructuring costs, which for 2021 includes a $17.2 million adjustment due to a change in the fair value of the Simpson acquisition contingent consideration payable, (iv) changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, (v) changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability, (vi) losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (vii) related party acquisition and management fee costs, and (viii) other expenses, which includes losses from disposal of fixed assets and foreign currency transactions. We have included within the definition of Adjusted EBITDA the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability and losses from the early extinguishment of debt, as management believes such matters, when they occur, do not directly reflect the performance of the underlying business.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing Holley’s financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Holley’s primary cash needs are to support working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt repayments. The Company has generally financed its historical needs with operating cash flows, capital contributions and borrowings under its credit facilities. These sources of liquidity may be impacted by various factors, including demand for Holley’s products, investments made in acquired businesses, plant and equipment and other capital expenditures, and expenditures on general infrastructure and information technology.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash of $36.3 million and availability of $98.8 million under its revolving credit facility. The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with $125 million in borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2021, $25 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The Company also had $1.2 million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2021.
The Company is obligated under various operating leases for facilities, equipment and automobiles with estimated lease payments of approximately $8.5 million in fiscal year 2022. See Note 14, "Lease Commitments" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company’s lease obligations.
Holley's capital expenditures are primarily related to ongoing maintenance and improvements, including investments related to upgrading and maintaining our information technology systems, tooling for new products, vehicles for product development, and machinery and equipment for operations. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $14 million to $16 million in fiscal year 2022.
See Note 6, "Debt" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further detail of our credit facility and the timing of principal maturities. As of December 31, 2021, based on the then current weighted average interest rate of 4.5%, expected interest payments associated with outstanding debt totaled approximately $30 million for fiscal year 2022.
The Company believes that its cash on hand, cash from operations and borrowings available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates, judgements and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that the assumptions, judgements and estimates associated with the following have the greatest potential impact on, and are critical to the understanding of, our results of operations: inventory reserve and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the Business Combination and acquisitions. For further information see Note 1, “Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Inventory Reserve
The Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. See Part IV, Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's inventory valuation reserve.
We regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and on order and record write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on our estimate of the demand for our products, potential obsolescence of technology, product life cycles, and when
pricing trends or forecast indicate that the carrying value of inventory exceeds our estimated selling price. These factors are affected by market and economic conditions, technology changes, and new product introductions and require estimates that may include elements that are uncertain. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and may have a material effect on our gross margin. If inventory is written down, a new cost basis will be established that cannot be increased in future periods.
Fair Value of Acquired Assets and Liabilities
Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. The same applies to assigning fair market values to the liabilities assumed in the Business Combination at the date of the transaction and at each reporting date thereafter. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for certain acquisitions the Company retains the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets, tangible long-lived assets, and liabilities assumed in the Business Combination. Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued using various methodologies including discounted cash flows, relief from royalty, and multiperiod excess earnings depending on the type of intangible asset purchased. These methodologies incorporate various estimates and assumptions, such as projected revenue growth rates, profit margins and forecasted cash flows based on discount rates and terminal growth rates. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of its private warrants and earn-out liability assumed in the Business Combination, which requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including expected common stock price volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates. These estimates and assumptions could vary significantly, which could result in material differences in the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities. See Note 2, "Business Combination and Acquisitions" and Note 8, "Fair Value Measurements" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
