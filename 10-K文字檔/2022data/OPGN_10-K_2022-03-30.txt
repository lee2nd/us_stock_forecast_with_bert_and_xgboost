Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many important factors, including those set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Overview
OpGen is a precision medicine company harnessing the power of molecular diagnostics and informatics to help combat infectious disease. Along with our subsidiaries, Curetis GmbH and Ares Genetics GmbH, we are developing and commercializing molecular microbiology solutions helping to guide clinicians with more rapid and actionable information about life threatening infections to improve patient outcomes and decrease the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, or MDROs. Our current product portfolio includes Unyvero, Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, and the ARES Technology Platform including ARESdb, using NGS technology and AI-powered bioinformatics solutions for antibiotic response prediction, as well as the Curetis CE-IVD-marked PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit. The Company exited its FISH business in early 2021, and the Company's license agreement with Life Technologies, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher, was terminated as of June 30, 2021.
On April 1, 2020, the Company completed a business combination transaction whereby the Company acquired Curetis GmbH, a private limited liability company organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany (“Curetis GmbH”). Curetis is an early commercial-stage molecular diagnostics (MDx) company focused on rapid infectious disease testing for hospitalized patients with the aim to improve the treatment of hospitalized, critically ill patients with suspected microbial infection and has developed the innovative Unyvero molecular diagnostic solution for comprehensive infectious disease testing. The business combination transaction was designed principally to leverage each company’s existing research and development and relationships with hospitals and clinical laboratories to accelerate the sales of both companies’ products and services.
The focus of OpGen is on its combined broad portfolio of products, which includes high impact rapid diagnostics and bioinformatics to interpret AMR genetic data. The Company currently expects to focus on the following products for lower respiratory infection, urinary tract infection and invasive joint infection:
· The Unyvero Lower Respiratory Tract, or LRT, test (e.g. for bacterial pneumonias) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared test that can be used for the detection of more than 90% of common causative agents of hospitalized pneumonia. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (2018), pneumonia is a leading cause of admissions to the hospital and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The Unyvero LRT automated test detects 19 pathogens within less than five hours, with approximately two minutes of hands-on time and provides clinicians with a comprehensive overview of 10 genetic antibiotic resistance markers. We have commercialized the Unyvero LRT BAL test for testing bronchoalveolar lavage, or BAL, specimens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections following FDA clearance received by Curetis in December 2019. The Unyvero LRT BAL automated test simultaneously detects 20 pathogens and 10 antibiotic resistance markers, and it is the first and only FDA-cleared panel that also includes Pneumocystis jirovecii, a key fungal pathogen often found in immunocompromised patients (such as AIDS and transplant patients) that can be difficult to diagnose, as the 20th pathogen on the panel. We believe the Unyvero LRT and LRT BAL tests have the ability to help address a significant, previously unmet medical need that causes over $10 billion in annual costs for the U.S. healthcare system, according to the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC.
· Following registration of the Unyvero instrument system as an IVD for the Chinese market in early 2021, we are supporting our strategic partner BCB in pursuing execution of a supplemental clinical trial with the Unyvero HPN test. As requested by the Chinese regulatory authority NMPA, this study is geared towards generating additional data in China that will complement a larger data set with data from abroad compiled from other clinical and analytical studies performed in the past.
· The Unyvero Urinary Tract Infection, or UTI, test, which is CE-IVD marked in Europe, is currently being made available to laboratories in the United States as a research use only or RUO kit. The test detects a broad range of pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistance markers directly from native urine specimens. We initiated a prospective multi-center clinical trial for the Unyvero UTI in the United States in the third quarter of 2021.
· The Unyvero Invasive Joint Infection, or IJI, test, which is a variant being developed for the U.S. market, has also been selected for analytical and clinical performance evaluation including clinical trials towards a future U.S. FDA submission. Microbial diagnosis of IJI is difficult because of challenges in sample collection, usually at surgery, and patients being on prior antibiotic therapy which minimizes the chances of recovering viable bacteria. We believe that Unyvero IJI could be useful in identifying pathogens as well as their AMR markers to help guide optimal antibiotic treatment for these patients.
· On September 30, 2021, we received clearance from the FDA for our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for bacterial isolates. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel detects 28 genetic antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, markers in isolated bacterial colonies from 26 different pathogens. We believe the panel provides clinicians with a valuable diagnostic tool that informs about potential antimicrobial resistance patterns early and supports appropriate antibiotic treatment decisions in this indication. We expect to commercialize the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for isolates more broadly to customers in the United States.
· We are also developing novel bioinformatics tools and solutions to accompany or augment our current and potential future IVD products and may seek regulatory clearance for such bioinformatics tools and solutions to the extent they would be required either as part of our portfolio of IVD products or even as a standalone bioinformatics product.
OpGen has extensive offerings of additional IVD tests including CE-IVD-marked Unyvero tests for hospitalized pneumonia patients, implant and tissue infections, intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and blood stream infections. Our portfolio furthermore includes a CE-IVD-marked PCR based rapid test kit for SARS-CoV-2 detection in combination with our PCR compatible universal lysis buffer (PULB).
OpGen’s combined AMR bioinformatics offerings, when and if such products are cleared for marketing, will offer important new tools to clinicians treating patients with AMR infections. OpGen’s subsidiary Ares Genetics’ ARESdb is a comprehensive database of genetic and phenotypic information. ARESdb was originally designed based on the Siemens microbiology strain collection covering resistant pathogens and its development has significantly expanded, also by transferring data from the discontinued Acuitas Lighthouse into ARESdb to now cover > 78,000 bacterial isolates that have been sequenced using NGS technology and tested for susceptibility with applicable antibiotics from a range of over 100 antimicrobial drugs. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Ares Genetics entered into a strategic database access deal with one of the world’s leading microbiology and IVD corporations for their non-exclusive access to approximately 1.1% of Ares Genetics’ total database asset at the time of signing. Ares Genetics continues to explore various discussions with several interested parties in potential future collaboration or licensing opportunities. Additional partnerships with a U.S. CLIA lab, CRO and a major University Medical Center have been initiated and are ongoing and the collaboration master service agreement with Sandoz has recently been extended until January 2025.
In addition to potential future licensing and partnering, Ares Genetics intends to independently utilize the proprietary biomarker content in this database, as well as to build an independent business in NGS and AI based offerings for AMR research and diagnostics in collaboration with its current and potential future partners in the life science, pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries. Ares Genetics signed up Siemens Technology Accelerator and AGES (Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety), as well as several other national institutions from various European countries as new customers.
OpGen’s subsidiary Curetis’ Unyvero A50 tests for up to 130 diagnostic targets (pathogens and resistance genes) in under five hours with approximately two minutes of hands-on time. The system was first CE-IVD-marked in 2012 and was FDA cleared in 2018 along with the LRT test through a De Novo request. The Unyvero A30 RQ is a new device designed to address the low-to mid-plex testing market for 5-30 DNA targets and to provide results in approximately 30 to 90 minutes with 2-5 minutes of hands-on time. The Unyvero A30 RQ has a small benchtop footprint and has an attractive cost of goods profile. Curetis has been following a partnering strategy for the Unyvero A30 RQ and, following the successful completion of a key development milestone, Curetis has completed final verification and validation testing of the A30 instruments and is actively engaged in several ongoing partnering discussions and due diligence under respective material transfer agreements.
The Company has extensive partner and distribution relationships to help accelerate the establishment of a global infectious disease diagnostic testing and informatics business. The Company’s partners include A. Menarini Diagnostics S.r.l. for pan-European distribution to currently 12 countries and Beijing Clear Biotech Co. Ltd. for Unyvero A50 product distribution in China. We have a network of distributors covering countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. With the discontinuation of our FISH products business in Europe, we have reduced our network of distributors to only those distributors actively commercializing our Unyvero line of products or CE-IVD-marked SARS-CoV-2 test kits.
OpGen will continue to develop and seek FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals, as applicable, for our Unyvero UTI and IJI products. OpGen will continue to offer the FDA-cleared Unyvero LRT and LRT BAL Panels, and FDA-cleared Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests, as well as the Unyvero UTI Panel as a RUO product to hospitals, public health departments, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical companies and CROs. OpGen’s subsidiary, Curetis, continues its preparations for achieving compliance with the upcoming European Union’s In-Vitro-Diagnostic Device Regulation (IVDR), which officially will go into effect in May 2022. Given the lack of designated Notified Bodies at this time, and with the recently approved EU commission proposal to provide for generous multi-year grace periods for IVD products with current In-Vitro-Diagnostic Device Directive (IVDD) CE marking, it is now possible for Curetis to continue its portfolio of existing CE-IVD marked products until at least May 2025 and May 2026, respectively, as long as no material changes are being made to any of its products. Following May 2022, however, any new or changed CE marked products will be required to be IVDR compliant from the outset.
Our headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and our principal operations are in Rockville, Maryland and Holzgerlingen and Bodelshausen, both in Germany. We also have operations in Vienna, Austria. We operate in one business segment.
Financing Transactions
Since inception, the Company has incurred, and continues to incur, significant losses from operations. The Company has funded its operations primarily through external investor financing arrangements. The following financing transactions took place during 2020 and 2021:
· On February 11, 2020, the Company entered into an at-the-market sales agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., which was subsequently amended and restated on November 13, 2020, to add BTIG as a sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell from time to time in an “at the market offering,” at its option, up to an aggregate of $22.1 million of shares of its common stock through the sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold 7,521,610 shares of its common stock under the ATM Offering resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $15.8 million, and gross proceeds of $16.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold 680,000 shares of its common stock under the ATM Offering resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.48 million, and gross proceeds of $1.55 million.
· On November 25, 2020, the Company closed a private placement with one healthcare-focused U.S. institutional investor of (i) 2,245,400 shares of common stock together with 2,245,400 warrants (the “Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,245,400 shares of common stock and (ii) 2,597,215 pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), with each Pre-Funded Warrant exercisable for one share of common stock, together with 2,597,215 Common Warrants to purchase up to 2,597,215 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock and accompanying Common Warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of $2.065, and each Pre-funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of $2.055. The Common Warrants have an exercise price of $1.94 per share and are exercisable commencing on the six month anniversary of the date of issuance, and will expire five and one half (5.5) years from the date of issuance (collectively, the “2020 PIPE”). The 2020 PIPE raised aggregate net proceeds of $9.3 million, and gross proceeds of $10.0 million.
· During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 4.3 million common warrants issued in a public offering that we consummated in October 2019 were exercised, raising net proceeds of approximately $8.7 million.
· On February 11, 2021, the Company closed a registered direct offering (the "February 2021 Offering”) with a single U.S.-based, healthcare-focused institutional investor for the purchase of (i) 2,784,184 shares of common stock and (ii) 5,549,149 pre-funded warrants, with each pre-funded warrant exercisable for one share of common stock. The Company also issued to the investor, in a concurrent private placement, unregistered common share purchase warrants to purchase 4,166,666 shares of the Company’s common stock. Each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of $3.00, and each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of $2.99. The pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable, at an exercise price of $0.01, and could be exercised at any time until all of the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. The common warrants have an exercise price of $3.55 per share, are exercisable commencing on the six-month anniversary of the date of issuance, and will expire five and one-half (5.5) years from the date of issuance. The February 2021 Offering raised aggregate net proceeds of $23.5 million, and gross proceeds of $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, all 5,549,149 pre-funded warrants issued in the February 2021 Offering have been exercised.
· On March 9, 2021, the Company entered into a Warrant Exercise Agreement (the “Exercise Agreement”) with the institutional investor (the “Holder”) from our 2020 PIPE. Pursuant to the Exercise Agreement, in order to induce the Holder to exercise all of the remaining 4,842,615 outstanding warrants acquired in the 2020 PIPE (the “Existing Warrants”) for cash, pursuant to the terms of and subject to beneficial ownership limitations contained in the Existing Warrants, the Company agreed to issue to the Holder new warrants (the “New Warrants”) to purchase 0.65 shares of common stock for each share of common stock issued upon such exercise of the Existing Warrants pursuant to the Exercise Agreement for an aggregate of 3,147,700 New Warrants. The terms of the New Warrants are substantially similar to those of the Existing Warrants, except that the New Warrants have an exercise price of $3.56. The New Warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire five years from the date of the Exercise Agreement. The Holder paid an aggregate of $255,751 to the Company for the purchase of the New Warrants. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds before expenses of approximately $9.65 million from the exercise of the remaining Existing Warrants held by the Holder and the payment of the purchase price for the New Warrants (together, the “2021 Warrant Exercise”).
· On October 18, 2021, the Company closed a registered direct offering (the “October 2021 Offering”) with a single healthcare-focused institutional investor of 150,000 shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of common stock. The shares of preferred stock had a stated value of $100 per share and were converted into an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share after the Company received stockholder approval for an increase to its number of authorized shares of common stock, which approval occurred at the Company’s special meeting of stockholders held in December 2021. Thereafter, all preferred stock was converted into 7,500,000 common shares in December 2021 so that there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The warrants have an exercise price of $2.05 per share, will become exercisable six months following the date of issuance, and will expire five years following the initial exercise date. The October 2021 Offering raised aggregate net proceeds of $13.9 million, and gross proceeds of $15.0 million.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenues
The Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 2%, to $4.3 million from $4.2 million, when compared to the same period in 2020. This increase is primarily attributable to:
· Product Sales: the decrease in revenue of approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to the loss of FISH products revenue following the discontinuation of the FISH business, offset, in part, by an increase in the Company’s Unyvero product sales and the non-exclusive access to a portion of the ARESdb content;
· Laboratory Services: the increase in revenue of approximately 385% in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to an increase in Ares Genetics’ laboratory services (approximately $361,000) as well as COVID testing services performed by the Company’s Curetis subsidiary (approximately $438,000); and
· Collaboration Revenue: the decrease in revenue of approximately 38% in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to the conclusion of non-recurring partnering revenues from a completed research and development collaboration with an IVD partner at Ares Genetics in 2020 and non-recurring milestone-based revenue from the NYS project.
Operating expenses
The Company’s total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 2%, to $27.6 million from $26.9 million, when compared to the same period in 2020. This increase is primarily attributable to:
· Costs of products sold: expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 32% when compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of products sold is primarily attributable to the discontinuance of the Company’s FISH line of products, partially offset by increased costs due to the sale of Curetis products;
· Costs of services: expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 13% when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in cost of services is primarily attributable to an increase in laboratory service revenue in 2021;
· Research and development: expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 9% when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the inclusion of four quarters of such expenses for Curetis and Ares Genetics in 2021 compared to only three quarters of such expenses in 2020, as a result of the Company’s business combination transaction with Curetis closing at the beginning of April 2020;
· General and administrative: expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 13% when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of four quarters of such expenses for Curetis and Ares Genetics in 2021 compared to only three quarters of such expenses in 2020, as a result of the Company’s business combination with Curetis closing at the beginning of April 2020;
· Sales and marketing: expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately 20% when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of four quarters of such expenses for Curetis and Ares Genetics in 2021 compared to only three quarters of such expenses in 2020, as a result of the Company’s business combination with Curetis closing at the beginning of April 2020, partially offset by lower travel costs;
· Transaction costs: transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 represent one-time costs incurred as part of the business combination with Curetis;
· Impairment of right-of-use asset: impairment of right-of-use asset for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents the impairment of our San Diego, California ROU asset. Impairment of right-of-use asset for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the impairment of our Woburn, Massachusetts ROU asset;
· Impairment of intangible assets: impairment of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the write down of intangible assets acquired from AdvanDx in 2015; and
· Gain on sale of equipment: gain on sale of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the sale of laboratory equipment to one of our vendors.
Other expense
Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to a net expense of $11,488,848 from a net expense of $3,359,962 in the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to warrant inducement expense recorded in 2021 and an increase in interest expense associated with the debt assumed as part of the Transaction with Curetis.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $36.1 million, compared to $13.4 million at December 31, 2020. The Company has funded its operations primarily through external investor financing arrangements and has raised significant funds in 2021 and 2020, including:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 7,521,610 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $15.8 million, and gross proceeds of $16.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 680,000 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $1.48 million, and gross proceeds of $1.55 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 4.3 million common warrants issued in our October 2019 public offering were exercised for net proceeds of approximately $8.7 million.
On November 25, 2020, we closed the 2020 PIPE of (i) 2,245,400 shares of common stock, (ii) 4,842,615 warrants to purchase shares of common stock and (iii) 2,597,215 pre-funded warrants. The offering raised gross proceeds of approximately $10.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $9.3 million.
On February 11, 2021, we closed the February 2021 Offering for the purchase of (i) 2,784,184 shares of common stock, (ii) 5,549,149 pre-funded warrants, and (iii) unregistered common share purchase warrants to purchase 4,166,666 shares. The February 2021 Offering raised aggregate net proceeds of $23.5 million, and gross proceeds of $25.0 million.
On March 9, 2021, we closed the 2021 Warrant Exercise resulting in the issuance of 4,842,615 shares of common stock and raising gross proceeds of approximately $9.65 million and net proceeds of $9.3 million.
On October 18, 2021, we closed the October 2021 Offering of 150,000 shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of common stock. The October 2021 Offering raised aggregate net proceeds of $13.9 million, and gross proceeds of $15.0 million.
We expect that we will need to obtain additional funding to sustain our future operations and while we have successfully raised capital in the past, the ability to raise capital in future periods is not assured. Based on our available cash as of December 31, 2021, we will need to raise additional capital in the next twelve months to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan to obtain additional capital may include additional equity or debt financings.
Sources and uses of cash
The following table summarizes the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated:
Net cash used in operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities in 2021 consisted primarily of our net loss of $34.8 million, reduced by certain non-cash items, including warrant inducement expense of $7.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million, non-cash interest of $4.0 million, share-based compensation of $0.9 million, partially offset by gains on debt forgiveness of $0.3 million and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities in 2020 consisted primarily of our net loss of $26.2 million, reduced by certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $2.3 million, non-cash interest of $2.6 million, share-based compensation of $0.3 million, partially offset by gains on debt forgiveness of $0.9 million, changes in warrant liabilities of $0.5 million, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.7 million.
Net cash used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 consisted of the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of funds provided to Curetis GmbH as part of the Interim Facility, offset by the acquisition of Curetis net of cash acquired of $1.3 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 of $47.5 million consisted primarily of net proceeds from the February 2021 Offering, 2021 Warrant Exercise, October 2021 Offering, and our 2020 ATM Offering. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 of $34.1 million consisted primarily of net proceeds from the 2020 PIPE, 2020 ATM Offering and exercises of common stock warrants and the issuance of debt.
Funding requirements
Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, including our research and development and commercialization expenditures as well as general administrative and corporate purposes. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:
· the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of research and development programs, including analytical studies and clinical trials for our products;
· the clinical development plans we establish for these products;
· the number and characteristics of products that we develop;
· the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
· the terms of our existing and any future license or collaboration agreements we may choose to enter into, including the amount of upfront, milestone and royalty obligations;
· the other costs associated with in-licensing new technologies, such as any increased costs of research and development and personnel;
· the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
· the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or our product candidates;
· the effect of competing technological and market developments;
· the degree of commercial success achieved following the successful completion of development and regulatory approval activities for our products;
· the cost to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and
· the cost to comply with our obligations as a public company.
We intend to spend substantial amounts on research and development activities, including product development, regulatory and compliance, clinical studies in support of our future product offerings, and commercial activities. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $25.2 million, including deferred interest of approximately $4.8 million, due under our senior, unsecured loan financing facility with the EIB. Approximately $15 million is due under such facility in April 2022. Management may repay such amount in cash or through the issuance of additional equity to the EIB or other restructuring transactions with the EIB. We cannot assure you that additional financing will not be required in the future to support our operations. We intend to use financing opportunities strategically to continue to strengthen our financial position.
Critical Accounting Estimates
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In our audited consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, liquidity assumptions, revenue recognition, share-based compensation, allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence, valuation of derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, and the recoverability of long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or complex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Business Combinations
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and debt instruments.
Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer/distributions relationships, developed technology, and in-process research & development discount rates, and terminal values. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but actual results may differ from estimates.
We determine the fair value of assumed debt using a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. Differences between the fair value and the stated value is recorded as a discount or premium and amortized over the remaining term using the effective interest method. We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation method to determine the fair value of conversion notes, which utilizes inputs including the common stock price, volatility of common stock, the risk-free interest rate and the probability of conversion to common shares at the conversion rate.
Other estimates associated with the accounting for the acquisition may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 4 - Business Combination of the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenues from (i) the sale of Unyvero Application cartridges, Unyvero Systems, SARS CoV-2 tests, Acuitas AMR Gene Panel test products, (ii) providing laboratory services, (iii) providing collaboration services including funded software arrangements, and license arrangements, and (iv) granting access to a small subset of the proprietary ARESdb data asset.
The Company analyzes contracts to determine the appropriate revenue recognition using the following steps: (i) identification of contracts with customers, (ii) identification of distinct performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determination of contract transaction price, (iv) allocation of contract transaction price to the performance obligations and (v) determination of revenue recognition based on timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation.
The Company recognizes revenues upon the satisfaction of its performance obligation (upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to our customers) in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company defers incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract and amortizes the deferred costs over the period that the goods and services are transferred to the customer. The Company had no material incremental costs to obtain customer contracts in any period presented.
Deferred revenue results from amounts billed in advance to customers or cash received from customers in advance of services being provided.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which we can identify assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, impairment is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Finite-lived intangible assets include trademarks, developed technology, software and customer relationships. If any indicators were present, the Company would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount (i.e., the asset is not recoverable), the Company would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any.
Acquired In-Process Research & Development represents the fair value assigned to those research and development projects that were acquired in a business combination for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. IPR&D is capitalized at its fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and any development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon achieving regulatory approval or commercial viability for the related product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a finite-lived asset and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. If the project is not completed or is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR&D which is charged to expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid when the Company acquired AdvanDx, Inc. in July 2015 and Curetis in April 2020, over the fair values of the acquired tangible or intangible assets and assumed liabilities. The Company will conduct an impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis as of December 31 of each year and will also conduct tests if events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the Company’s fair value below its net equity value.
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based payments to employees, directors and consultants are recognized at fair value. The resulting fair value is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the option. The estimated fair value of equity instruments issued to nonemployees is recorded at fair value on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed.
For all time-vesting awards granted, expense is amortized using the straight-line attribution method. For awards that contain a performance condition, expense is amortized using the accelerated attribution method. Share-based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The fair value of share-based payments is estimated, on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes model. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, require the input of highly subjective estimates and assumptions, and changes in those estimates and assumptions can materially affect the grant-date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the fair value of the underlying and the expected life of the award.
See additional discussion of the use of estimates relating to share-based compensation, and a discussion of management’s methodology for developing each of the assumptions used in such estimates, in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
