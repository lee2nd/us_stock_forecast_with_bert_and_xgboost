The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
Business
Headquartered in Pittsford, New York, Infinite Group is a developer of cybersecurity software and related cybersecurity consulting, advisory and managed information security services. We principally sell our software and services through indirect channels such as MSPs, MSSPs, agents and distributors and government contractors, whom we refer to collectively as our channel partners. We also sell directly to end customers.
We believe our ability to succeed depends on how successful we are in differentiating ourselves in the cybersecurity market at a time when competition and consolidation in these markets are on the rise. Our strategy to differentiate our cybersecurity software and services from our competitors is to combine customized software and professional services, and grow our business by designing, developing, and marketing cybersecurity SaaS solutions that can be deployed in myriad environments. Software and services are initially developed in our wholly-owned subsidiary, IGI CyberLabs, to fill technology gaps we identify, and then we bring these software and services to market through our existing channel partner and customer relationships. Our software and services are designed to simplify and manage the security needs of our customers and channel partners in a variety of environments. We focus on the small and medium-sized enterprises market. We support our channel partners by providing recurring-revenue business models for both services and through our cybersecurity SaaS solutions. Products may be sold as standalone solutions or integrated into existing environments to further automate the management of cybersecurity and related IT functions.
Business Strategy
We have a threefold business strategy composed of:
·
providing differentiated cybersecurity software and services to small to mid-sized enterprises who lack the internal resources to focus on cybersecurity related matters by combining customized software and professional services;
·
designing, developing, and marketing cybersecurity SaaS solutions, including Nodeware; and
·
identifying other cybersecurity companies to acquire as part of a strategic roll-up strategy.
We believe our ability to succeed depends on how successful we are in differentiating ourselves in the market at a time when competition and consolidation in these markets is on the rise.
Our software and services are designed to simplify the security needs of our customers and channel partners, with a focus on the small to mid-sized enterprises, and be believe our ability to integrate our product and service offerings differentiates them from our competitors. In addition, we support our channel partners by providing recurring -revenue business models for both services and our cybersecurity SaaS solutions.
Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, so we devote significant efforts in developing proprietary software and services to meet our customer and channel partners’ evolving needs. These efforts have resulted in the development of our patented and patent-pending Nodeware solution. We expect to continue to make significant investments in developing other intellectual property to serve as the core to other proprietary software and services.
Historically, a significant portion of our revenues has been derived through our managed support services, however, we believe our cybersecurity SaaS solutions, including Nodeware, present an opportunity for significant growth. We believe that Nodeware’s ability to be deployed across a wide variety of networks and the ability to integrate it into existing and new cybersecurity solutions, will allow us to significantly grow this segment of our business. Similarly, we believe Nodeware’s SaaS recurring revenue business model and its flexibility as a standalone or integrated solution makes it an attractive part of our channel partners’ portfolio of products. Accordingly, in 2021 we made significant investments in IGI and CyberLabs sales and marketing to grow our team of cybersecurity sales and technical consultants. As a result, we believe we are seeing the pipeline growth expected from focused efforts, which we anticipate will convert to revenue growth in 2022.
We believe the market for cybersecurity services for small and medium-sized enterprises is fragmented and does not currently meet the needs of this customer base. The market is fragmented and is beginning to consolidate, which is why we are seeking to strategically acquire other cybersecurity technology and services companies.
Recent Developments
On December 15, 2021, our Board approved a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock by a ratio within the range of 3-to-1 and 75-to-1 of our outstanding shares of common stock and recommended that the stockholders of the Company authorize the Board, in its discretion, for one year, to determine the final ratio, effective date, and date of filing of the certificate of amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, in connection with the reverse stock split. On January 26, 2022, the company’s stockholder voted to authorize the reverse stock split. As of the date of this report, the Board has not set a record date or a ratio for the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will not impact the number of authorized shares of common stock which will remain at 60,000,000 shares. All option, share and per share information in this prospectus does not give effect to the reverse stock split.
In accordance with our strategic roll-up strategy, on January 31, 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire the issued and outstanding equity securities of Pratum, an Iowa corporation and an information securities firm. Pratum provides cybersecurity consulting and advisory services, risk assessments, and managed XDR services. The aggregate purchase price under the Pratum agreements is $8,500,000, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for, among other things, indebtedness of Pratum as of the closing. $8,000,000 will be paid to Pratum’s shareholder at closing and $500,000 will be deposited at closing with an escrow agent to be held in escrow for a period of six months. It is anticipated that the transaction will close in the first half of 2022. Pratum will keep its name and operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. For more information, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2022.
Results of Operations - Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The following information should be considered together with our financial statements for such periods and the accompanying notes thereto.
The following table compares our statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Certain trends suggested by this table are not indicative of future operating results.
Sales
Our managed support service sales decreased by 7.4% from $4,669,570 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 to $4,325,067 during the corresponding period of 2021. VMWare represented a decrease of approximately $232,000 and Managed Information Security Services decreased by approximately $113,000. Managed support service sales accounted for approximately 60% of our sales in 2021 and approximately 65% for the same period in 2020. The decline in our managed support service sales during 2021 was due to the continued declines of virtualization subcontract projects assigned to us by VMWare and existing projects coming to a conclusion. The decline in virtualization subcontracting projects has been a trend occurring since 2015 and we discontinued the business in 2021. We expect our Managed Information Security Services sales to remain steady in 2022.
Our cybersecurity software and services sales, primarily to SMEs, increased by 22.2% to $2,793,057 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $2,285,876 during the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in cybersecurity software and services sales during 2021 was attributable to increased sales efforts of our sales team in finding new customers. We expect our cybersecurity software and services business to continue to grow due to our expanding salesforce, channel and marketing programs.
Other IT consulting services sales decreased by $145,000 or 54.9% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. The decline in other IT consulting services sales was due to the termination of a consulting contract, which occurred during the first half of 2021.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales principally represents the compensation expense for our employees (primarily the cost of our IT services group). In smaller amounts, we also incurred cost of sales for third party software licenses for our commercial SME partners. Cost of sales increased by 7.5% to $4,489,306 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $4,177,268 during the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in cost of sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from 2020 was due to an increase in salaried employees amounting to an increase of approximately $368,000 to support our cybersecurity software and services team, partially offset by a reduction in headcount of hourly employees in supporting our managed support services (approximately $73,000).
Gross profit decreased by 10.1% to approximately $2,734,936 for 2021 The primary driver of the reduction in gross profit was the increase in cost of sales in 2021 from 2020 due to the cost of the three new salaried employees to support our cybersecurity software and services team.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include corporate overhead such as compensation and benefits for executive, administrative and finance personnel, rent, insurance, professional fees, travel, and office expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $462,963 in 2021 due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits of approximately $165,000, consulting expenses of approximately $137,000, and legal fees of approximately $161,000. Corporate marketing expenses decreased by approximately $54,000.
Selling Expenses
The increase of $638,655 in selling expenses to $1,983,127 in 2021 is principally due to the increase of employee salaries, commissions and benefits totaling approximately $403,000 due primarily to the growth to the cyber security and CyberLabs leadership and sales teams. The remaining increase is attributable to several smaller items including amortization of development labor, marketing and consulting fees.
Operating Income (Loss)
The decrease of approximately $1,408,860 in our operating income for 2021 is attributable to a decrease in gross profit of $307,242, an increase in our general and administrative expenses of $462,963 and our selling expenses of $638,655. The decrease in our operating income from the previous year is principally attributable to the growth of our sales team and the associated costs as well as consulting and legal fees incurred for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020.
Other Income
In 2021, we settled the long-term debt agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) for $200,000 on the outstanding principal of $246,000 and accrued interest of approximately $74,500. We recorded a gain of approximately $120,500 at that time of forgiveness. In 2020, we received a Paycheck Protection Plan (“PPP”) loan which was subsequently forgiven in the 4th quarter of 2020. We recorded $963,516 of other income at that time of forgiveness. These events are non-recurring.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense decreased by approximately $10,553 and includes interest on indebtedness, amortization of loan fees, cost of stock options as part of debt agreements and fees for financing accounts receivable invoices. The decrease in interest expense is principally attributable to stock option costs from 2020 which did not occur in 2021. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the non-cash options expense issued for loan financing consideration of approximately $69,300 during 2020 offset by the associated interest of approximately $54,000 from the Mast Hill Bridge Loan in 2021.
Net Income (loss)
The decrease in net income (loss) is attributable primarily to the selling, general and administrative items discussed above for 2021 as compared to 2020 due to our focus on growing and developing the Cybersecurity Services and CyberLabs segments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, we had cash of $99,432 available for working capital needs and planned capital asset expenditures and a working capital deficit of approximately $3,062,000 with a current ratio of 0.25.
During 2021, our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by collections of accounts receivable and our factoring line of credit. We maintain an accounts receivable financing line of credit with an independent financial institution that allows us to sell selected accounts receivable invoices to the financial institution with full recourse against us in the amount of $2,000,000, including a sublimit for one major client of $1,500,000. This provides us with the cash needed to finance certain of our on-going costs and expenses. At December 31, 2021, based on eligible accounts receivable, we had $66,000 available under this arrangement. We expect sales during 2022 to generate additional accounts receivable eligible for factoring, that will support our operations. We pay fees based on the length of time that the invoice remains unpaid.
At December 31, 2021, we had current notes payable of $229,000 to related parties. $100,000 of this debt is due on March 31, 2022. The remaining $129,000 are in the form of demand notes with an interest rate of 6%.
At December 31, 2021, we have current notes payable of approximately $384,000 to third parties, which includes convertible notes payable of approximately $150,000. Also included is $12,500 in principal amount of a note payable due on June 30, 2016 but not paid by then. This note was issued in payment of software we purchased in February 2016 and secured by a security interest in the software. To date, the holder has not taken any action to collect the amount past due on this note or to enforce the security interest in the software.
Also included in the current notes payable is the Bridge Loan with Mast Hill Fund, L.P, which bears interest at a rate of 8%. We plan to use the proceeds from the Bridge Loan to substantially enhance our marketing of CyberLab’s Nodeware solution, in order to significantly increase its growth. A total of approximately $272,000 was recorded as deferred note costs associated with this transaction. At December 31, 2021, the unamortized balance of the deferred note costs was approximately, $227,000. See Note 6 of the 2021 Audited Financial Statements for more information.
At December 31, 2021, we also have an accrued liability for the voluntary match portion of a former simple IRA plan, including interest, of approximately $275,000. We do not anticipate distributing this liability in the next year or two. Interest will continue to accrue.
We have $765,000 of current maturities of long-term obligations to third parties. This is composed of two notes including long-term notes to third parties of $265,000 due on January 1, 2018, which has not been renewed or amended, and $500,000 due on December 31, 2021. The accrued interest on these notes and current maturities is approximately $281,000 at December 31, 2021. These notes have not been paid. We plan to renegotiate the terms of the notes payable, offset with amounts owed to us, seek funds to repay the notes or use a combination of the alternatives.
We have $190,000 of current maturities of long-term obligations to related parties. This is composed of the scheduled payment of $100,000 to an officer of the company on March 31, 2022 and a scheduled payment of $90,000 on July 1, 2022. The accrued interest of these notes is approximately $33,700 at December 31, 2021.
We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to repay current notes payable or obtain extensions of maturity dates for long term notes payable when they mature or that we will be able to repay or otherwise refinance the notes at their schedules maturities.
On January 14, 2022, we file a registration statement for a public offering of $15 million in equity securities. There can be no assurance that this offering will be successful.
Our ability to raise the additional capital is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common stock, which itself is subject to a number of development and business risks and uncertainties, our creditworthiness and the uncertainty that we would be able to raise such additional capital at a price that is favorable to us. In addition, our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by deteriorating global economic conditions and the recent or future disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. With regards to our existing debt, if the equity raise is not successful, we plan to restructure the debt, convert debt to equity or pay down appropriate debt. We may also increase ownership via exercising of stock options and the potential sale of restricted stock. If adequate funds are not available when needed, we may need to significantly reduce our operations while we seek strategic alternatives, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives including new software initiatives.
We do not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities or off-balance sheet arrangements.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flow information for the years presented, described below, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements appearing at Item 15, Page, et seq., of this report.
Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities
Our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, and our ability to manage our vendor payments. We bill our clients weekly or monthly after services are performed, depending on the contract terms. Our net loss of $1,568,813 for 2021 was increased by non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, bad debt expense, amortization of debt discount and stock-based compensation of $364,857 and decreased for non-cash adjustments for forgiveness of debt of $120,505. In addition, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $626,328 was offset by increases in accounts receivable and other assets of $153,316 resulted in net cash used in operating activities of $544,817.
We are increasing our marketing of Nodeware to our IT channel partners who resell to their customers. We are making investments in our cyber security team for penetration testing, CISOTaaS and other services. Due to the lengthy lead times typically needed to generate these new sales, we do not expect to realize a return from our sales and marketing personnel for one or more quarters. As a result, we may continue to experience small operating income or operating losses from these investments in personnel until sufficient sales are generated. We expect to fund the cost for the new sales personnel from our operating cash flows, the equity raise and incremental borrowings, as needed.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
In 2020 and 2021, we incurred capital expenditures for computer hardware as well as software development labor for the enhancements to Nodeware. The slight decrease from 2020 was primarily due to less development activities in 2021 that were capitalized. We expect to continue to invest in computer hardware and software to update our technology to support the growth of our business. We do not anticipate our continued investment to be significant.
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities
During 2021, we received $378,040 from a bridge loan from the Mast Hill Fund L.P. We borrowed $249,000 from a related party under the terms of a note payable. The note allows for up to $500,000 credit and is due in August 2026. During 2019 and 2020, we borrowed $250,000 from the $500,000 credit note. We also borrowed $329,000 from other related parties during 2021, of which $100,000 was extinguished with common stock. During 2021, we paid $200,000 to the PBGC to settle all outstanding indebtedness and terminate all commitments and obligations under its original promissory note dated October 17, 2011, and the First Amended Agreement dated March 15, 2015. The Company recorded a gain of $120,505 as part of the transaction. We also received $98,930 from the exercising of stock options during 2021.
We plan to evaluate alternatives which may include renegotiating the terms of the notes, seeking conversion of the notes to shares of common stock and seeking funds to repay the notes. We continue to evaluate repayment of our notes payable based on our cash flow. If the equity raise is successful, we plan to pay down a portion of the debt.
Credit Resources
We maintain an accounts receivable financing line of credit from an independent financial institution that allows us to sell selected accounts receivable invoices to the financial institution with full recourse against us in the amount of $2,000,000, including a sublimit for one major client of $1,500,000. This provides us with the cash needed to finance certain costs and expenses. At December 31, 2021, we had financing availability, based on eligible accounts receivable, of approximately $66,000 under this line. We pay fees based on the length of time that the invoice remains unpaid. We also have approximately $16,000 of available credit under various lines of credit as of December 31, 2021.
During May 2019, we originated a line of credit note payable for a $500,000 with a related party and borrowed $499,000 and have $1,000 available to borrow for working capital. This agreement matures in August 2026.
During 2017, we originated two lines of credit with related parties totaling $175,000. At December 31, 2021, we had $15,000 available under these financing agreements which mature in July 2022 and January 2023, respectively.
We believe the capital resources available under our factoring line of credit, cash from additional related party loans and cash generated by improving the results of our operations will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for at least the next 12 months. The funds from the equity raise will allow us to support and accelerate the internal growth of our operations and offer additional opportunities if they arise.
We anticipate financing growth from acquisitions of other businesses, if any, and our longer-term internal growth through one or more of the following sources: issuance of equity: cash from collections of accounts receivable; additional borrowing from related and third parties; use of our existing accounts receivable credit facility; or a refinancing of our accounts receivable credit facility.
