Introduction
The Marygold Companies, Inc. (“The Marygold Companies” or the “Company”) conducts business through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries operating in the U.S., New Zealand and Canada. The operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are more particularly described herein but are summarized as follows:
●
USCF Investments, Inc. (“USCF Investments”), a U.S. based company, is the sole member of two investment services limited liability company subsidiaries that manages, operates or is an investment advisor to exchange traded funds organized as limited partnerships or investment trusts that issue shares that trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange.
●

(collectively "Gourmet Foods")
●

●

●

Advisory Services, LLC, ( collectively "Marygold") was established by The Marygold Companies to explore opportunities in the financial technology ("Fintech") space, still in the development stage as of June 30, 2022, and estimated to launch commercial services in the coming fiscal year. Through June 30, 2021, expenditures have been limited to developing the business model and the associated application development.
●
Marygold & Co. (UK) Limited, a newly formed U.K. limited company, together with its newly acquired UK subsidiary, Tiger Financial and Asset Management, Ltd. (collectively “Marygold UK”) is an asset manager and registered investment advisor in the UK. Operations began on June 20, 2022.
Because the Company conducts its businesses through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, the risks related to our wholly-owned subsidiaries are also risks that impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. See, "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies / Major Customers and Suppliers - Concentration of Credit Risk" in the consolidated financial statements for more information. The emergence of a novel coronavirus on a global scale, known as COVID-19, and related geopolitical events could lead to increased market volatility, disruption to U.S. and world economies and markets and may have significant adverse effects on the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The financial risk to future operations is largely unknown, (refer to Part I, Item 1A, for further details.)
Critical Accounting Policies
We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principals ("US GAAP" or "GAAP") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from those estimates.
We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Business Combinations - Purchase Price Allocation
We are a diversified holding company whose activities involve the acquisition of operating companies through stock purchase or asset purchase transactions. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to intangible assets, including goodwill, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. We use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances, including the income approach and use of independent valuation firms. Significant estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase consideration over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. See Note 8 for further detail on goodwill. Management’s estimate of fair value is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, and are supported by independent valuations where possible, but nevertheless remain subjective and subject to future adjustment if actual results differ from the estimates.
Foreign Subsidiaries
We currently have three wholly-owned subsidiaries that are domiciled in foreign countries. In the future we may acquire additional foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are kept in accordance with their respective local jurisdictions and require adjustment in order to conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, local currencies of these subsidiaries require conversion to our US dollar in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Due to changing currency translation rates, the value of our assets and liabilities held in foreign jurisdictions are inherently volatile in nature and may vary significantly despite our use of averages and estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Our operating subsidiaries derive revenues from a number of sources including sales of hardware, services, food items, printing, financial services, and consumer products. The company recognizes the revenue when the product or service is delivered, or the ownership of the product is deemed to have been transferred to the buyer. We carefully monitor the outgoings of product shipments and service completions to ensure revenues are properly recorded. In the case of continued support services, such as warranty or extended contracts, the company makes an assessment at each reporting period as to the significance of the cost of such support or warranty. This estimate is based on historical experience and careful monitoring of costs throughout the reporting period to determine if any reserve should be recorded for estimated expenses. We believe we have made careful and reasonable estimates, however adjustments may be required in the future if actual results vary from our estimates.
Plan of Operation for the Next Twelve Months
Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to apply necessary resources, which may include experienced personnel, cash, or synergistic acquisitions made with cash, equity or debt, into growing each of our business units to their potential. Original Sprout has found it necessary to alter its approach through domestic distribution channels. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer shopping habits, many domestic distributors have found it advantageous to sell direct to consumers online, thus becoming retailers in lieu of distributors. The result has been an erosion of profit margins and a fragmented sales channel which have slowed the product roll out plans of Original Sprout. They are in the final stages of correcting this situation and, in spite of incurring losses as a result, expect to realize significant growth in sales volume and profits in the coming fiscal year. Additionally, we are expecting moderate growth in Brigadier through focused management initiatives and partnering with local telecoms and contractors. Similarly, we expect Gourmet Foods to be operating more efficiently as low margin products are eliminated, new channels to market are established, and the printing and sale of food wrappers by their subsidiary, Printstock, continue to improve. USCF Investments will continue to develop innovative and new fund products to grow its portfolio. In addition to our long-term mission that is an acquisition strategy based upon identifying and acquiring profitable, mature, companies of a diverse nature and with in-place management that produces increased revenue streams, the Company is also focused upon building expertise and developing Fintech opportunities in the financial services sector through its development stage subsidiary Marygold and Co. To augment that effort, the Company established a subsidiary in England, Marygold UK, who acquired a registered UK investment advisor, Tiger Financial and Asset Management (“Tiger”). We hope to leverage the client list, industry experience, and banking relationships of Tiger to project our Marygold & Co fintech offerings in the UK during the coming fiscal year. In a more general sense, the Company is characterizing its business in two categories: 1) financial services and 2) other consumer-based operating units. The purpose is to isolate the cyclical, and sometimes volatile, nature of the financial services business from our other industry segments. As revenues from financial services fluctuate over time due to varying performance of the commodities markets, our other operations are expected to be stable and sustainable by comparison. By these initiatives we seek to:
●
continue to gain market share for our wholly-owned subsidiaries’ areas of operation,
●
increase our revenues and realize net operating profits,
●
lower our operating costs by unburdening certain selling expenses to third party distributors,
●
have sufficient cash reserves to pay down accrued expenses.
●
attract parties who have an interest in selling their privately held companies to us,
●
achieve efficiencies in accounting and reporting through adoption of standards used by all subsidiaries on a consistent basis,
●
strategically pursue additional company acquisitions, and
●
launch of services by Marygold & Co., Marygold UK, and Marygold & Co. Advisory Services LLC, and the creation of new corporate entities as focused subsidiary holdings.
Results of Operations
For the Year Ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue and Operating Income
Consolidated revenue for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $37.8 million representing a $2.1 million decrease from the prior year revenue of $39.9 million. The decrease in consolidated revenues is primarily attributed to the decrease in annual revenues of USCF Investments. USCF Investments' average Assets Under Management ("AUM") for the year ended June 30, 2022 was lower than that of 2021, which resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $1.3 million. The other subsidiaries combined for a total decrease in revenues of approximately $740 thousand, in part due to a loss in currency translation between the New Zealand dollar the U.S. dollar. The Marygold Companies produced an operating income for the year ended June 30, 2022 of $2.4 million as compared to $7.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. This represents a decrease in operating income of $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 when compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 or approximately 125%. Apart from the $2.1 million decline in revenues, the difference in operating income is attributed to the expenses incurred by our subsidiary, Marygold & Co., in development of its mobile fintech app, which amounted to approximately $3.1 million, and a legal settlement of $2.5 million incurred by our USCF Investments subsidiary.
Other Income (Expenses)
Other (expense) income for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were ($22) thousand and $216 thousand, respectively, resulting in income before income tax of $2.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively.
Income Tax
Provision for income tax for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 are $1.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, primarily attributable to our United States operations through our USCF Investments subsidiary. Income tax expense recorded at The Marygold Companies level totaled $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, while a tax expense of $1.5 million was recorded for the year ended June 30, 2021. The remaining income tax expense was recorded at the subsidiary level during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Net Income
Overall, the net income between the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 decreased by approximately $4.8 million, or approximately 83%, to approximately $1.1 million. The decrease in net income for the year ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to lower fund management revenue from USCF Investments due to a lower amount of AUM coupled with approximately $3 million expensed in Marygold for the mobile fintech app development costs and legal settlement cost of $2.5 million.
Comprehensive Income
After giving consideration to currency translation loss of approximately $0.4 million our comprehensive income for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $0.8 million as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 where there was a currency translation gain of $0.3 million which resulted in comprehensive income of $6.2 million. Comprehensive gain and loss are comprised of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and effects in the valuation of our holdings in the U.K., New Zealand and Canada.
Investment Fund Management - USCF Investments
USCF Investments was founded as a holding company in March 2004 as a Delaware corporation with one subsidiary, Ameristock Corporation, which was an investment adviser to Ameristock Mutual Fund, Inc., a large cap value equity fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In January 2010, Ameristock Corporation was spun off as a standalone company. In May 2005, USCF was formed as a single member limited liability company in the state of Delaware. In June 2013, USCF Advisers was formed as a Delaware limited liability company and in July 2014, was registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. In November 2013, the USCF Advisers board of managers formed USCF ETF Trust (“ETF Trust”) as an open-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. The Trust is authorized to have multiple segregated series or portfolios. USCF Investments owns all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership interests of its subsidiaries, USCF and USCF Advisers, each a Delaware limited liability company and are affiliated companies. USCF serves as the general partner (“General Partner”) for various limited partnerships (“LP”) and sponsor (“Sponsor”) as noted below. USCF and USCF Advisers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to the investment services industry. USCF is a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) under the Commodities Exchange Act (“CEA”). USCF Advisers is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended and has registered as a CPO under the CEA. Exchange traded products (“ETPs”) issued or sponsored by USCF are required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933. USCF Investments operates through USCF and USCF Advisers, which collectively operate twelve exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), regulated by the 1940 Act and 1933 Act, and listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) with a total of approximately $4.9 billion assets under management as of June 30, 2022. USCF Investments and subsidiaries USCF and USCF Advisers are collectively referred to as “USCF Investments” hereafter.
USCF currently serves as the General Partner or the Sponsor to the following commodity pools, each of which is currently conducting a public offering of its shares pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended:
USCF Advisers, a registered investment adviser, serves as the investment adviser to the funds listed below within the USCF ETF Trust (the “ETF Trust”) and has overall responsibility for the general management and administration for the ETF Trust. Pursuant to the current Investment Advisory Agreements, USCF Advisers provides an investment program for each of series within the ETF Trust and manages the investment of the assets.
All commodity pools managed by USCF and each series of the ETF Trust managed by USCF Advisers are collectively referred to as the “Funds” hereafter.
USCF Investments' revenue and expenses are primarily driven by the amount of AUM. USCF Investments earns monthly management and advisory fees based on agreements with each Fund as determined by the contractual basis point management fee structure in each agreement multiplied by the average AUM over the given period. Many of the company’s expenses are dependent upon the amount of AUM. These variable expenses include Fund administration, custody, accounting, transfer agency, marketing and distribution, and sub-adviser fees and are primarily determined by multiplying contractual fee rates by AUM. Total Operating Expenses are grouped into the following financial statement line items: General and Administrative, Marketing, Operations and Salaries and Compensation.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2022, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue
Average AUM for the year ended June 30, 2022 was at $4.4 billion, as compared to approximately $4.9 billion from the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in AUM at USO, BNO and USL. As a result, the revenues from management and advisory fees decreased by approximately $1.4 million, or 5%, to $23.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 where revenues from management and advisory fees totaled $25.2 million.
Expenses
USCF Investments’ total operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by $1.5 million, after recording the $2.5 million Wells Notice payment, to $16.7 million, or approximately 10%, from $15.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. Variable expenses, as described above, increased by $0.8 million over the respective twelve-month period due to higher AUM for UMI and USCI during the fiscal year which resulted in higher sub-advisory fees, partially offset by lower marketing and distribution expenses and other variable costs from other funds with lower average AUM during the fiscal year. General and Administrative expenses decreased $1.3 million to $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 from $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 due to a $0.8 million decrease in expense waivers as a result of eliminating expense waivers for BNO, UGA and CPER in May 2021 along with a $0.5 million decrease in legal and professional expenses. Total marketing expenses decreased $0.1 million to $2.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior year period due to a decrease in marketing distribution costs as a result of lower overall AUM, partially offset by increases in advertising and marketing conferences. Other Operating expenses increased by $0.9 million primarily due to higher sub-adviser fees as result of higher AUM for UMI and USCI, partially offset by lower fund administration expense due to lower average AUM from other funds. Employee Salaries and Compensation expenses were approximately $4.9 million and $5.4 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, primarily due to moving three employees to The Marygold Companies parent to better align functions and the related expense across the entities.
Income
Income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2022 decreased $2.9 million to $7.1 million from $10.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 due to a $1.4 million decrease in revenue as a result of lower AUM, a $1.5 million increase in operating expenses, and after recording the $2.5 million legal settlement expense.
Food Products - Gourmet Foods, Ltd.
Gourmet Foods was organized in its current form in 2005 (previously known as Pats Pantry Ltd). Pats Pantry was founded in 1966 to produce and sell wholesale bakery products, meat pies and patisserie cakes and slices, in New Zealand. Gourmet Foods, located in Tauranga, New Zealand, sells substantially all of its goods to supermarkets and service station chains with stores located throughout New Zealand. Gourmet Foods also has a large number of smaller independent lunch bars, cafes and corner dairies among the customer list, however they comprise a relatively insignificant dollar volume in comparison to the primary accounts of large distributors and retailers. On July 1, 2020, Gourmet Foods acquired the New Zealand company, Printstock Products Limited ("Printstock"). Located in nearby Napier, New Zealand, Printstock prints wrappers for food products, including those used by Gourmet Foods. Printstock is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gourmet Foods and its operating results are consolidated with those of Gourmet Foods from July 1, 2020 onwards.
Gourmet Foods operates exclusively in New Zealand and thus the New Zealand dollar is its functional currency. In order to consolidate The Marygold Companies’ reporting currency, the US dollar, with that of Gourmet Foods, The Marygold Companies records foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 830, Foreign Currency Matters. The translation of New Zealand currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in foreign currency translation (loss) gain on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as well as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income found on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2022, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $7.9 million with cost of goods sold of $5.9 million resulting in a gross profit of $2.0 million, or approximately 25% gross margin, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 where net revenues were $8.3 million and cost of goods sold were $5.7 million producing a gross profit of $2.6 million, or approximately 31% gross margin. The decrease in revenues is attributed to the decline of the New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar coupled with the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on consumer shopping habits, shipping costs and ingredient availability.
Expenses
General, administrative and selling expenses, including wages and marketing, for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, producing operating income of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, or approximately 4% net operating profit for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 10% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The depreciation expense and other income (expense) totaled approximately ($29) thousand for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to ($157) thousand for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Income
Income for the year ended June 30, 2022, after income tax of $0.1 million, resulted in net income of approximately $0.3 million as compared to a net income of $0.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.

In order to consolidate The Marygold Companies’ reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, with that of Brigadier, The Marygold Companies records foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. The translation of Canadian currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2022, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $2.5 million with cost of goods sold of approximately $1.2 million, resulting in a gross profit of approximately $1.3 million with a gross margin of approximately 54% as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 where net revenues were approximately $2.7 million with cost of goods sold of $1.3 million and a gross profit of $1.4 million, or approximately 53% gross margin.
Expenses
General, administrative and selling expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $1.1 million producing an operating profit of $0.2 million or approximately 10% operating profit margin as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 where general, administrative and selling expenses were $1.2 million producing an operating profit of $0.2 million, or approximately 11% operating profit margin.
Income
Other income (expense) comprised of rental income, commission income, gain on sale of assets, and income tax totaling approximately $12 thousand for the year ended June 30, 2022 resulted in income after income taxes of approximately $0.3 million as compared to income after income taxes of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 with expenses totaling approximately ($6) thousand.
Beauty Products - Original Sprout
Kahnalytics was founded in 2015 and adopted the dba/Original Sprout in December 2017. Original Sprout formulates and packages various hair and skin care products that are 100% vegan, tested safe and non-toxic, and marketed globally through distribution networks to salons, resorts, grocery stores, health food stores, e-tail sites and on the company's website. The company operates from warehouse and sales offices located in San Clemente, CA, USA. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Original Sprout has made adjustments to its primary channels to market. Prior to the pandemic Original Sprout relied heavily upon its wholesale distribution network to place products at retail locations and generally to make products available to consumers, whereas in the current environment of social distancing and closures of retail businesses the company found a significant drop in sales volumes as consumers avoided traditional sales outlets. In response to this trend, Original Sprout has established new sales channels with online retailers and also encouraged those national retail chains who stock the product to also make it available at online shopping carts. The positive effects of this transition are now being realized while at the same time the negative effects of the pandemic on the wholesale distribution business continues to increase for the U.S. market. The result is that sales overall have been relatively stable during the pandemic, though derived from different sources. Contributing to lower profit margins and higher expenses during the current fiscal year are the one-time costs of relocating to a larger facility during December and January, the disposal of obsolete product, the transition to new packaging and new product development.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2022, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $3.5 million with cost of goods sold of approximately $2.1 million resulting in a gross profit of approximately $1.4 million and a gross margin of approximately 41% compared to the year ended June 30, 2021 were net revenues totaled $3.8 million with cost of goods sold of approximately $2.3 million resulting in a gross profit of approximately $1.5 million and a gross margin of approximately 40%.
Expenses
General, administrative and selling expenses for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, resulting in operating (losses) of approximately ($193) thousand and ($210) thousand, respectively.
Income
After consideration given to income tax provision and other income of $5 thousand and $27 thousand, respectively, the net (loss) for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was approximately ($188) thousand and ($192) thousand, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Marygold Companies is a holding company that conducts its operations through its subsidiaries. At the holding-company level, its liquidity needs relate to operational expense, the funding of additional business acquisitions and new investment opportunities. Our operating subsidiaries' principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities, debt service, and capital expenditures, including purchases of equipment and services, operating costs and expenses, and income taxes. Cash is managed at the holding company or the subsidiary level. There are no limitations or constraints on the movement of funds between the entities.
As of June 30, 2022, we had $12.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis as compared to $16.1 million as of June 30, 2021. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the continuing investment in the development of the mobile fintech app by Marygold and the $2.5 million legal settlement expense.
During the past five fiscal years combined, The Marygold Companies has invested an aggregate of approximately $6.6 million in cash towards purchasing and assimilating Printstock within Gourmet Foods, and adding the Original Sprout assets into the The Marygold Companies group of companies as well as forming a new U.K. limited company, Marygold UK, and funding it with enough capital to pay approximately $1.8 million in cash towards the $2.9 million purchase price of its subsidiary, Tiger. We have also invested approximately $6.1 million in the development of Fintech applications through our development stage subsidiary, Marygold. Despite these cash investments and expenses, our working capital position remains strong at $20 million. While The Marygold Companies intends to maintain and improve its revenue stream from wholly owned subsidiaries, The Marygold Companies continues to pursue acquisitions of other profitable companies which meet its target profile. Provided The Marygold Companies’ subsidiaries continue to operate as they are presently, and are projected to operate, The Marygold Companies has sufficient capital to pay its general and administrative expenses for the coming fiscal year and to adequately pursue its long-term business objectives. However, given the significant economic and financial market disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Lease Liability
In relation to the adoption of ASC 842, the Company recognized $1,150,916 of operating lease liabilities on July 1, 2019. The total amount due under these obligations was $1,404,880 and $1,120,631 as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The obligations will reduce over the passage of time through periodic lease payments. See Note 14 for further analysis of this obligation.
Borrowings
As of June 30, 2022, we had $0.4 million of third-party indebtedness on a consolidated basis as compared to $1.0 million of third-party and related-party indebtedness as of June 30, 2021. Approximately US$365,429 is owed by Brigadier and secured with the land and building in Saskatoon purchased in July 2019. The initial principal balance was CD$525,000 (approximately US$401,000 translated as of the loan date July 1, 2019) with an annual interest rate of 4.14% maturing June 30, 2024. The short-term portion of principal for this loan due within 12 months as of June 30, 2021 is CD$19,509 (approximately US$15,135) and the long term principal amount due is CD$451,506 (approximately US$350,293). Interest on the loan is expensed or accrued as it becomes due. Interest expense on the loan for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was US$15,742 and US$16,078, respectively.
In addition to the loan due by Brigadier, our subsidiary, Gourmet Foods, on December 21, 2021 entered into a finance lease agreement related to a solar energy system. The present value of the leased asset is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with property, plant and equipment as US$138,030. The solar assets are amortized over a life span of 10 years with monthly payments, including GST, totaling $12,488 for the year ended June 30, 2022.
