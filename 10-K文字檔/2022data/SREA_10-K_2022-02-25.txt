ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
In 2018, we set out to simplify Sempra’s business model and sharpen our focus on our mission to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company. Our 2021 operational and financial results reflect our focus on executing this strategy:
▪We completed the consolidation of our non-utility, energy infrastructure assets in North America under SI Partners
▪We completed the sale of a 20% NCI in SI Partners to KKR
▪We entered into an agreement to sell an additional 10% NCI in SI Partners to ADIA
▪We invested $5.6 billion in capital expenditures and investments
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we formed Sempra Infrastructure, a new segment that includes the operating companies of our subsidiary, SI Partners, as well as a holding company and certain services companies. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help enable the energy transition in North American markets and globally.
Our former South American businesses and certain activities associated with those businesses are presented as discontinued operations. Nominal activities that are not classified as discontinued operations have been subsumed into Parent and other. We completed the sales of these businesses in the second quarter of 2020. Our discussions below exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We discuss the following in Results of Operations:
▪Overall results of operations of Sempra;
▪Segment results;
▪Significant changes in revenues, costs and earnings; and
▪Impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on our results of operations.
OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SEMPRA
Our earnings and diluted EPS were impacted by variances discussed below in “Segment Results.”
SEGMENT RESULTS
This section presents earnings (losses) by Sempra segment, as well as Parent and other and discontinued operations, and a related discussion of the changes in segment earnings (losses). Throughout the MD&A, our reference to earnings represents earnings attributable to common shares. Variance amounts presented are the after-tax earnings impact (based on applicable statutory tax rates), unless otherwise noted, and before NCI, where applicable.
(1) Includes intercompany eliminations recorded in consolidation and certain corporate costs.
SDG&E
The decrease in earnings of $5 million (1%) in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to:
▪$62 million decrease due to the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 related to 2016-2018 forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account, which we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;
▪$10 million lower electric transmission margin, including the following favorable impacts in 2020 from the March 2020 FERC-approved TO5 settlement proceeding:
◦$18 million to conclude a rate base matter, and
◦$9 million from the retroactive application of the final TO5 settlement for 2019; and
▪$6 million higher income tax expense primarily from flow-through items, net of associated regulatory revenues; offset by
▪$44 million charge in 2020 for amounts to be refunded to customers and a fine related to the Energy Efficiency Program inquiry, which we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and
▪$31 million higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses and favorable resolution of regulatory matters in 2020.
The increase in earnings of $57 million (7%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$62 million increase due to the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 related to 2016-2018 forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account;
▪$52 million higher electric transmission margin, including an increase in authorized ROE and the following favorable impacts in 2020 from the March 2020 FERC-approved TO5 settlement:
◦$18 million to conclude a rate base matter, and
◦$9 million from the retroactive application of the final TO5 settlement for 2019;
▪$23 million higher AFUDC equity; and
▪$16 million higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; offset by
▪$44 million charge in 2020 for amounts to be refunded to customers and a fine related to the Energy Efficiency Program inquiry;
▪$31 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the CPUC directed to be allocated to shareholders in a January 2019 decision;
▪$13 million higher amortization and accretion of the Wildfire Fund asset and liability, respectively; and
▪$12 million higher net interest expense.
SoCalGas
Losses of $427 million in 2021 compared to earnings of $504 million in 2020 was primarily due to:
▪$915 million increase in charges related to civil litigation and regulatory matters pertaining to the Leak comprised of $1,148 million in 2021 compared to $233 million in 2020; and
▪$64 million decrease due to the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 related to 2016-2018 forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account; offset by
▪$23 million higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; and
▪$21 million higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses.
The decrease in earnings of $137 million (21%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$233 million from impacts in 2020 related to civil litigation and regulatory matters pertaining to the Leak;
▪$38 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the impact of the January 2019 CPUC decision allocating certain excess deferred income tax balances to shareholders; and

Sempra Texas Utilities
The increase in earnings of $37 million (6%) in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings driven by increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth, offset by increased operating costs and expenses attributable to invested capital.
The increase in earnings of $51 million (10%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings driven by:
▪increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth;
▪the impact of Oncor’s acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019; and
▪higher AFUDC equity; offset by
▪unfavorable weather and increased operating costs and expenses attributable to invested capital.
Sempra Infrastructure
Because Ecogas, our natural gas distribution utility in Mexico, uses the local currency as its functional currency, its revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in Sempra’s results of operations. Prior year amounts used in the variances discussed below are as adjusted for the difference in foreign currency translation rates between years. We discuss these and other foreign currency effects below in “Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations.”
The increase in earnings of $102 million (18%) in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to:
▪$133 million higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV primarily due to the three-train liquefaction project achieving full commercial operations in August 2020;
▪$55 million higher earnings from asset and supply optimization primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices and higher volumes;
▪$23 million primarily due to the start of commercial operations of the Veracruz terminal in the first quarter of 2021;

▪$147 million earnings attributable to NCI in 2021 compared to $163 million in 2020, including a decrease of $87 million from the increase in our ownership interest in IEnova, offset by an increase of $98 million from the sale of a 20% NCI in SI Partners to KKR, which we discuss in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and
▪$13 million selling profit on a sales-type lease relating to the commencement of a rail facility lease at the Veracruz terminal in the third quarter of 2021; offset by
▪$76 million higher net interest expense primarily due to:
◦$37 million in charges associated with hedge termination costs and a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the early redemptions of debt in October 2021, which we discuss in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
◦$19 million higher interest expense from IEnova’s issuance of senior unsecured notes in September 2020, and
◦$8 million lower net interest income from lower intercompany balances with Parent and other; and
▪$58 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency derivatives effects, comprised of a $47 million unfavorable impact in 2021 compared to an $11 million favorable impact in 2020.
The increase in earnings of $333 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$284 million higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV primarily due to the three-train liquefaction project achieving full commercial operations in August 2020;

▪$21 million lower earnings at the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline primarily from force majeure payments that ended in August 2019; and
▪$13 million lower earnings at TdM primarily due to scheduled major maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Sempra Renewables
As we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sempra Renewables sold its remaining wind assets and investments in April 2019 upon which date the segment ceased to exist. Earnings of $59 million in 2019 included a $45 million gain on such sale.
Parent and Other
The decrease in losses of $127 million (23%) in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to:
▪$50 million equity earnings in 2021 compared to $100 million equity losses in 2020 related to our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities to settle pending VAT matters and related legal costs, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;
▪$105 million lower preferred dividends as a result of $124 million lower dividends due to the mandatory conversion of all series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock in January 2021 and July 2021, respectively, offset by $19 million higher dividends due to the issuance of series C preferred stock in June 2020;

Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations that were previously in our Sempra South American Utilities segment include our former 100% interest in Chilquinta Energía in Chile, our former 83.6% interest in Luz del Sur in Peru and our former interests in two energy-services companies, Tecnored and Tecsur, which provide electric construction and infrastructure services to Chilquinta Energía and Luz del Sur, respectively, as well as third parties. Discontinued operations also include activities, mainly income taxes related to the South American businesses, that were previously included in the holding company of the South American businesses at Parent and other.
As we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the sales of our South American businesses in the second quarter of 2020. On April 24, 2020, we sold our equity interests in our Peruvian businesses, including our 83.6% interest in Luz del Sur and its interest in Tecsur, for cash proceeds of $3,549 million, net of transaction costs and as adjusted for post-closing adjustments, and on June 24, 2020, we sold our equity interests in our Chilean businesses, including our 100% interest in Chilquinta Energía and Tecnored and our 50% interest in Eletrans, for cash proceeds of $2,216 million, net of transaction costs and as adjusted for post-closing adjustments.
Earnings from discontinued operations of $1,840 million in 2020 included:
▪$1,499 million gain on the sale of our Peruvian businesses;
▪$248 million gain on the sale of our Chilean businesses;
▪$98 million operational earnings prior to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses; and
▪$7 million income tax benefit related to changes in outside basis differences from earnings and foreign currency effects.
The increase in earnings from our discontinued operations of $1,512 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$1,499 million gain on the sale of our Peruvian businesses;
▪$248 million gain on the sale of our Chilean businesses; and
▪$7 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to $51 million income tax expense in 2019 related to changes in outside basis differences from earnings and foreign currency effects since the January 25, 2019 approval of our plan to sell our South American businesses; offset by
▪$201 million lower operational earnings mainly as a result of the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses; and
▪$89 million income tax benefit in 2019 related to outside basis differences existing as of January 25, 2019.
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REVENUES, COSTS AND EARNINGS
This section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the Consolidated Statements of Operations for Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas.
Utilities Revenues and Cost of Sales
Our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at SoCalGas and SDG&E and Sempra Infrastructure’s Ecogas and electric revenues at SDG&E. Intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
SoCalGas and SDG&E currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits:
▪The cost of natural gas purchased for core customers (primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers) to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred. SoCalGas’ GCIM provides SoCalGas the opportunity to share in the savings and/or costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly market-based benchmarks. This mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price. Any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between the core customers and SoCalGas.
▪SDG&E to recover the actual cost incurred to generate or procure electricity based on annual estimates of the cost of electricity supplied to customers. The differences in cost between estimates and actual are recovered or refunded in subsequent periods through rates.
▪SoCalGas and SDG&E to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the CPUC, or “refundable programs.”
Because changes in SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s cost of natural gas and/or electricity are recovered in rates, changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings. In addition to the changes in cost or market prices, natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by the difference between customer billings and recorded or CPUC-authorized amounts. These differences are required to be balanced over time, resulting in over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts. We discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
The table below summarizes utilities revenues and cost of sales.
(1) Excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately on the Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Natural Gas Revenues and Cost of Natural Gas
The table below summarizes the average cost of natural gas sold by Sempra California and included in cost of natural gas. The average cost of natural gas sold at each utility is impacted by market prices, as well as transportation, tariff and other charges.

Our utility cost of electric fuel and purchased power includes utility-owned generation and power purchased from third parties, net of sales to the California ISO. The cost of electric fuel and purchased power decreased by $177 million (15%) to $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to:
▪$122 million at SDG&E primarily from higher sales to the California ISO due to higher market prices and lower customer demand; and
▪$55 million higher intercompany eliminations associated with sales between SDG&E and Sempra Infrastructure due to the acquisition of ESJ in March 2021.
Our utility cost of electric fuel and purchased power, substantially all of which is at SDG&E, decreased by $1 million remaining at $1.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:
▪$55 million lower recoverable cost of electric fuel and purchased power primarily due to a decrease in residential demand mainly from an increase in rooftop solar adoption; offset by
▪$52 million associated with Otay Mesa VIE, which we deconsolidated in August 2019.
Energy-Related Businesses: Revenues and Cost of Sales
The table below shows revenues and cost of sales for our energy-related businesses.
(1) Includes eliminations of intercompany activity.
(2) Excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately on Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In 2021 compared to 2020 revenues from our energy-related businesses, substantially all of which are at Sempra Infrastructure, increased by $521 million (39%) to $1.9 billion primarily due to:
▪$355 million increase in revenues from asset and supply optimization, contracts to sell natural gas to third parties and LNG offtake, including:

▪ $53 million decrease at Parent and other primarily from lower deferred compensation expense and retained operating costs; and
▪ $18 million decrease at Sempra Renewables primarily due to lower general and administrative and other costs due to the wind-down of the business in 2019.
Aliso Canyon Litigation and Regulatory Matters
In 2021, SoCalGas recorded charges of $1,593 million compared to $307 million in 2020 related to civil litigation and regulatory matters pertaining to the Leak. We describe these charges in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impairment Losses
In 2019, SoCalGas recognized a $29 million impairment loss related to non-utility native gas assets. Also in 2019, SDG&E and SoCalGas recognized impairment losses of $6 million and $8 million, respectively, for certain disallowed capital costs in the 2019 GRC FD.
Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets
In 2021, Parent and Other recognized a $36 million gain on the sale of PXiSE, which we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2019, Sempra Renewables recognized a $61 million gain on the sale of its remaining wind assets and investments.
Other Income (Expense), Net
