Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations have been recast from prior periods to reflect the OMP Merger (defined below) as a discontinued operation. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 6-Discontinued Operations.” In addition, the following discussion contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results, and the differences can be material. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this report for an explanation of these types of statements.
For discussion related to changes in financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2021.
Overview
We are an independent E&P company with quality and sustainable long-lived assets in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin. Our mission is to improve lives by safely and responsibly providing affordable, reliable and abundant energy. We are uniquely positioned with a best-in-class balance sheet and are focused on rigorous capital discipline and generating free cash flow by operating efficiently, safely and responsibly to develop our unconventional onshore oil-rich resources in the continental United States.
Recent Developments
Return of Capital Plan
On February 9, 2022, we announced a plan to return $280 million of capital to shareholders over the next year ($70 million per quarter) through a combination of a base dividend (approximately $45 million), variable dividends and share repurchases. This return of capital plan represents a balanced approach that reflects our strategic goals of exercising capital discipline while delivering both return on and return of capital to shareholders. The Board of Directors has increased the quarterly base dividend by 17% from $0.50 per share of common stock to $0.585 per share of common stock and expects to pay an aggregate base dividend of $11.3 million per quarter during 2022. The Board of Directors declared the base dividend for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $0.585 per share of common stock ($2.34 per share annualized) payable on March 4, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2022. In addition, the Board of Directors authorized a new $150.0 million share repurchase program to replace the $100.0 million share repurchase program that was fully utilized in 2021. We expect to return capital proportionately each quarter through 2022. After the end of each quarter, we expect to announce a variable dividend based on $70 million less cash utilized to pay the base dividend and repurchase shares during the prior quarter. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information.
Williston Basin Acquisition
On October 21, 2021, we completed our acquisition of approximately 95,000 net acres in the Williston Basin, effective April 1, 2021, from QEP Energy Company (“QEP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, Inc. for total cash consideration of $585.8 million (the “Williston Basin Acquisition”). The total cash consideration paid was comprised of a deposit of $74.5 million paid on May 3, 2021 and $511.3 million paid at closing on October 21, 2021. The Williston Basin Acquisition was funded with cash on hand, which included proceeds from the Permian Basin Sale (defined below) and the Oasis Senior Notes (defined below).
Permian Basin Sale
On June 29, 2021, we completed the sale of our upstream assets in the Texas region of the Permian Basin, effective March 1, 2021, to Percussion Petroleum Operating II, LLC (“Percussion”) for an aggregate purchase price of $450.0 million (the “Primary Permian Basin Sale”). The purchase price consisted of $375.0 million cash at closing and up to three earn-out payments of $25.0 million per year for each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 if the average daily settlement price of NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (“NYMEX WTI”) crude oil exceeds $60 per barrel for such year (the “Permian Basin Sale Contingent Consideration”). We received cash proceeds of $342.3 million after purchase price adjustments that were primarily related to cash flows from the effective date to the close date. The total consideration remains subject to earn-out payments related to the Permian Basin Sale Contingent Consideration.
In addition to the Primary Permian Basin Sale, we also divested certain wellbore interests in the Texas region of the Permian Basin to separate buyers in the second quarter of 2021 (the “Additional Permian Basin Sale” and together with the Primary
Permian Basin Sale, the “Permian Basin Sale”). We received cash proceeds from the Additional Permian Basin Sale of $30.0 million.
OMP Merger
On October 25, 2021, OMP and OMP GP entered into the OMP Merger pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Crestwood our entire ownership of OMP common units and all of the limited liability company interests of OMP GP in exchange for $160.0 million in cash and approximately 21 million common units representing limited partner interests of Crestwood. The OMP Merger was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both Oasis and Crestwood and was also unanimously approved by the Board of Directors and Conflicts Committee of OMP GP.
The OMP Merger was completed on February 1, 2022 and we own approximately 21.7% of Crestwood’s issued and outstanding common units, and we are Crestwood’s largest single customer. In connection with the closing of the OMP Merger, the Company and Crestwood executed a director nomination agreement pursuant to which we designated two directors to the Board of Directors of Crestwood GP.
The OMP Merger represents a strategic shift for the Company and qualified for reporting as a discontinued operation. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5-Oasis Midstream Partners.”
Change in Chief Executive Officer
On April 13, 2021, Daniel E. Brown was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company. At the same time, Mr. Brown was also appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Brown replaced Douglas E. Brooks, who was previously appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis. Mr. Brooks continues to serve in his role as Board Chair.
Market Conditions and COVID-19
COVID-19 remains a global health crisis and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 and its variants will continue to spread. Despite improvements in global economic activity levels and higher energy demand compared to 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 continue to be unpredictable, including the impacts of new virus strains, the risk of renewed restrictions and the uncertainty of successful administration of effective treatments and vaccines. We are unable to reasonably estimate the period of time that related conditions could exist or the extent to which they could impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Commodity prices have risen from historic lows in 2020; however, further negative impacts from COVID-19 may require us to adjust our business plan.
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities. We have established appropriate policies and procedures while we have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. All managers and supervisors have been trained on how to address positive COVID-19 cases, including procedures on notifying, tracking and communicating COVID-19 cases. Our Crisis Management Team continuously monitors public health data and guidance, engages with peer companies, and participates with industry associations to ensure alignment with guidance for employee health and safety.
In September 2021, President Biden announced a COVID-19 action plan that would have the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) develop an Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) which may include new obligations for employers with one hundred or more employees with respect to vaccinations, testing and paid time off. In November 2021, OSHA published an ETS that requires covered employers to take affirmative steps to address COVID-19 safety, including having a written COVID-19 vaccination policy and having a process in place where employees are able to confidentially submit proof of vaccination status. The ETS also requires any employee who is not fully vaccinated to wear a face covering at the workplace, effective January 20, 2022, and be subject to regular COVID-19 testing, effective February 9, 2022. In connection with the ETS, we established a policy to comply with OSHA’s ETS on vaccination, testing and face coverings that applies to all of our employees. On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the OSHA ETS. We monitor mandates related to COVID-19 at both the federal and state levels on an ongoing basis and continue to assess the potential impacts of those mandates.
Commodity Prices
Our revenue, profitability and ability to return cash to shareholders depend substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments as well as competition from other sources of energy. Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years and may continue to fluctuate widely in the future.
In an effort to improve price realizations from the sale of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, we manage our commodities marketing activities in-house, which enables us to market and sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a broader array of potential purchasers. We enter into crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales contracts with purchasers who have access to transportation capacity, utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our commodity price risk and enter into physical
delivery contracts to manage our price differentials. Due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. Please see “Part I, Item 1. Business-Exploration and Production Operations-Marketing and major customers.”
Our average net realized crude oil prices and average price differentials are shown in the tables below for the periods presented:
__________________
(1)Realized crude oil prices do not include the effect of derivative contract settlements.
(2)Price differential reflects the difference between our realized crude oil prices and NYMEX WTI crude oil index prices.
We sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to multiple pipeline and rail facilities. As of December 31, 2021, 95% of our gross operated crude oil production was connected to gathering systems, which originate at the wellhead and reduce the need to transport barrels by truck from the wellhead. Our market optionality on these crude oil gathering systems allows us to shift volumes between pipeline and rail markets in order to optimize price realizations. Expansions of both rail and pipeline facilities in the Williston Basin has reduced prior constraints on crude oil takeaway capacity and improved our price differentials received at the lease.
Results of Operations
The OMP Merger qualified for reporting as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the results of operations of OMP have been classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). Prior periods have been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the 2021 consolidated financial statements. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 6-Discontinued Operations” for additional information.
In addition, we emerged from bankruptcy on November 19, 2020 (the “Emergence Date”) and adopted fresh start accounting, which resulted in us becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements on or after November 19, 2020 are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements prior to that date. References to “Successor” relate to our financial position and results of operations as of and subsequent to the Emergence Date. References to “Predecessor” relate to our financial position prior to, and our results of operations through and including, the Emergence Date.
Highlights
During the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor):
•Production volumes averaged 58,032 Boepd (64% oil).
•Lease operating expenses were $9.63 per Boe, compared to $9.27 per Boe during the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor) and $7.55 per Boe during the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor).
•E&P and other capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest and acquisition capital, were $168.4 million.
•Estimated net proved reserves were 250.9 MMBoe as of December 31, 2021, with a Standardized Measure of $2.7 billion and PV-10 of $3.1 billion.
•Paid regular cash dividends of $1.625 per share of common stock and a special dividend of $4.00 per share of common stock.
•Completed $100.0 million share repurchase program.
Revenues
Our crude oil and natural gas revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas production. These revenues do not include the effects of derivative instruments and may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices. Our purchased oil and gas sales are primarily derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas purchased through our marketing activities primarily to optimize transportation costs, for blending to meet pipeline specifications or to cover production shortfalls. Revenues and expenses from crude oil and natural gas sales and purchases are recorded on a gross basis when we act as a principal in these transactions by assuming control of the purchased crude oil or natural gas before it is transferred to the customer. In certain cases, we enter into sales and purchases with the same counterparty in contemplation of one another, and these transactions are recorded on a net basis.
Our other services revenues are derived from equipment rentals, and also included revenues for well completion services and product sales prior to our transition of our well fracturing services from Oasis Well Services LLC (“OWS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to a third-party provider during the first quarter of 2020 (the “Well Services Exit”). Substantially all of our other services revenues are from services provided to our operated wells. Intercompany revenues for work performed for our ownership interests are eliminated in consolidation, and only the revenues related to non-affiliated interest owners and other third-party customers are included in other services revenues.
The following table summarizes our revenues for the periods presented (in thousands):
The following table summarizes the changes in production and average realized prices for the periods presented:
__________________
(1)The effect of derivative settlements includes the cash received or paid for the cumulative gains or losses on our commodity derivatives settled in the periods presented, but does not include proceeds from derivative liquidations or payments for derivative modifications. Our commodity derivatives do not qualify for or were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.
(2)Natural gas prices include the value for natural gas and NGLs.
Crude oil and natural gas revenues. Crude oil and natural gas revenues increased $512.6 million, or 75%, in 2021. This increase was attributable to a $676.3 million increase due to higher crude oil and natural gas sales prices, partially offset by a $163.8 million decrease due to lower crude oil and natural gas production sold. During the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), our crude oil and natural gas revenues were positively impacted by higher commodity prices compared to the previous year due largely to higher energy demand as a result of increased economic activity following severe COVID-19 restrictions during 2020. Excluding the effect of derivative settlements, average crude oil sales prices increased 80%, and average natural gas sales prices, which include the value for natural gas and NGLs, increased 209% year over year. Average daily production sold decreased by 6,685 Boepd year over year, primarily driven by a decrease of 5,353 Boepd due to the divestiture of our upstream assets in the Permian Basin on June 29, 2021. We closed the Williston Basin Acquisition on October 21, 2021, and average daily production from the Williston Basin Acquisition asset between the close date to December 31, 2021 was 21,226 Boepd. During the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), we completed and placed on production 22.3 total net operated wells in the Williston Basin.
Purchased oil and gas sales. Purchased oil and gas sales, which consist primarily of the sale of crude oil purchased to optimize transportation costs, for blending to meet pipeline specifications or to cover production shortfalls, increased $121.2 million to $379.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), primarily due to higher crude oil sales prices period over period, partially offset by lower crude oil volumes purchased and then subsequently sold.
Other services revenues. Other services revenues decreased by $6.4 million to $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), which was primarily attributable to a decrease in well completion revenues due to the Well Services Exit in the first quarter of 2020.
Expenses and other income
The following table summarizes our operating expenses, gain (loss) on sale of properties, other income and expenses, income tax benefit, net income (loss) from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations attributable to Oasis, net of income tax and net income (loss) attributable to Oasis for the periods presented (in thousands, except per Boe of production):
Lease operating expenses. Lease operating expenses (“LOE”) increased $21.0 million year over year to $203.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). This increase was due to a $32.0 million increase in the Williston Basin related to higher costs for gas lift of $10.9 million, fixed costs of $10.5 million and workover expenses of $9.3 million. These increases were offset by a decrease of $11.0 million for LOE in the Permian Basin due to the divestiture of those assets in June of 2021. LOE increased $1.91 per Boe to $9.63 per Boe due to a combination of higher costs and lower production volumes.
Other services expenses. The $6.6 million decrease year over year was primarily attributable to a decrease in well completion expenses due to the Well Services Exit in the first quarter of 2020.
Gathering, processing and transportation expenses. Gathering, processing and transportation (“GPT”) expenses decreased $8.5 million year over year, which was attributable to a $3.4 million decrease in natural gas gathering and processing expenses and a $2.2 million decrease in crude oil gathering and transportation expenses, both related to a decrease in our production volumes. In addition, there was a decrease of $2.8 million related to non-cash valuation adjustments for pipeline imbalances. GPT per Boe was $5.79 for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) and increased year over year due to lower production volumes.
Purchased oil and gas expenses. Purchased oil and gas expenses, which represent the crude oil purchased primarily to optimize transportation costs, for blending to meet pipeline specifications or to cover production shortfalls, increased $130.7 million year over year to $380.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) primarily due to higher crude oil prices period over period, partially offset by lower crude oil volumes purchased.
Production taxes. Production taxes increased $25.5 million year over year to $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas revenues. The production tax rate as a percentage of crude oil and natural gas sales was 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021(Successor), compared to 6.9% for the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor) and 7.6% for the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor). The production tax rate decreased year over year primarily due to a lower crude oil production mix in the Williston Basin.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense decreased $158.4 million, or 56%, year over year to $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in DD&A related to oil and gas properties in the Williston Basin of $136.5 million, of which $133.8 million was due to a lower average unit-of-production rate and $2.7 million was due to lower production volumes. In the Williston Basin, the average unit-of-production DD&A rate decreased $6.55 per Boe, or 56%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a lower basis in our oil and gas properties due to write-downs during 2020. In addition, DD&A expense decreased $31.2 million due to a partial year of depletion expense on our Permian Basin properties that were sold in June of 2021. These decreases were offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to our fixed assets of $9.9 million due to a higher book basis in well fracturing equipment as a result of fresh start accounting fair value adjustments made in November 2020.
Rig termination. There were no rig termination expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) or for the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor). We recorded $1.3 million of rig termination expenses for the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor) to early terminate certain drilling rig contracts in the Permian Basin.
Impairment. Impairment expenses were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). There were no impairment expenses for the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor). We recorded impairment expenses of $4.8 billion for the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor), primarily due to the following:
•Proved oil and gas properties. The Predecessor recorded an impairment charge of $4.4 billion on its proved oil and gas properties, including $3.8 billion in the Williston Basin and $637.3 million in the Permian Basin for the period ended November 19, 2020, primarily due to a significant decline in commodity prices.
•Unproved oil and gas properties. The Predecessor recorded impairment losses on its unproved oil and gas properties of $401.1 million for the period ended November 19, 2020 as a result of leases expiring or expected to expire, as well as drilling plan uncertainty on certain acreage of unproved properties.
General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses decreased $78.8 million year over year to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). This decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation expenses due to a 21% decrease in employee headcount year over year, coupled with restructuring related expenses incurred during 2020. Cash G&A, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.18 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), compared to $5.04 per Boe during the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor) and $4.52 per Boe during the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor). For a definition of Cash G&A and a reconciliation of G&A to Cash G&A, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Litigation settlement. There were no litigation settlement expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) or for the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor). During the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor), we recorded a loss accrual of $22.8 million for the remaining settlement of legal proceedings with Mirada Energy, LLC and certain related parties. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies” for more information.
Gain (loss) on sale of properties. For the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), we recognized a $222.8 million net gain on sale of properties primarily related to the Permian Basin Sale. For the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19,
2020 (Predecessor), we recognized a $10.4 million net gain on sale of properties primarily related to the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the Williston Basin. For more information on our divestitures, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 13-Acquisitions and Divestitures”.
Derivative instruments. As a result of entering into derivative contracts and the effect of the forward strip commodity price changes, we recognize gains or losses on our derivative instruments for the change in their fair value during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), we recorded a $589.6 million net loss on derivative instruments, primarily due to an unrealized loss of $319.5 million and a realized loss of $270.1 million. The unrealized loss includes a loss of $331.5 million related to our commodity derivative contracts, partially offset by a gain of $12.0 million related to the Permian Basin Sale Contingent Consideration. The realized loss includes $255.5 million related to settlement payments on crude oil derivative contracts and $14.7 million related to settlement payments on natural gas derivative contracts. During the 2020 Successor Period, we recognized an $84.6 million loss on derivative instruments, including net cash settlement payments of $0.1 million, for the decrease in the fair value of our derivative contracts as a result of an increase in forward commodity prices during the period. During the 2020 Predecessor Period, we recognized a $233.6 million gain on derivative instruments, including net cash settlement receipts of $224.4 million, of which $62.6 million was received for derivative contracts liquidated prior to their maturities.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest. Interest expense decreased $113.1 million year over year to $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). The decrease was primarily due to interest expense related to the Predecessor’s senior unsecured notes of $92.5 million and the Predecessor’s revolving credit facility of $21.0 million that were recorded during the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor), coupled with a specified default interest charge of $30.3 million that was incurred during the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor) and was subsequently waived on the Emergence Date. These decreases were offset by interest expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) related to the Oasis Senior Notes (defined below) of $13.7 million and the Oasis Credit Facility (defined below) of $9.3 million, coupled with a fee of $7.8 million that was incurred to enter into a commitment letter for a senior secured second lien facility. The senior secured second lien facility was terminated prior to being drawn and was replaced with financing from the Oasis Senior Notes (defined below).
For the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), the weighted average debt outstanding under the Oasis Credit Facility (defined below) was $65.5 million, and the weighted average interest rate incurred on outstanding borrowings under the Oasis Credit Facility (defined below) was 4.2%. Interest capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) was $2.1 million.
Gain on extinguishment of debt. There was no extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). During the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor), we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $156.8 million of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate cost of $68.0 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $83.9 million.
Reorganization items, net. During the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor), we recorded $665.9 million of net reorganization items related to our emergence from bankruptcy, consisting of (i) gains on the settlement of obligations under the Predecessor senior unsecured notes, (ii) fresh start accounting fair value adjustments, (iii) professional fees, (iv) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and an unamortized debt discount and (v) fees associated with a debtor-in-possession credit facility. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3-Fresh Start Accounting” for more information on amounts recorded to reorganization items, net.
Income tax benefit. Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) was recorded at (0.3)% of pre-tax income. Our income tax benefit for the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor) and the period from November 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor) was recorded at 6.6% and 7.0% of pre-tax loss, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) was lower than the effective tax rate for the previous year primarily due to the impacts of the change in the valuation allowance, reorganization impacts and the impacts of non-controlling interests.
Income from discontinued operations attributable to Oasis, net of income tax. Income from discontinued operations attributable to Oasis, net of income tax decreased $112.1 million year over year to $130.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor). The decrease was primarily due to $120.9 million of reorganization items recorded during the period from January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 (Predecessor) related to our emergence from bankruptcy, consisting of (i) fresh start accounting adjustments of $92.9 million and (ii) reorganization adjustments of $28.0 million. This decrease was coupled with higher midstream expenses of $68.5 million due to an increase in natural gas purchase costs and higher depreciation expense of $9.5 million, offset by higher midstream revenues of $61.6 million due to an increase in natural gas revenues and higher intercompany eliminations for LOE and GPT of $29.2 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity during the period covered by this report have been cash flows from operations, proceeds from the Permian Basin Sale, the issuance of the Oasis Senior Notes and OMP Senior Notes and proceeds from the OMP Equity Offering. Our primary uses of cash have been for net principal payments under the OMP Credit Facility (defined below), payments for derivative settlements and modifications, acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, interest payments on our long-term debt, dividends paid to our shareholders, payments to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program and distributions to non-controlling interests. Upon closing of the OMP Merger on February 1, 2022, the OMP Senior Notes (defined below) were assumed by Crestwood and the OMP Credit Facility (defined below) was paid in full by Crestwood. In addition, following the OMP Merger, we will no longer make distributions to non-controlling interests, which represented the minority interest ownership of OMP. Crestwood has historically declared cash distributions to its common unitholders, and we expect to receive cash distributions from Crestwood of approximately $54 million in 2022.
We have announced a plan to return $280 million of capital to shareholders over the next year (approximately $70 million per quarter) through a combination of a base dividend (approximately $45 million), variable dividends and share repurchases. This return of capital plan represents a balanced approach that reflects our strategic goals of exercising capital discipline while delivering both return on and return of capital to shareholders. The Board of Directors has increased the quarterly base dividend by 17% from $0.50 per share of common stock to $0.585 per share of common stock and expects to pay an aggregate base dividend of $11.3 million per quarter during 2022. We expect to return capital proportionately each quarter through 2022. After the end of each quarter, we expect to announce a variable dividend based on $70 million less cash utilized to pay the base dividend and repurchase shares during the prior quarter.
Our cash flows depend on many factors, including the price of crude oil and natural gas and the success of our development and exploration activities as well as future acquisitions. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by executing derivative transactions to mitigate the change in crude oil and natural gas prices on our production, thereby mitigating our exposure to crude oil and natural gas price declines, but these transactions may also limit our cash flow in periods of rising crude oil and natural gas prices. During 2021, we entered into a series of transactions with derivative counterparties to modify the strike price of certain crude oil swap contracts.
