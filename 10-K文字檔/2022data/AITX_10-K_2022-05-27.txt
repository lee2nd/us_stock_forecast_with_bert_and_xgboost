Results of Operations
The following table shows our results of operations for the years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021. The historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
The following table presents revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by product/service:
Revenue
Total revenue for the year ended February 28, 2022 was $1.447,109, which represented an increase of $1,086,221 compared to total revenue of $360,888 for the year ended February 28, 2021. This large increase in direct sales totaling $798,114 is a result of unit sales which includes sales of new units totaling $688,180 with the remaining increase a result in higher training revenue. Rental activities increased by 95% as the Company continues to grow its product line and customer base.
Gross profit
Total gross profit for the year ended February 28, 2022 was $974,183, which represented an increase of $711,462 compared to total gross profit of $262,721 for the year ended February 28, 2021. The increase is a result of the increase in revenues above , partially offset by the increase in the relatively lower margin direct sales.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses for the years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021 comprised of the following:
Our operating expenses were comprised of general and administrative expenses, research and development, depreciation and amortization, and a (gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional services, automobile expenses, advertising, salaries and wages, travel expenses and rent. Our operating expenses during the years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021 were $14,346,069 and $3,257,590, respectively. The overall $11,088,479 increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the following increases in operating expenses of:
- 24 -
● Research and development expenses increased by $2,583,158 which was due funding development of new products,(such as the ROAMEO, AVA , and TOM ) as well as upgrades of existing products.
● General and administrative expenses increased by $8,156,635 primarily due to the following increases:
- Stock based compensation to CEO in equity awards was $2,048,850 fees with $109,200 paid to consultants all totaling $2,158,050 for the year ended February 28, 2022, compared with stock based compensation paid to lenders and consultants $362,084 for the prior year. This represents an increase of $1,795,966 in stock based compensation.
- Professional fees increased by $757,466 due to increases in financial reporting of $171,384, increase in legal of $200,993 with the remaining increase due increases in regulatory, investor relations and consulting costs.
- Wages, salaries and payroll levies increased by $2,578,216 as a result of the hiring of more staff to operate the new manufacturing facility. This is partially offset by a decrease in subcontractors of $200,381 due to employees now performing many of those tasks. Additionally, base compensation (including payroll levies) to the CEO increased by $33,620 with an addition bonus paid of $1,429,328.
- Advertising and marketing costs increased by $131,157 as the Company began efforts to promote its products.
- Supplies increased by approximately $104,953 through their use in new prototypes and designs.
- Trade shows and travel increased by $325,937 as a result of promotional and business travel in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021 there were travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, so the charges that year were minimal.
- The remaining increases were distributed amongst other general and administrative accounts such a software costs, freight, office expenses, insurance , repairs and maintenance, and utilities amongst others. In general, these large increases in general and administrative expenses may be explained due to the large ramp up in costs this fiscal year to operate the new manufacturing facility and the hiring of 18 additional full-time employees. In addition, the expenses of the prior year’s corresponding period were also much lower due to the Covid 19 pandemic and the limited cash that was available at that time.
● Operating lease cost and rent increased by $266,324 due to the new operating lease for the new manufacturing facility.
● Depreciation and amortization increased by $112,040 due to the increase in revenue earning devices and the new vehicle in fixed assets.
● (Gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets increased by $29,678 due to a vehicle disposal in 2022 that yielded a gain.
Other income (expense)
Other income (expense) consisted of the change of fair value of derivative instruments interest expense and gain on settlement of debt. Other income (expense) during the years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, was ($48,825,598) and ($2,904,042), respectively.
The change in other income (expense) was due to the following:
● Change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $391,811 due to the re-valuation of derivative liability on convertible notes based on the change in the market price of the Company’s common stock and the decrease in convertible notes payable through debt conversions to common stock and settlements.
● Interest expense increased by $12,749,666 due to an aggregate increase in short and long term debt of approximately $13 million in fiscal 2022. For the year ended February 28, 2022, interest expense related to the issuance of warrants for debt extensions was $5,415,000 (2021-$0) and amortization of debt discounts was $7,597,242 (2021-$201,567).
● Loss on settlement of debt increased by $32,780,079 due to the fiscal 2022 valuation of Series F shares and warrants given in exchange for an amendment to a deferred variable payment obligation disclosed in Note 7 that resulted in a loss of $33,015,215. The difference can be attributed to smaller gains and losses on other debt settlements.
- 25 -
The Company’s loss from operations for the year ended February 28, 2022 was $13,371,886, which represented an increase in loss of $10,377,017 compared to a loss of $2,994,869 for the year ended February 28, 2021. The higher revenues in 2022 were offset by significantly higher operating expenses for the reasons set out above. Note that the Company had a net loss of $62,197,484 for the year ended February 28, 2022 as compared to net loss of $5,898,911 for the year ended February 28, 2021. This change is mostly attributable to the loss on settlement of debt, increase in interest expense and an increase in general and administrative costs.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
For the year ended February 28, 2022, the Company had negative cash flow from operating activities of $14,825,442. As of February 28, 2022 the Company has an accumulated deficit of $94,144,254 and working capital of $2,502,718. Management does not anticipate having positive cash flow from operations in the near future. These factors raise a substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.
The Company does not have the resources at this time to repay all its credit and debt obligations, make any payments in the form of dividends to its shareholders or fully implement its business plan. Without additional capital, the Company will not be able to remain in business.
Management has plans to address the Company’s financial situation as follows:
The company began raising money through it’s S-3 this year and made improvements in paying off debt, investing in inventory and at February 28, 2022 had $4.6 million of cash on hard. Management is committed to raise either non-dilutive funds or minimally dilutive funds. There is no assurance that these funds will be able to be raised nor can we provide assurance that these possible raises may not have dilutive effects. The Company through to February 28, 2022 has raised approximately $12.5 million net of issuance costs through the sale of its common shares and $9.4 in proceeds from debt issuances.
The Company plans to improve the trading market for its shares by uplisting the shares to the OTCQB during the next fiscal year.
Capital Resources
The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital for the period indicated:
__________
(1) As February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, current liabilities included approximately $7,587 and $444,666, respectively, of derivative liabilities that are expected to be settled in shares of the Company in accordance with the various conversion terms.
As of February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, we had a cash balance of $4,648,146 and $1,044,418, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency forward contracts. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
In order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States, management must make estimates , judgements and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and determine whether contingent assets and liabilities, if any , are disclosed in the financial statements. The ultimate resolution of issues requiring these estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from resolution currently anticipated by management and on which the financial statements are based. The most significant estimates included in these consolidated financial statements are those associated with the assumptions used to value derivative liabilities.
Revenue Earning Devices
Revenue earning devices are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 48 months. The Company continually evaluates revenue earning devices to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life or whether the devices should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses a combination of the undiscounted cash flows and market approaches in assessing whether an asset has been impaired. The Company measures impairment losses based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value.
- 27 -
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets which range from three to five years. Major repairs or improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements and maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend asset lives are expensed currently.
The Company periodically evaluates the fair value of fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Upon retirement or other disposition of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in income.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development unless they meet specific criteria related to technical, market and financial feasibility, as determined by Management, including but not limited to the establishment of a clearly defined future market for the product, and the availability of adequate resources to complete the project. If all criteria are met, the costs are deferred and amortized over the expected useful life or written off if a product is abandoned. At February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, the Company had no deferred development costs.
Sales of Future Revenues
The Company has entered into transactions, as more fully described in footnote 11, in which it has received funding from investors in exchange for which it will make payments to those investors based on the level of sales of certain revenue categories, generally based on a percentage of sales for those certain revenues. The Company determines whether these agreements constitute sales of future revenues or are in substance debt based on the facts and circumstances of each agreement, with the following primary criteria determinative of whether the agreement constitutes a sale of future revenues or debt:
● Does the agreement purport, in substance, to be a sale
● Does the Company have continuing involvement in the generation of cash flows due the investor
● Is the transaction cancellable by either party through payment of a lump sum or other transfer of assets
● Is the investors rate of return implicitly limited by the terms of the agreement
● Does the Company’s revenue for a reporting period underlying the agreement have only a minimal impact on the investor’s rate of return
● Does the investor have recourse relating to payments due
In the event a transaction is determined to be a sale of future revenues, it is recorded as deferred revenue and amortized using the sum-of-the-revenue method. In the event a transaction is determined to be debt, it is recorded as debt and amortized using the effective interest method. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company has determined that all such agreements are debt.
Revenue Recognition
ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”, supersedes the revenue recognition requirements and industry specific guidance under Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process that must be evaluated and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The Company adopted Topic 606 on March 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Under the modified retrospective method, prior period financial positions and results will not be adjusted. There was no cumulative effect adjustment recognized as a result of this adoption. While the Company does not expect fiscal year 2020 net earnings to be materially impacted by revenue recognition timing changes, Topic 606 requires certain changes to the presentation of revenues and related expenses beginning March 1, 2018. Refer to Note 3 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information.

Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
The Company relies on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, to classify certain redeemable and/or convertible instruments. The Company first determines whether a financial instrument should be classified as a liability. The Company will determine the liability classification if the financial instrument is mandatorily redeemable, or if the financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, embodies a conditional obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares.
Once the Company determines that a financial instrument should not be classified as a liability, the Company determines whether the financial instrument should be presented between the liability section and the equity section of the balance sheet (“temporary equity”). The Company will determine temporary equity classification if the redemption of the financial instrument is outside the control of the Company (i.e. at the option of the holder). Otherwise, the Company accounts for the financial instrument as permanent equity.
Our CEO and Chairman holds sufficient shares of the Company’s voting stock that give sufficient voting rights under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company such that the CEO and Chairman can at any time unilaterally vote to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company without the need to call a general meeting of common shareholders of the Company
Initial Measurement
The Company records its financial instruments classified as liability, temporary equity or permanent equity at issuance at the fair value, or cash received.
Subsequent Measurement - Financial Instruments Classified as Liabilities
The Company records the fair value of its financial instruments classified as liabilities at each subsequent measurement date. The changes in fair value of its financial instruments classified as liabilities are recorded as other income (expenses).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC Topic 820”) provides a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:
● Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
● Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
● Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.

Measured on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents information about our liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fell:
See Note 12 for specific inputs used in determining fair value.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and advances, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Earnings (Loss) per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS give effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and/or warrants. Diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Basic loss per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed in a manner similar to the basic loss per share, except the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to include all common shares, including those with the potential to be issued by virtue of convertible debt and other such convertible instruments. Diluted loss per share contemplates a complete conversion to common shares of all convertible instruments only if they are dilutive in nature with regards to earnings per share.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 was issued to provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified retrospective adoption method. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The standard did not materially impact our consolidated net loss, accumulated deficit, and had no impact on cash flows. The Company has adopted this on March 1, 2020.
