ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. A discussion of changes in our results of operations from 2019 to 2020 may be found in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 9, 2021. Further, we encourage you to revisit the Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report.
Executive Summary
We have continued to invest in infrastructure to support anticipated future growth in each area that is key to our performance, including personnel, technology and processes in order to meet the increasing compliance obligations of the financial services industry. We believe we are well-positioned in high-growth markets in which we operate and will continue to focus on margin improvement, leveraging capital, organic portfolio loan growth and operating efficiency. We believe the key challenge for us in the future is to expand our lending platform and utilize the increase in our low cost deposits, while continuing to manage asset quality, as well as management of compliance in emerging and fast growing markets. We are expanding the Bank's treasury services function to support the banking needs of financial and emerging technology companies, which we believe will further enhance core deposits, notably through the expansion of deposit acquisition and fee income strategies through the Fintech division. During 2020 and into 2021, we entered into agreements for debit card program sponsorship to further enhance fee income and noninterest income. In addition, we continue to expand into the Fintech industry through the acquisition of technology, including a software development team, in order to scale and diversify our banking capabilities.
Financial Results
Net interest income increased $8.3 million, noninterest income decreased $29.2 million and noninterest expense increased $0.3 million during 2021 compared to 2020. Our yield on earning assets (tax-equivalent) in 2021 was 3.52% compared to 4.17% in 2020. Total loans increased by $416.1 million to $1.87 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $1.45 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.44% in 2021 compared to 0.85% in 2020. The decrease in earning assets yield, partially offset by the decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, resulted in a decrease in our net interest margin (tax-equivalent) to 3.26% in 2021 from 3.57% in 2020.
We earned $39.1 million in 2021 compared to $37.4 million in 2020, an increase of $1.7 million. The 2021 earnings equated to a return on average assets of 1.5% and a return on average equity of 15.6%, compared to 2020 results of 1.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.32 and $3.10, respectively, in 2021 compared to $3.13 and $3.06, respectively, in 2020.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a great degree of uncertainty to both the global and domestic economy and financial markets. The full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and continues to evolve. Financial markets adjusted dramatically to the reduced economic activity and the pace of recovery is uncertain. The financial market benchmark most relevant to our current and future profitability is the United States Government Treasury yield curve. The United States Government Treasury yield curve is used as a basis for pricing most bonds, loans, borrowings, deposits and other fixed income yield curves. The United States Government Treasury yield curve has experienced a large, relatively parallel, downward shift. Given our current asset-sensitive position, management expects continued pressure on net interest income. As the outlook for the COVID-19 pandemic improves, management expects that the United States Government Treasury curve will experience some degree of an upward shift over time.
We actively participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), and may evaluate other programs available to assist our clients and provide consumer deferrals consistent with government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) guidelines. Management is working to incorporate scenarios that reflect decreased loan cash flows in the short term into our interest rate risk models.
There was considerable demand for the PPP implemented by the CARES Act to combat the economic slowdown brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP was created to provide funding to small business owners who may have had to temporarily close or scale back production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intended use of this funding is to pay employees who may be temporarily unable to work. The original tranche of PPP funding of $349 billion ran out 13 days after the program's implementation. The second tranche of PPP funding of $310 billion had funds available as of the program's closure date. On July
2, 2020, additional legislation was passed that allowed small businesses to apply for loans through August 8, 2020. On January 8, 2021, the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) announced that the PPP would reopen on January 11, 2021 for new borrowers and certain existing PPP borrowers. During the latest round, funds totaling $284 billion were authorized through March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we originated 734 PPP loans with outstanding balances of $18.0 million through our internal commercial team and originated 3,731 PPP loans with outstanding balances of $113.7 million through our partnership with a Fintech company.
As of December 31, 2021, mortgage loans totaling $2.1 million were outstanding for modifications, such as interest-only payments and payment deferrals. There were no commercial loan modifications outstanding as of December 31, 2021. These modifications were not considered to be troubled debt restructurings in reliance on guidance issued by banking regulators titled the “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.”
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin (Average Balance Schedules)
The following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about (1) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (2) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (3) the interest rate spread; (4) net interest income and margin; and (5) net interest income and margin (on a tax-equivalent basis). The average balances presented are derived from daily average balances.
Average Balances and Analysis of Net Interest Income
1 Non-accrual loans are included in total loan balances, lowering the effective yield for the portfolio in the aggregate.
2 In order to make pre-tax income and resultant yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to those on taxable loans and investment securities, a tax-equivalent adjustment has been computed using a Federal tax rate of 21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measure following this table.
3 Our PPP loans, totaling $131.7 million and $82.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in this amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Rate Volume Calculation
The year over year change in rate volume to 2021 from 2020 is as follows:
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, which is the primary source of revenue for the Bank, is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans and investment securities, as well as interest-bearing deposits and certificates of deposit in banks. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, borrowed funds, such as sweep accounts and repurchase agreements, and subordinated debt. Net interest income is also impacted by changes in market interest rates, as well as the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Net interest income is impacted favorably by increases in noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity.
Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and serves as a measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the Bank’s balance sheet. Net interest margin (tax equivalent) was 3.26% in 2021 compared to 3.57% in 2020. The net interest margin continues to face considerable pressure due to falling interest rates and competitive pricing of loans and deposits in the Bank’s markets. During 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate from a range of 1.50% to 1.75% to a range of -% to 0.25% and remained at this range as of 2021. Management’s estimate of the impact of future changes in market interest rates is shown in the section captioned Interest Rate Risk, in
