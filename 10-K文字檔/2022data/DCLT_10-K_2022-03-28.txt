Our decrease in gross margin was due a combination of our increased costs associated with our increased revenue and the loss of economies of scale regarding cost of goods sold.
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 37.3 % for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 34.6 % for the year ended December 31, 2020. As we gain more customers and enter into more service agreements, we anticipate our cost of sales will decrease as we expect to take advantage of applicable economies of scale.

The decrease in expenses for the year of 2021 was due to the Company’s ongoing efforts to expand its operations in the most cost effective and efficient means while reducing costs and the cost of stock issued. We had net income of $15,786. The net income was the due to the Company’s efforts to reduce its long-term debt which was accomplished in 2021.
