Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation
This periodic report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the Plan of Operations provided below, including information regarding the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities, and the plans and objectives of management. The statements made as part of the Plan of Operations that are not historical facts are hereby identified as “forward-looking statements.”
The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in this report as Part II, Item 8.
Critical Accounting Policies
Reflect Scientific’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Reflect Scientific believes that the following addresses Reflect Scientific’s most critical accounting policies. The significant accounting change implemented during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the adoption of lease accounting.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: We sell our specialty science and environmental lab supplies through direct sales and through distributor relationships. We sell our ultra-low temperature freezers through consultants and commission-only sales personnel. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these goods. This core principle is achieved through the following steps:
Identify the contract with the customer. A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We do not have significant costs to obtain contracts with customers.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Generally, our contracts with our laboratory supply customers do not include multiple performance obligations to be completed over a period of time. Our performance obligations generally relate to delivering specialty laboratory products to a customer, subject to the shipping terms of the contract. Limited warranties are provided, under which we typically accept returns and provide either replacement parts or refunds. We do not have significant returns. We do not typically offer extended warranty or service plans.
Ultra-low temperature freezers sold to customers are built to order. Generally, 50% of the value of the contract is paid by the customer prior to work beginning on manufacturing the freezer. Upon completion of manufacturing and testing the customer will then sign an acceptance of the unit and make payment of the remaining balance on the contract, at which title passes to the customer. The units are FOB ship point. The customer may either arrange to transport the unit with a carrier he uses or ask the Company to arrange such shipment, the charges of which are the responsibility of the customer. A customer may, after accepting the unit, request that it be upgraded with additional hardware or software options. Those options are installed under a new contract, with the deposit and final payment requirements being the same as on the original order.
Determine the transaction price. Payment by the customer is due under customary fixed payment terms, and we evaluate if collectability is reasonably assured. None of our contracts as of December 31, 2021 contained a significant financing component.
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. We typically do not have multiple performance obligations in our laboratory supply contracts with customers. As such, we generally recognize revenue upon transfer of the product to the customer’s control at contractually stated pricing. The freezers likewise do not have milestone or percentage of completion clauses in the contract, so revenue is only recognized when the work has been completed.
Contract Balances We have elected to use the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 (regarding recognition of the incremental costs of obtaining a contact) for costs related to contracts that are estimated to be completed within one year. In other word, we do not have any material accrued contract costs; however, we do require customer deposits to be made on freezer purchases. As of December 31, 2021, we have $118,566 of contract liabilities related to these customer deposits and no contract assets.
Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. We generally satisfy performance obligations at a point in time upon shipment of goods, or, with our freezers, upon final acceptance of the unit by the customer, in accordance with the terms of each contract with the customer. We do not have significant service revenue.
ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH: The Company considers all deposit accounts and investment accounts with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: The Company writes off trade receivables when deemed uncollectible. The Company estimates allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aged receivable balances and historical losses. The Company charges off uncollectible accounts when management determines there is no possibility of collecting the related receivable. The Company considers accounts receivable to be past due or delinquent based on contractual terms, which is generally net 30 days.
The Company charged $0 and $0 to bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has historically experienced minimal bad debts. The allowance for doubtful accounts balance of $4,000 at December 31, 2020 was reviewed and it was deemed that no adjustment to the provision was required at December 31, 2021. Management feels this to be an adequate reserve based on the experience seen over multiple years.
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses arising from customers’ inability to make required payments. If there is deterioration of our customers’ credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditure for minor repairs, maintenance, and replacement parts which do not increase the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred. All major additions and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The lives over which the property and equipment are depreciated range from 5 to 7 years, except for computer equipment, which is depreciated over a 3-year life.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value based upon the average cost inventory method. The Company’s inventory consists of parts for scientific vial kits, refrigerant gases, components for the imaging and inspection systems which it builds, and other scientific items.
COST OF SALES: Charges to cost of sales are made on a first-in first-out method (FIFO). In addition to the component costs, some labor costs are allocated to cost of goods for the direct labor utilized to build the sub-assemblies and finished goods.
INCOME TAXES: We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Codification (ASC) 740, “Income Taxes”. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION: The Company, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, records all share-based payments to employees at the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued. In accordance with ASC 718-10-30-9, Measurement Objective - Fair Value at Grant Date, the Company uses the closing price of the stock, as quoted by NASDAQ, on the date of the grant. The Company believes this pricing method provides the best estimate of fair the fair value of the consideration given. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period.
The Company, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, establishes the value of equity instruments issued to non-employees for goods and services by using the closing price of the stock, as quoted by NASDAQ, on the date of the grant. The Company believes this method fairly establishes the value of the goods and/or services received.
GOODWILL: Goodwill represents the excess of the JMST assets acquired over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment, at a reporting unit level, annually and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. The Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis, as of the end of the fourth quarter, and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, business trends and market conditions. Accordingly, the Company recorded on impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
As the Company consists of only one reporting unit, and is publicly traded, management estimates the fair value of its reporting unit utilizing the Company’s market capitalization, multiplying the number of actual shares outstanding by the market price on December 31, as reflected on NASDAQ National Market
LEASES: In February of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), which significantly amends the way companies are required to account for leases. Under the updated leasing guidance, some leases that did not have to be reported previously are now required to be presented as an asset and liability on the balance sheet. In addition, for certain leases, what was previously classified as an operating expense must now be allocated between amortization expense and interest expense. The Company adopted this update as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method.
Overview
During the year ended December 31, 2021 revenue increased by 1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The revenue growth resulted from a small increase in our specialty laboratory supplies, offset in part by an approximately $40,282 decline in sales of our chillers and freezers. While there can be no assurance that freezer sales will increase in future periods, it is encouraging that the marketplace has embraced our disruptive technology, and our installed operating base continues to increase. Historically, the core business of the company has been the sale of specialty laboratory supplies. Orders of those supplies increased as a group in 2021 as compared to 2020. We continue working to attract new distributors to build sales of these specialty items to historical levels.
The recent COVID-19 Pandemic (“the Pandemic”) has to date had little negative effect on our business with regard to disruption of normal business activities such as receiving and processing orders and shipping. Many of the new COVID-19 vaccines and protein-based therapeutics require freezers either in processing or storing these products. The press surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines has often focused on the dearth of freezers capable of storing vaccines at an appropriately low temperature. The Company sells ultra low temperature freezers and as a consequence benefited from the press-generated awareness of the need for these types of freezers. Our pharmaceutical freezer customers develop and manufacture many vaccines. The Company is not privy to the specific use of its low temperature freezers and cannot determine if any increases in sales or revenue are directly attributable to the Pandemic.
There is a continued risk of supply chain interruption, availability of raw materials or other unforeseen issues that can be caused by the ever-changing progression of the Pandemic. In addition, demand for the Company’s products may decrease or fluctuate in the future and current demand for our products may not, therefore, be indicative of sales and revenue going forward.
We recognize these risks and are taking every effort to prevent or mitigate them as they arise.
The Company focused its resources during 2021 to the marketing of our ultra-cold freezers. Increasing sales of the ultra-low temperature freezers and commercialization of the refrigerated trailer will provide opportunity for the Company to expand sales in the higher margin technology markets.
The Company has been proactive in making those business decisions which it believes will enable it to carry out its business plan. Significant cost reduction measures have been implemented, unprofitable subsidiaries divested, facilities consolidated and personnel reductions made.

Net income $ 939,065
$ 660,115 $ 278,950
Total revenue in 2021 increased 0.8% to $2,814,670 from revenue of $2,792,627 in 2020. Revenue of $1,910,179 was from ultra-low temperature freezers accounts in 2021, compared with revenue of $1,950,462 from freezer sales in 2020. We continue to work to increase sales of these freezer units, as well as working to develop marketing strategies to expand distribution channels of our specialty laboratory products.
Our cost of goods sold decreased by $187,225 in the period ending December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020. Gross sales margin was 69% in 2021 and 62% in 2020. Our gross margin percent is influenced by the sales mix, with the ultra-low temperature freezers carrying significantly higher margins than the more generic lab supplies. We are working to further increase gross margins through working with current vendors to obtain more favorable costing or identifying and qualifying new vendors who offer more favorable pricing without compromising quality.
The salaries and wages increase of $73,540 in 2021 compared to 2020 is the net result of salary changes and personnel additions, offset in part by salaries charged to research and development, cost of goods and inventory. Our plan is to continue to use outside contractors where practical to enable us to minimize our number of employees.
Research and development expense was $58,340 in 2021 compared to $185,295 in 2020, a decrease of $126,955. The decrease was due to additional costs incurred in finalizing the design of the ultra-low temperature freezers during 2020, not incurred in 2021.
General and administrative expenses increased to $436,399 for 2021 as compared $350,477 in 2020, an increase of $85,922. The majority of the increase results from increased personnel costs and consulting fees in 2021 over 2020. Expense levels going forward are expected to approximate the 2021 levels as we continue increase market penetration with our products.
Other income consisted in 2021 of a $111,265 gain on forgiveness of our PPP loan.
We had a net income of $939,065 in 2021, an increase of $278,950 over the $660,115 net income realized in 2020.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
We do not believe our business is cyclical.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash resources at December 31, 2021, were $1,473,924, with accounts receivable of $175,649 and inventory of $624,486 net of reserves. Our working capital at December 31, 2021 was $2,063,516. This compares to working capital of $1,203,080 at December 31, 2020.
In 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $831,382 as compared to net cash used by operations of $25,218 in 2020. We anticipate that in 2022, with the benefit of continued cost reductions and increased revenue, we will continue to generate positive cash from operating activities. We continue working to enhance our on-line ordering system to increase sales, develop the market for our ultra-low temperature freezers, work with current vendors to obtain more favorable pricing, and locate new vendors to provide opportunities to further reduce our cost of goods.
We will continue to focus our efforts on our core business activities while pursuing capital resources and evaluating potential future acquisitions which fit within and enhance our core business.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
