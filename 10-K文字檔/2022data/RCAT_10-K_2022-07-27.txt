Recent Developments
Red Cat Holdings has recently completed a series of acquisitions and financings which have broadened the scope of its activities in the drone industry. These developments include:
• In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings, which sells consumer electronics products to the first-person view (“FPV”) sector of the drone industry. Fat Shark’s flagship products are headsets with a built in display (or “goggles”) that allow a pilot to see a real-time video feed from a camera mounted on an aerial platform. The total purchase price was $8.4 million.
• In May 2021, the Company closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “Underwritten Offering”) resulting in the sale of 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per share to underwriters, ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc. (“ThinkEquity”), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-253491), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), which was declared effective on April 29, 2021. The financing generated gross proceeds of $16.0 million and net proceeds of $14.6 million.
• In May 2021, we acquired Skypersonic, Inc., a provider of drone products and software solutions that enable drone inspection flights that can be executed by pilots anywhere in the world. Skypersonic powers drones to “Fly Anywhere” and “Inspect the Impossible”. Its patented software and hardware solutions allow for inspection services in restricted spaces where GPS is not allowed or available. The total purchase price was $2.8 million.
• In July 2021, the Company closed an Underwritten Offering resulting in the sale of 13,333,334 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.50 per share to ThinkEquity. The shares of Common Stock were offered by the Company pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-256216), filed with the Commission which was declared effective on June 14, 2021 (the “Registration Statement”). The financing generated gross proceeds of $60.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $55.5 million.
• In August 2021, we closed the acquisition of Teal Drones ("Teal"), a leader in commercial and government unmanned aerial vehicle ("UAV") technology. Teal manufactures the Golden Eagle, one of only five drones approved by the U.S. Department of Defense for reconnaissance, public safety, and inspection applications. The total purchase price was $14 million.
Business Strategy
Red Cat remains focused on building a portfolio of complementary products and services to support the continued growth and maturation of the drone industry in both the enterprise and consumer market segments. Our disciplined acquisition strategy targets companies with advanced product offerings and unique drone platforms and intellectual property. After the integration of Teal Drones, we would expect government customers including defense, public safety, and infrastructure to be our most significant revenue drivers in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2023.
During the second half of the fiscal year ending on April 30, 2022, the Company focused on integrating and organizing its acquired businesses. These efforts including refining the establishment of Enterprise and Consumer segments in order to sharpen the Company's focus on the unique opportunities in each sector of the drone industry. The Enterprise segment is focused on opportunities in the commercial sector, including the military. Enterprise is building the infrastructure to manage drone fleets, fly and provide services remotely, and navigate confined interior spaces and dangerous military environments. The Consumer segment is focused on enthusiasts and hobbyists which are expected to increase as drones become more visible in our daily lives. Consumer provides a growing revenue base, strong brand visibility for the Company, and is an excellent source of professional pilots.
Results of Operations
When evaluating its operating results, the Company categorizes its functional expenses into sub-categories that capture the essence of the hundreds of general ledger accounts that it maintains. The Company believes this process enables a more insightful understanding of changes in its operating expenses. Cost of Goods is categorized into (i) materials, (ii) labor, (iii) overhead, and (iv) freight. Operations includes (i) payroll and (ii) overhead. Research and development is categorized into (i) payroll, (ii) materials, and (iii) overhead. Sales and marketing includes (i) payroll, (ii) advertising programs, and (iii) third party services. General and administrative is categorized into (i) payroll, (ii) facilities, (iii) professional services, (iv) public company, (v) office, and (vi) insurance and related.
During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”), the Company completed the acquisitions of Teal Drones and Skypersonic which effectively doubled the number of operating subsidiaries. These transactions were the primary reason that the Company’s operating expenses increased to $13,927,801 in Fiscal 2022 compared to $5,946,295 in Fiscal 2021 (the fiscal year ending April 30, 2021) representing an increase of $7,981,506, or 134%. During Fiscal 2022, employee headcount increased from 16 at the beginning of the year to 62 on April 30, 2022. This increase includes the addition of 15 and 10 employees from Teal and Skypersonic, respectively, that now work for the Company. Since acquiring Teal, its headcount has doubled from 15 to 30 in connection with its expanded operations. In addition, we have hired 6 employees to form an internal sales team primarily focused on our Enterprise segment.
Year Ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021
Revenue
During the year ended April 30, 2022 (or the “2022 period”), we generated revenues totaling $6,428,963 compared to revenues totaling $4,999,517 during the year ended April 30, 2021 (or the “2021 period”) representing an increase of $1,429,446 or 29%. Rotor Riot and Fat Shark revenues comprise the entire amount for the 2021 period. During fiscal year 2022, we acquired two additional drone technology companies: Skypersonic and Teal. The increase in revenue during the 2022 period is directly related to the acquisitions. The increase is partially offset by a decrease in both Rotor Riot and Fat Shark revenues of 8% and 9%, respectively. The decreased sales for Fat Shark primarily related to its primary product being at the end of its sales cycle. Fat Shark released its next generation product in June 2022.
Cost of Goods Sold
During the year ended April 30, 2022, we incurred cost of goods sold of $5,503,448 compared to $3,929,832 during the year ended April 30, 2021 resulting in an increase of $1,573,616 or 40%. The higher dollar amount relates to the increase in revenues, primarily related to the acquisitions of Skypersonic and Teal.
Gross Margin

Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, totaled 14% in Fiscal 2022 compared to 21% in Fiscal 2021. The lower level of gross margin was primarily related to Teal whose gross margin of 19% was lower than the consolidated gross margin. In addition, the gross margin of Fat Shark decreased from 18% to 2% due to pricing discounts associated with the sales of products at the end of their life cycles.

In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, if required, will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. Significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) determine stock based compensation, (ii) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, and (iii) accounting for derivatives
Goodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date becomes known, not to exceed 12 months. Adjustments in a purchase price allocation may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.
Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures
The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:
Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
Level 2: Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.
Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
The Company's financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Convertible Securities and Derivatives
When the Company issues convertible debt or equity instruments that contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds from the convertible host instruments are first allocated to the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the convertible instruments themselves, resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value but no lower than zero. Any excess amount is recognized as a derivative expense.
Derivative Liabilities
The Company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change.
In October 2020 and January 2021, the Company entered into convertible note agreements which included provisions under which the conversion price was equal to the lesser of an initial stated amount or the conversion price of a future offering. This variable conversion feature was recognized as a derivative. Both financings included the issuance of warrants which contained similar variable conversion features. The Company values these convertible notes and warrants using the multinomial lattice method that values the derivative liability based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The resulting liability is valued at each reporting date and the change in the liability is reflected as change in derivative liability in the statement of operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
