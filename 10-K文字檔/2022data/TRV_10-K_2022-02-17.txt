CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW
Consolidated Results of Operations
The following discussions of the Company’s net income and segment income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.
Overview
Diluted net income per share of $14.49 in 2021 increased by 38% over diluted net income per share of $10.52 in 2020. Net income of $3.66 billion in 2021 increased by 36% over net income of $2.70 billion in 2020. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher net investment income, (ii) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying underwriting margins"), (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iv) higher net realized investment gains, partially offset by (v) higher catastrophe losses (net of recoveries under the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties). Catastrophe losses in 2021 and 2020 were $1.85 billion and $1.61 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2021 and 2020 was $538 million and $351 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins in 2021 were driven by Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance, partially offset by Personal Insurance. Underlying underwriting margins in 2021 and 2020 reflected a net favorable impact from COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Income tax expense in 2021 was higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the increase in income before income taxes.
For discussion regarding the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company, see "Outlook" and "Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors."
The Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd’s, as well as in Brazil and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company’s net income or segment income for the periods reported.
Revenues
Earned Premiums
Earned premiums in 2021 were $30.86 billion, $1.81 billion or 6% higher than in 2020. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2021 increased by 3% over 2020. Earned premiums in Business Insurance in 2021 were negatively impacted by lower net written premiums primarily in the latter half of 2020 due to a modest reduction in exposures and a decrease in new business volume, in each case impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Earned premiums in Business Insurance in 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced exposures and reductions in the Company's estimate of ultimate audit premiums receivable, in each case reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions, including a decrease in new business levels. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2021 increased by 11% over 2020. Earned premiums in Bond & Specialty Insurance in 2021 and 2020 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2021 increased by 10% over 2020. Earned premiums in Personal Insurance in 2021 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Earned premiums in Personal Insurance in 2020 were reduced by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Factors contributing to the increase in earned premiums in each segment in 2021 as compared with 2020 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
Net Investment Income
The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s investments.___________________________________________
(1)Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income.
(2)Excludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses.
Net investment income in 2021 was $3.03 billion, $806 million or 36% higher than in 2020. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2021 was $1.99 billion, $22 million lower than in 2020. The decrease primarily resulted from lower long-term interest rates, partially offset by a higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2021 was $7 million, $37 million lower than in 2020. The decrease primarily resulted from lower short-term interest rates. The Company's remaining investment portfolios had net investment income of $1.08 billion in 2021, $868 million higher than in 2020, primarily due to higher private equity partnership returns. Net investment income from these investments in 2020 included the impact of the disruption in global financial markets associated with COVID-19. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis.
Fee Income
Fee income in 2021 was $402 million, $27 million lower than in 2020. The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company’s fee-based business and is discussed in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows.
Net Realized Investment Gains
The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s net pre-tax realized investment gains.
In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a $40 million credit impairment loss from the other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying value of a joint venture investment included in other investments.
Other net realized investment gains in 2021 included $69 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $17 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities sold and $9 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments. Other net realized investment gains in 2020 included $67 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $11 million of net realized investment losses related to equity securities sold and $26 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments.
Other Revenues
Other revenues in all years presented included revenues from Simply Business and installment premium charges. Installment premium charges in 2020 were reduced by billing relief actions offered to customers as a result of COVID-19.
Claims and Expenses
Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses
Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2021 were $20.30 billion, $1.18 billion or 6% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher business volumes, (iv) higher losses in the automobile product line in Personal Insurance due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year and (v) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance, partially offset by (vi) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (vii) a net favorable impact associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance in the aggregate compared to a net charge in 2020. Catastrophes in 2021 primarily resulted from Hurricane Ida, tornado activity in Kentucky, winter storms and severe wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, as well as a wildfire in Colorado. Catastrophes in 2020 primarily resulted from the derecho windstorm in the midwestern region of the United States, the Glass wildfire in California, Tropical Storm Isaias, Hurricanes Zeta and Laura, additional wildfires in the western United States, tornado activity in Tennessee, other severe wind storms and winter storms in several regions of the United States and civil unrest. Catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in 2021 were reduced by the full $350 million of recoveries available under the Company's 2021 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. Catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, including losses from wildfires, in 2020 were reduced by the full $280 million of recoveries available under the Company's 2020 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.
Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2020 included subrogation recoveries related to wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, which are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. Factors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Significant Catastrophe Losses
The Company defines a “catastrophe” as an event:
•that is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and
•for which the Company’s estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.
The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2021 ranged from approximately $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.
The following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in 2021 and 2020 for catastrophes that occurred in 2020 and 2019, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.
___________________________________________
(1) Amounts are reported pre-tax and net of recoveries under all applicable reinsurance treaties, except for the Company's 2021, 2020 and 2019 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Treaties. Those treaties covered the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2021 through and
including December 31, 2021, the period January 1, 2020 through and including December 31, 2020 and the period January 1, 2019 through and including December 31, 2019, respectively. As a result, the benefit from those treaties are not included in the table as the allocation of the treaties' benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event.
(2) In addition to the Glass fire, there were 16 other PCS-designated wildfires in 2020. While none of the 16 wildfires were individually large enough to meet the Company's threshold for disclosure as a significant catastrophe in this table, total losses in 2020 from those wildfires were $169 million, of which two wildfires totaling $73 million met the Company's threshold for disclosure as catastrophes.
n/a: not applicable.
Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs
Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2021 was $5.04 billion, $270 million or 6% higher than in 2020. The increase in 2021 was consistent with the increase in earned premiums. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses in 2021 were $4.68 billion, $168 million or 4% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes. The benefit of lower net expenses related to COVID-19 and related economic conditions in 2021 was higher than in 2020. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in 2021 and 2020 was $340 million and $339 million, respectively.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense in 2021 was $796 million, $256 million or 47% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the $1.22 billion increase in income before income taxes in 2021.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 18% and 17% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rates in both years were lower than the statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company’s income tax provision.
Combined Ratio
The combined ratio of 94.5% in 2021 was 0.5 points lower than the combined ratio of 95.0% in 2020. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 65.1% in 2021 was comparable to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2020. The underwriting expense ratio of 29.4% in 2021 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.9% in 2020.
Catastrophe losses in 2021 and 2020 accounted for 6.0 points and 5.5 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2021 and 2020 provided 1.8 points and 1.2 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses ("underlying combined ratio") in 2021 was 0.4 points lower than the 2020 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance, (ii) a net favorable impact associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance in the aggregate compared to a net charge in 2020 and (iii) a lower expense ratio, partially offset by (iv) higher losses in the automobile product line in Personal Insurance due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity (net of premium refunds) in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year and (v) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance.
The combined ratio continues to be impacted by the tort environment, including more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims.
Written Premiums
Consolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows:
Gross and net written premiums in 2021 increased by 8% and 7%, respectively, over 2020. Gross and net written premiums in 2021 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Gross and net written premiums in Business Insurance in 2021 increased by 5% and 4%, respectively, over 2020. Gross and net written premiums in Business Insurance in 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced exposures, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions, including a decrease in new business levels. Gross and net written premiums in Bond & Specialty Insurance in 2021 increased by 17% and 14%, respectively, over 2020. Gross and net written premiums in Bond & Specialty Insurance in 2020 were negatively impacted by lower surety volumes, primarily due to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Gross and net written premiums in Personal Insurance in 2021 both increased by 10% over 2020. Gross and net written premiums in Personal Insurance in 2020 were negatively impacted by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Factors contributing to the increases in gross and net written premiums in each segment are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT

International. Net written premiums in 2021 were $505 million, $168 million or 50% higher than in 2020, primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom and Canada, including the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Personal Insurance
Results of Personal Insurance were as follows:
Overview
Segment income in 2021 was $760 million, $435 million or 36% lower than segment income of $1.20 billion in 2020. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower underlying underwriting margins, (ii) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) higher catastrophe losses (net of recoveries under the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties), partially offset by (iv) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2021 and 2020 were $1.01 billion and $957 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2021 and 2020 was $260 million and $443 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher losses in the automobile product line due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity (net of premium refunds) in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year and (ii) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line, partially offset by (iii) higher business volumes. Income tax expense in 2021 was lower than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes.
Revenues
Earned Premiums
Earned premiums in 2021 were $11.98 billion, $1.06 billion or 10% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. Net written and earned premiums in 2020 were reduced by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions.
Net Investment Income
Net investment income in 2021 was $521 million, $140 million or 37% higher than in 2020. Refer to the “Net Investment Income” section of the “Consolidated Results of Operations” discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the Company’s consolidated net investment income in 2021 as compared with 2020. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s net investment income allocation methodology.
Other Revenues
Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Installment premium charges in 2021 were higher than in 2020, primarily attributable to the impact of billing relief actions offered to customers as a result of COVID-19 in 2020.
Claims and Expenses
Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses
Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2021 were $8.43 billion, $1.57 billion or 23% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher losses in the automobile product line due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year, (ii) higher business volumes, (iii) loss cost trends, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (v) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line and (vi) higher catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, in both 2021 and 2020, were reduced by recoveries under the Company's Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties.
Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2020 primarily resulted from subrogation recoveries related to wildfires in
California in 2017 and 2018. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs
Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2021 was $1.89 billion, $156 million or 9% higher than in 2020, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses in 2021 were $1.37 billion, $56 million or 4% higher than in 2020. The increase in 2021 primarily reflected higher business volumes. The total in 2020 included an increased allowance for expected credit losses on premiums receivable due to the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense in 2021 was $179 million, $129 million or 42% lower than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the $564 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2021.
Combined Ratio
The combined ratio of 96.5% in 2021 was 6.8 points higher than the combined ratio of 89.7% in 2020. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 70.3% in 2021 was 7.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 62.8% in 2020. The underwriting expense ratio of 26.2% in 2021 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 26.9% in 2020.
Catastrophe losses accounted for 8.5 points and 8.8 points of the combined ratio in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2021 and 2020 provided 2.2 points and 4.1 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2021 was 5.2 points higher than the 2020 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher losses in the automobile product line due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity (net of premium refunds) in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year and (ii) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line.
Written Premiums
Personal Insurance’s gross and net written premiums were as follows:
Gross and net written premiums in 2021 both increased by 10% over 2020. Gross and net written premiums in 2021 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Gross and net written premiums in 2020 were negatively impacted by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions.
Domestic
Automobile net written premiums of $5.83 billion in 2021 increased by 9% over 2020. Net written premiums in 2020 were negatively impacted by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Retention rates remained strong in 2021. Renewal premium changes in 2021 were not significant and were lower than in the same periods of 2020. New business premiums in 2021 increased over 2020.
Homeowners and Other net written premiums of $5.98 billion in 2021 increased by 12% over 2020. Retention rates remained strong in 2021. Renewal premium changes in 2021 remained positive and were higher than in 2020. New business premiums in 2021 increased over 2020.
For its Domestic business, Personal Insurance had approximately 8.9 million and 8.4 million active policies at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
International
International net written premiums of $684 million in 2021 increased by 5% over 2020, primarily driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
For its International business, Personal Insurance had approximately 477,000 and 491,000 active policies at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Interest Expense and Other
(for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019
Income (loss) $ (291) $ (291) $ (297)
The Income (loss) for Interest Expense and Other in both 2021 and 2020 was $(291) million. Pre-tax interest expense in 2021 and 2020 was $340 million and $339 million, respectively. After-tax interest expense in 2021 and 2020 was $269 million and $268 million, respectively.
ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION
The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants, such as manufacturers of talcum powder, who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company’s asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.
The Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy, over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.
In addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers’ conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be filed in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.
Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder with open claims at least annually. Among the factors the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder’s potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
The Company's net asbestos reserves at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1.34 billion, and include case reserves, IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing policyholders, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Asbestos reserves also include amounts related to certain policyholders with whom the Company has entered into permanent settlement agreements, which are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Additionally, a portion of the asbestos reserves
relates to assumed reinsurance contracts primarily consisting of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.
The Company conducts an annual review of domestic policyholders with open asbestos claims. Policyholders are identified for this review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential “non-product” exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder.
In the third quarter of 2021, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of policyholders with open claims and litigation cases for potential product and "non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:
•a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims;
•while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the high level of litigation activity; and
•a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.
Both the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims and net asbestos-related payments decreased slightly when compared to 2020. Payments on behalf of these policyholders continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.
The Company’s quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders and the assumed reinsurance component of reserves, as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company’s evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
The completion of these reviews and analyses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 resulted in $225 million, $295 million and $220 million increases, respectively, to the Company’s net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company’s estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs primarily resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the continued high level of mesothelioma claim filings and the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding those claims discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company’s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company’s overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.
Net asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $221 million, $237 million and $224 million, respectively. Approximately 9%, 1% and 4% of total net paid losses in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company entered into settlement agreements that limit those policyholders' ability to present future claims to the Company.
The following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves:
ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION
The Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of the alleged storage, emissions or disposal of toxic substances, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions pertaining to environmental claims have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. For more information regarding environmental claims and litigation, see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $89 million, $54 million and $76 million, respectively. Net environmental paid loss and loss expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $75 million, $69 million and $90 million, respectively. Net environmental reserves were $321 million, $307 million and $321 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES
As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management’s judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation:
•the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
•a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated;
•the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements;
•the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
•the resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these disputes;
•the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
•future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;
•any impact on asbestos defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos defendants;
•the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and
•uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders.
Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.
Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s operating results in future periods.
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
The Company’s invested assets at December 31, 2021 were $87.38 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
The carrying value of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2021 was $77.81 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company’s insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was “Aa2” at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Below investment grade securities represented 1.4% and 1.8% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.2 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2021 and 3.8 (4.0 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2020.
The carrying values of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

(2)Sovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the Federal Ship Financing Programs.
(3)Included in commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $207 million and $392 million of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, respectively.
The following table sets forth the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist:
Obligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions
The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $36.86 billion and $36.36 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $4.03 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company’s holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have either been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities or have FHA guarantees subject to federal appropriation.
The following table shows the geographic distribution of the $32.83 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2021 that were not pre-refunded:

The Company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. The weighted average credit rating of the municipal bond portfolio was “Aaa/Aa1” at December 31, 2021.
Debt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments
The following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company’s long-term fixed maturity investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments at December 31, 2021:
___________________________________________
(1)Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.
(2) No other country accounted for 2.5% or more of total debt securities issued by foreign governments.
The following table shows the Company’s Eurozone exposure at December 31, 2021 to all debt securities issued by foreign governments, financial companies, sovereign corporations (including sovereign banks) whose securities are backed by the respective country’s government and all other corporate securities (comprised of industrial corporations and utility companies) which could be affected if economic conditions deteriorated due to a prolonged recession:
___________________________________________
(1)Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The table includes $434 million of short-term securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated “A-1+” and/or “P-1,” are included as “Aaa” rated securities.
In addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $300 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $206 million to these partnerships.
Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities
The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $1.82 billion and $2.36 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company’s investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company’s investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company’s assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company’s investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $1.30 billion and $1.42 billion, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Equity Securities, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments
See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.
Other Investments
The Company also invests in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than investments in fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. The Company also enters into certain derivative financial instruments from time to time that are reported as part of other investments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.86 billion and $3.40 billion, respectively. The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships, real estate partnerships and others in which it invests. These commitments totaled $1.70 billion and $1.72 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet these commitments.
Securities Lending
The Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $253 million and $139 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2021 and 2020 was $329 million and $254 million, respectively. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. The Company did not incur any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Lloyd’s Trust Deposits
The Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd’s using a combination of the share capital and retained earnings of the Company's subsidiaries participating in Lloyd's, trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $33 million and $119 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $34 million and $35 million held by TRV at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were pledged into Lloyd’s trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd’s capital requirements. For more information regarding the Company’s utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein.
Net Unrealized Investment Gains
The net unrealized investment gains that were included in shareholders' equity were as follows:
Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 decreased by $1.66 billion from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in interest rates during 2021. Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had no fixed maturity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost.
For fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, below investment grade securities comprised 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2021 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $239 million and a fair value of $232 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $7 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of both the amortized cost and fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2021 and accounted for approximately 2% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2021.
Impairment Charges
Impairment charges included in net realized investment gains in the consolidated statement of income were $2 million and $55 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total in 2020 included a $40 million other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying value of an equity method investment included in other investments. See note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Purchases and Sales of Investment Securities
Purchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company’s ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred pre-tax realized losses of $5 million on the sale of fixed maturity investments having a fair value of $488 million.
CATASTROPHE MODELING
The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.
The Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors, including non-modeled losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are updated regularly as new information and techniques emerge.
The tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax, and as a percentage of the Company’s common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2021. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company’s loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $2.0 billion, or 8% of the Company’s common equity at December 31, 2021.
___________________________________________
(1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a “1-in-50 year event.” As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.
(2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company’s management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company’s financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.
The threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company’s in-force portfolio at December 31, 2021 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1, 2022, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company’s reinsurance, see “Item 1 - Business-Reinsurance.” The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company’s catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers’ compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.
Catastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.
Moreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers’ compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.
In addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes, hail storms wildfires and winter storms are
newer and may be less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. Accordingly, these models may be less accurate in predicting risks and estimating losses. Further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. As compared to natural catastrophes, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is even more difficult and less reliable, and for some events (both natural and man-made), models are either in early stages of development and, therefore, not widely adopted, or are not available.
For more information about the Company’s exposure to catastrophe losses, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance” and “Item 1A - Risk Factors- We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.”
CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS
Severe weather events over the last two decades underscore the unpredictability of climate trends, and changing climate conditions have added to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. The insurance industry has experienced increased catastrophe losses due to a number of potential causal factors, including, in addition to weather/climate variability, aging infrastructure, more people living in high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker enforcement of building codes, urban expansion, an increase in the number of amenities included in, and average size of, a home and increased inflation, including as a results of post-event demand surge. For example, the frequency and severity of tornado and hail events in the United States have been more volatile during this time period. In addition, climate studies by government agencies, academic institutions, catastrophe modeling organizations and other groups indicate that we are experiencing, and are expected to continue to experience over time, an increase in frequency and/or intensity of hurricanes, heavy precipitation events, flash flooding, sea level rise, droughts, heat waves and wildfires. Understanding the potential impacts of changing climate conditions is important to the Company's business. Changing climate conditions are expected to evolve over decades. Importantly, because most of its policies renew annually, the Company is able to respond to these changes over time through adjustments to its underwriting strategy, product pricing and related policy terms and conditions, as appropriate. As an example, in recent years the Company has focused on enhancing the strategic management of its catastrophe exposure, adding experts in data science, meteorology, geophysics and environmental engineering, among others, to its catastrophe management organization. The Company also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril, with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. These results have been incorporated into the Company’s product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation and claim response.
The Company discusses how changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under “Item 1A - Risk Factors.” and “Outlook.” For example, among other things:
•Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance” and “-Outlook-Underwriting Gain/Loss.” Moreover, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events, emerging trends in climate conditions and regulatory responses to catastrophe events not being appropriately reflected in the models, in addition to the other factors mentioned above. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events.
•Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southwestern United States; more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southeastern United States, among other areas; and increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions could impact the creditworthiness of issuers affects by such regulations. In addition, as issuers of securities in which the Company invests become increasingly focused on mitigating the potential environmental impact of their operations, the costs associated with such initiatives could affect the business models and realized returns of such issuers. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors-Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses.”
•Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company’s ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. For example, one state passed legislation that restricted a carrier's ability to cancel or non-renew certain policies within or adjacent to declared state of emergency zip codes. If the Company is unable to implement risk-based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See “Item 1 - Business-U.S. State and Federal Regulation-Regulatory and Legislative Responses to Catastrophes.” In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company’s customers’ costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.
•The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. For example, from time to time third parties sue our policyholders alleging that they caused or contributed to changing climate conditions. Through the Company’s Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews emerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors-The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after we issue our policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.”
REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES
The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For additional discussion regarding the Company’s reinsurance coverage, see “Part I-Item 1 - Business-Reinsurance.”
The following table summarizes the composition of the Company’s reinsurance recoverables:
Net reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2021 increased by $102 million from December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of catastrophe losses in 2021, partially offset by a lower level of structured settlements and recoverables from mandatory pools and associations.
The following table presents the Company’s top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2021 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant reinsurer from each such reinsurer group at February 17, 2022:
At December 31, 2021, the Company held $981 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables.
Included in net reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company’s top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2021 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company’s predominant insurer from each such insurer group at February 17, 2022:
The Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.
OUTLOOK
The following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company’s results of operations and capital position.
Premiums. The Company’s earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Overall, the Company expects that retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2022.
Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2022 for new business. In each of the Company’s business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. In periods of meaningful decreases in new business, despite its negative impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of lower new business levels may positively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.
Underwriting Gain/Loss. The Company’s underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss trend, including as a result of COVID-19 and related economic conditions; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments.
Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.
On average for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced approximately 40% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company's reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates.
Over much of the past decade, the Company’s results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.
It is possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by federal, state and/or local governments and the Federal Reserve could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company’s loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. Labor shortages, higher costs of used vehicles and parts, and increased demand and decreased supply for raw materials are adversely impacting severity in our auto and property businesses and may continue to do so in future quarters. For a further discussion, see “Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors-If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.”
Economic conditions and therefore the Company’s results of operations may be impacted by a variety of other factors as well, many of which could continue to be affected by COVID-19, such as the pace of the economic recovery, financial market volatility, supply chain disruptions, extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the political and regulatory environment, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and potential changes in tax laws.
Investment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.2 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2021. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company regularly evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company’s investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, and private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for greater volatility and higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.
Approximately 29% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (including the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). As a result, the overall yield on and composition of its portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for reinvestment with the proceeds of maturing bonds.
Net investment income is a material contributor to the Company’s results of operations. Based on our current expectations for slightly higher levels of fixed income investments, partially offset by the impact of expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed income investments, the Company expects that after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $430 million to $440 million for each quarter of 2022. This expectation could be impacted by disruptions in global financial markets.
Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income or loss from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis. Net investment income from these other investments was particularly strong during 2021 reflecting strong global financial market performance. Given the particularly strong 2021 performance, the Company expects that net investment income from these other investments in 2022 will be significantly lower than in 2021. The Company’s net investment income in future periods from its non-fixed income investment portfolio will be impacted, positively or negatively, by the performance of global financial markets.
The Company had net pre-tax realized investment gains of $171 million in 2021. Changes in global financial markets could result in net realized investment gains or losses in the Company’s investment portfolio.
The Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $3.06 billion ($2.42 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders’ equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. Additionally, disruptions in global financial markets could also impact the market value of the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio. See "Our businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which we conduct business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including higher tax rates, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth" included in “Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.”
