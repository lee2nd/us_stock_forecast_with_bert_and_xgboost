ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a high growth, biotechnology company at the forefront of delivering sustainable solutions that are better for people and the planet. To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable consumption, we create, manufacture and commercialize consumer products and ingredients that reach more than 300 million consumers. Currently, the largest driver of our revenue is derived from marketing and selling Clean Beauty, Personal Care and Health & Wellness consumer products through our direct-to-consumer ecommerce platforms and a growing network of retail partners. We also sell sustainable ingredients to sector leaders that serve Flavor & Fragrance (F&F), Nutrition, Food & Beverage, and Clean Beauty & Personal Care end markets.
We began 2021 with three consumer brands, Biossance® clean beauty skincare, Pipette® clean baby skincare, and PurecaneTM zero-calorie sweetener. During the second half of 2021, we launched five additional consumer brands in the Clean Beauty & Personal Care end market, including Terasana® clean skincare, Costa Brazil® luxury skincare, OLIKATM clean wellness, Rose Inc.TM clean color cosmetics, and JVNTM clean haircare.
Our ingredients and consumer products are powered by our fermentation-based Lab-to-MarketTM technology platform. This technology platform drives the portfolio connection between our proprietary science and formulation expertise, our manufacturing capability at industrial scale, and our ability to commercialize sustainable products that make a difference in people’s lives. We believe that our technology platform offers advantages to traditional methods of sourcing similar ingredients (such as petrochemistry and extraction from organisms). Our technology platform allows for renewable and ethical sourcing of raw materials, less resource-intensive production, minimal impact on sensitive ecosystems, enhanced purity and safety profile, less vulnerability to climate disruption, and improved supply chain resilience. We bring together biology and engineering to generate more sustainable materials that would otherwise be scarce or endangered in nature. Our technology platform leverages state-of-the-art machine learning, robotics and artificial intelligence, enabling us to rapidly bring new innovation to market. Our revenue is generated from consumer product sales, ingredient product sales, research and development collaboration programs and grants, and consumer marketing services.
Our time from lab to market for molecules has decreased from three to four years to less than a year for our most recent molecule, mainly due to our ability to leverage our technology platform with proprietary strain construction, screening and analytics tools, advanced lab automation, and data integration. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes industry-leading strain engineering and lab automation located in Emeryville, California, pilot-scale production facilities in Emeryville and Campinas, Brazil, a demonstration-scale facility in Campinas and a commercial scale production facility in Leland, North Carolina (which is part of our Aprinnova joint venture). While a wide variety of feedstocks for production exists, we source Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its supply resilience, renewability, low cost, and relative price stability. We are in the process of constructing a new purpose-built, large-scale specialty ingredients facility in Brazil, which we anticipate will allow for the manufacture of up to five products concurrently. We expect construction to be completed in the first half of 2022. Pending commissioning of the new facility, we continue to manufacture our products at manufacturing sites in Brazil, the United States and Europe.
COVID-19 Business Update
We closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it has and will impact our employees, partners, supply chain, and distribution network. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, we developed a comprehensive response strategy including establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 task force and implementing business continuity plans to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business. We have applied recommended public health strategies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and have been focused on the health and welfare of our employees. We have successfully managed to sustain ongoing critical production campaigns and infrastructure while staying in compliance with State and County public health orders.
Accordingly, since the end of the first quarter of 2020, we have initiated several precautions in accordance with local regulations and guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection across our businesses, which has impacted the way we carry out our business, including additional sanitation and cleaning procedures in our laboratories and other facilities, on-site COVID-19 testing, temperature and symptom confirmations, instituting remote working when possible, and implementing social distancing and staggered worktime requirements for our employees who must work on-site. Our plans to reopen our sites and enable a broad return to work in our offices, laboratories and production facilities will continue to follow local public health plans and guidelines. As the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of vaccines continue to rapidly evolve, even if our employees more broadly return to work in our offices, laboratories and production facilities, we have the flexibility to resume more restrictive on-site and remote work models, if needed, as a result of spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rates or otherwise. See “Risk Factors - Business and Operational Risks - Our business is currently adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic slowdown as a result of the recent and potential future impacts on our supply chain, manufacturing and commercialization activities and other business operations.”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
Our most critical accounting estimates include:
•Revenue recognition, including arrangements with multiple performance obligations;
•Valuation and allocation of fair value to elements of complex related party transactions;
•The valuation of freestanding and embedded derivatives, which impacts gains or losses on such derivatives, the carrying value of debt, interest expense and deemed dividends;
•The valuation of debt for which we have elected fair value accounting; and
•The valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and contingent consideration payables, which are generated through business acquisitions.
For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting estimates and policies, see Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. For a discussion related to fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 5, 2021, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investors.amyris.com.
Revenue
Years Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2021 2020 Change
Revenue:
Renewable products $ 149,703 $ 104,338 43 %
Licenses and royalties 173,812 50,991 241 %
Collaborations, grants and other 18,302 17,808 3 %
Total revenue $ 341,817 $ 173,137 97 %
Total revenue increased by 97% to $341.8 million in 2021. Renewable products revenue increased by 43% to $149.7 million in 2021, due to a $39.5 million, or 76% increase in consumer products revenue and a $6.0 million, or 11% increase in ingredients revenue.
Licenses and royalties revenue increased by 241% to $173.8 million in 2021, primarily due to a $149.6 million license of intellectual property for our flavors and fragrances molecules and certain farnesene technology to DSM and $10.0 million of license revenue from the licensing of RebM related intellectual property to PureCircle.
Grants and collaborations revenue increased by 3% to $18.3 million in 2021, mainly due to increased collaboration revenue from DSM.
Our revenues are dependent on the timing and nature of arrangements entered into with our customers, which may include multiple performance obligations for which revenue accounting requires significant judgement and estimates. Consequently, our revenues may vary significantly from one period to the next.
Cost and Operating Expenses
Years Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2021 2020 Change
Cost of products sold $ 155,139 $ 87,812 77 %
Research and development 94,289 71,676 32 %
Sales, general and administrative 257,811 137,071 88 %
Impairment 12,204 - nm
Total cost and operating expenses $ 519,443 $ 296,559 75 %
______________
nm = not meaningful
Cost of Products Sold
Cost of products sold includes the costs of raw materials, labor and overhead, amounts paid to contract manufacturers, inventory write-downs resulting from applying lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments, and costs related to production scale-up. Because of the diversity of profit margins within our product offerings and changes in product mix sold period over period, our cost of products sold typically does not change proportionately with changes in renewable product revenue period over period.
Cost of products sold increased by 77% to $155.1 million in 2021, due to a corresponding 43% increase in renewable products revenue, coupled with a significant increase in manufacturing input costs for our ingredients products.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by 31.5% to $94.3 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in outside consulting professional services related to the IDRI collaboration and employee compensation related to an additional 73 employees.
Sales, General and Administrative Expenses
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 88% to $257.8 million in 2021, due to a $68.0 million increase in sales and marketing expense related to our consumer brands and a $21.8 million increase in employee compensation related to an additional 295 employees, mostly within our sales and marketing consumer brand teams.
Impairment
In 2021, we impaired the remaining $12.2 million of deferred cost of products sold asset related to manufacturing capacity fees paid to DSM for the production of RebM at DSM's Brotas, Brazil facility. Due to the anticipated timing of completing and commissioning our new fermentation facility in Barra Bonita, Brazil, which is anticipated by the end of the second quarter of 2022, the timing of the demand forecast for RebM, and the timing of production runs for other ingredients at the Brotas facility, we determined RebM will not be manufactured at the DSM facility in 2022 and concluded the deferred cost of products sold asset was no longer recoverable.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Years Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2021 2020 Change
Interest expense $ (25,605) $ (47,951) (47) %
Gain (loss) from change in fair value of derivative instruments 1,453 (11,362) (113) %
Loss from change in fair value of debt (38,649) (89,827) (57) %
Loss upon extinguishment of debt (32,464) (51,954) (38) %
Other income (expense), net 580 666 (13) %
Total other expense, net $ (94,685) $ (200,428) (53) %
Total other expense, net was $94.7 million in 2021, compared to $200.4 million in 2020. The $105.7 million decrease was primarily comprised of a $51.2 million decrease in loss from change in fair value of debt, a $22.3 million decrease in interest expense, a $19.5 million decrease in loss upon extinguishment of debt, and a $12.8 million swing from a loss to a gain in change in fair value of derivative instruments.
The decrease in loss from change in fair value of debt was due to the extinguishment of the Senior Convertible Notes during the first half of 2021 and a 12% decrease in our stock price during 2021.
The swing from a loss to a gain in change in fair value of derivative instruments was primarily due to a 12% decrease in our stock price during 2021; see Note 3, "Fair Value Measurement" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding our outstanding derivative instruments.
The loss upon extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a $28.9 million loss in connection with exchange of the Schottenfeld notes into common stock, and early payment penalties in connection with the repayment in full of certain other debt instruments.
The reduction in interest expense was due to a decrease in debt discount accretion, along with lower average debt principal balances in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an income tax benefit of $8.1 million related to the reversal of an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations had expired. See Note 14, "Income Taxes" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

(In thousands) 2021 2020
Net cash (used in) provided by:
Operating activities $ (181,333) $ (175,753)
Investing activities (64,098) (12,781)
Financing activities 701,962 222,525
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 359 (4,268)
Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 456,890 $ 29,723
Liquidity
We have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operations through at least the next 12 months following the issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, we had working capital of $369.4 million, an accumulated deficit of $2.4 billion, and cash and cash equivalents of $483.5 million.
As of December 31, 2021, the principal amounts due under our debt instruments (including related party debt) totaled $740.9 million, of which $50.9 million is classified as current. However, $50.0 million of the $50.9 million of current principal due is related party debt that is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at $3.00 per share, which we anticipate will convert into common shares at maturity on July 1, 2022. One of our debt agreements contains various financial and non-financial covenants, including certain restrictions on our business - including restrictions on additional indebtedness, material adverse effect and cross default provisions - that could cause us to be at risk of default. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our debt instruments, including any failure to make payments when required, would generally result in events of default under such instruments, which could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of such indebtedness. Acceleration would generally also constitute an event of default under our other outstanding debt instruments, which could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our debt repayment obligations.
Based on our cash and cash equivalents of $483.5 million as of December 31, 2021, we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations during the next 12 months from the date of filing our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, our ability to execute our planned operations, including the completion of our new specialty ingredients fermentation facility in Brazil, will depend in large part, on our ability to (i) minimize the anticipated negative cash flows from operations during the 12 months from the date of this filing and (ii) achieve certain milestones under the March 2021 DSM transaction and the June 2021 Ingredion transaction (see Note 10, “Revenue” and Note 5, "Mezzanine Equity”, respectively in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information), all of which are uncertain and/or outside of our control.
Our operating plan for 2022 contemplates a significant reduction in net operating cash outflows as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting from (i) revenue growth from sales of existing and new products with positive gross margins, (ii) reduced production costs as a result of technical developments and transitioning to the new manufacturing facility during the second half of 2022, and (iii) an increase in cash inflows from milestone royalties under the DSM and Ingredion license agreements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash inflows from product sales, licenses and collaboration arrangements, we will need to obtain additional funding from new equity or debt financings, which may not occur timely or on reasonable terms, if at all, and agree to burdensome covenants, grant further security interests in our assets, enter into collaboration and licensing arrangements that require us to relinquish commercial rights, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable.
For details, see the following Notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:
•Note 4, "Debt"
•Note 5, "Mezzanine Equity"
•Note 6, "Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)"
