Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please see the cautionary note regarding these statements at the beginning of this report.
Overview
The Company is engaged in the GameFi business in the metaverse ecosystem. In addition, to a lesser extent, the Company is engaged in the provision of aircraft advisory and management services since September 30, 2021.
On October 20, 2021, the Company set up Mega Metaverse Corp. (“Mega”), a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in California. In December 2021, the Company launched its GameFi business in the metaverse ecosystem through Mega, and released its first NFT game “Mano” on March 25, 2022. Mano is a competitive idle role-playing game (RPG) deploying the concept of GameFi in the innovative combination of NFTs (non-fungible token) and DeFi (decentralized finance) based on blockchain technology, with a “Play-to-earn” business model that the players can earn while they play in Mega’s metaverse universe “alSpace”.
Previously, the Company has historically provided leasing and finance services to regional airlines worldwide and has been principally engaged in leasing mid-life regional aircraft to customers worldwide under operating leases and finance leases. In addition to leasing activities, the Company has also sold aircraft from its operating lease portfolio to third parties, including other leasing companies, financial services companies, and airlines. Its operating performance was driven by the composition of its aircraft portfolio, the terms of its leases, and the interest rate of its debt, as well as asset sales.
On March 29, 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filing was made in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) Case No. 21-10636 (the “Chapter 11 Case”). The Company also filed motions with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to continue to operate our business as “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
On September 30, 2021, we emerged from bankruptcy with a restructured balance sheet, a new management team, and a new purpose to focus on new lines of business other than the aircraft leasing business.
On September 30, 2021 (“Effective Date”) and pursuant to the Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Company entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Plan Sponsor, and Yucheng Hu, in the capacity as the representative for the Plan Sponsor thereunder, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, and the Plan Sponsor purchased, 14,354,635 shares of common stock (given effect to five for one forward stock split), par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “ACY Common Stock”) at $0.77 (given effect to five for one forward stock split) for each share of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11,053,100 (the “Purchase Price”). The Securities Purchase Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties to such agreement.
The principal terms of the Plan Sponsor Agreement are below:
● Plan Sponsor Equity Investment. The Plan Sponsor Agreement provides for the issuance by the Company of 14,354,635 shares of common stock (given effect to five for one forward stock split) (“New ACY Shares”) at a purchase price equal to $0.77 (given effect to five for one forward stock split), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11 million. The New ACY Shares issuance would result in post-issuance pro forma ownership percentages of the Company common stock of (a) 65% held by the Plan Sponsor, and (b) 35% held by existing shareholders of the Company on the Effective Date (the “Legacy ACY Shareholders”).
● Refundability of the Deposit. In the event the purchase of the New ACY Shares does not close as a result of Plan Sponsor’s failure to comply with the terms of Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Deposit will be forfeited to the Company. In the event the purchase of the New ACY Shares does not close as a result of Debtors’ failure to comply with the terms of the Plan Sponsor Agreement or the failure of the conditions precedent set forth in the Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Deposit will be refunded to Plan Sponsor. If Bankruptcy Court or any regulatory authority having the authority to block the consummation of the purchase of the New ACY Shares do not approve of the purchase of the New ACY Shares, the Deposit will be refunded to Plan Sponsor.
● Breakup Fee. If the Bankruptcy Court accepts and approves an exit financing transaction for the Company with a party other than the Plan Sponsor (an “Alternative Transaction”) then the Company shall pay Plan Sponsor, upon the closing of such Alternative Transaction, in addition to the return of the Deposit, a breakup fee equal to $1,000,000.
● New Capital Structure for JetFleet Holding Corp. (“JHC”). On the Effective Date, the following transactions relating to JHC equity ownership shall be executed:
a) Cancellation of the Company’s Equity in JHC. All outstanding stock of JetFleet Holding Corp. (“JHC”) currently held 100% by the Company, was canceled.
b) JHC Common Stock Issuance to Plan Sponsor and JHC Management. Plan Sponsor shall acquire 35,000 shares of common stock of JHC, and certain employees of JHC (“JHC Management”) who will be appointed to continue the legacy aircraft leasing business of the Company through JHC shall have the right to acquire 65,000 shares of common stock of JHC. All shares of common stock of JHC will be purchased at a price of $1 per share. In January 2022, JHC Management completed the purchase of 65,000 shares of common stock of JHC.
c) JHC Series A Preferred Stock Issuance to the Company. The Company will use $2 million of its proceeds from the Plan Sponsor’s purchase of New ACY Shares to purchase 104,082 shares of JHC Series A Preferred Stock from JHC. The JHC Series A Preferred Stock shall carry a dividend rate of 7.5% per annum, shall be non-convertible and non-transferable, shall be redeemable by JHC at any time, but shall only be redeemable by the Company after 7 years. As of December 31, 2021, the JHC Series A Preferred Stockholders shall in the aggregate constitute 74.83% of the voting equity of JHC, voting as a single class together with the outstanding JHC Common Stock.
d) Distribution of Trust Interest in JHC Series B to Legacy ACY Shareholders. A trust (“Legacy Trust”) will be established for the benefit of the Legacy ACY Shareholders, and JHC will issue new JHC Series B Preferred Stock to the Legacy Trust. The JHC Series B Preferred Stock issued to the Legacy Trust will have an aggregate liquidation preference of $1, non-convertible, non-transferable, non-voting, will not pay a dividend, and will contain a mandatory, redeemable provision. The JHC Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemable for an aggregate amount equal to (i) $1,000,000, if the JHC Series B Preferred Stock is redeemed after the first fiscal year for which JHC reports positive EBITDA for the preceding 12-month period, or (ii) $0.001 per share, if the JHC Series B Preferred Stock is redeemed prior the first fiscal year for which JHC reports positive EBITDA for the preceding 12-month period.
On December 23, 2021, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to (i) implement a 5-for-1 forward stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Stock Split”), and (ii) to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company from 13,000,000 to 40,000,000, effective December 30, 2021.
On March 18, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, amending Article I to change its name from AeroCentury Corp. to Mega Matrix Corp., effective March 25, 2022 (the “Name Change”). In connection with the Name Change, the Company’s ticker symbol was changed from “ACY” to “MTMT” on the NYSE American, effective March 28, 2022.
Results of Operations
Revenues and Other Income
Revenues and other income decreased by 62% to $6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $16.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily a result of (i) a 59% decrease in operating lease revenues to $6.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $15.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of reduced rent income from the sale of aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the whole year of 2021, and (ii) reduced rent for three assets in the 2021 as a result of lease extensions and related rent reductions, the effects of which were partially offset by reduced rent for two assets in the 2020 period as a result of lease amendments related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had total operating expenses of $19.2 million, which was comprised primarily of impairment in value of aircraft, interest expense, professional fees and administrative expenses, and depreciation expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had operating expenses of $62.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $4.2 million on seven assets held for sale, based on appraised values or expected sales proceeds. During 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses totaling $14,639,900 for seven of its aircraft held for lease, comprised of (i) $7,006,600 for two aircraft that were written down to their sales prices, less cost of sale and (ii) $7,633,300 for five aircraft that were written down based on third-party appraisals, and also recorded losses of $11,337,200 for a turboprop aircraft and three regional jet aircraft that are held for sale and that were written down based on third-party appraisals and $2,774,700 for three regional jet aircraft and two turboprop aircraft that were being sold in parts based on estimated sales prices, less cost of sale, provided by the part-out vendors.
The Company’s interest expense decreased by 85% to $2.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $16.8 million in 2020, as a result of the Company’s Chapter 11 filing in late March 2021, after which the Company did not accrue interest on the Drake Indebtedness. In addition, the Company sold five aircraft in August 2021 and the proceeds, totaling $41.6 million, were used to pay down the Drake Indebtedness. The high interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a result of a higher average interest rates and interest expense related to the termination of the Company’s two MUFG Swaps in 2020, partially offset by a lower average debt balance.
Professional fees, general and administrative and other expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 50% to $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of professional expenses incurred by the Company to enter into the new GameFi business.
Depreciation expense decreased by $5.9 million, or 83% to $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the reclassification of aircraft from held for lease to held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2020 and second quarter of 2021, as well as a decrease in depreciation for two aircraft that were written down to their estimated sale values during the second quarter of 2020 and were sold during the fourth quarter.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $27.7 million as reorganization gains.
The Company had a tax provision of $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to tax benefit of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was a 1.79% tax benefits compared to a 7.8% tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The difference in the effective income tax rate from the normal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily related to nontaxable cancellation of debt income that was excluded from the Company’s taxable income. In addition, the Company recorded a valuation allowance in the current period on the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. In assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or availability to carryback the losses to taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considered several factors when analyzing the need for a valuation allowance, including the Company’s current three-year cumulative loss through December 31, 2021, the impacts of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the worldwide airline industry and the Company’s recent filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that a valuation allowance is necessary for the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax assets not supported by either future taxable income or availability of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and has recorded a valuation allowance of $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a valuation allowance of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On September 30, 2021, the Company emerged from bankruptcy with a restructured balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total net assets of approximately $11.8 million.
As the Company has disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company settled the liabilities subject to compromise with aircraft included in the assets held for sale.
On September 30, 2021 and pursuant to the Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Company closed the transactions with the Plan Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, and the Plan Sponsor purchased, 14,354,635 shares of common stock (given effect to five for one forward stock split), par value $0.001 per share, of the Company at $0.77 (given effect to five for one forward stock split) for each share of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11,053,100. The Plan Sponsor made the payments before September 30, 2021.
As a result of the effectiveness of the Plan, the Company believes it has the ability to meet its obligations for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course business.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and (iii) the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for the application of fresh start accounting, realization of goodwill, current value of the Company’s assets held for sale, the amount and timing of future cash flows associated with each asset that are used to evaluate whether assets are impaired, accounting for income taxes, and the amounts recorded as allowances for doubtful accounts.
Cash Flow
Because the Company just emerged from bankruptcy on September 30, 2021, the cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to provision and usage by the predecessor of the Company for the period from January 1, 2021 through September 29, 2021, and provision and usage by the successor of the Company for the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
Since emerging from bankruptcy to date, we have financed the operations primarily through cash flow from operations and capital injections from our sponsors. We plan to support our future operations primarily from cash generated from our operations and cash on hand.
Currently, the Company’s primary uses of cash are for (i) salaries, employee benefits and general and administrative expenses, (ii) professional fees and legal expenses; and (iii) purchases of research and development services in relation with our newly launched GameFi business.
Actual results could deviate substantially from the assumptions management has made in forecasting the Company’s future cash flow. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, there are a number of factors that may cause actual results to deviate from these forecasts. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect and the Company’s cash requirements exceed its cash flow, the Company would need to pursue additional sources of financing to satisfy these requirements, which may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
The following is a discussion of historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:
Operating activities
The Company’s net cash outflow from operations was $1.1 million for the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021, which was mainly attributable to payment of $1.3 million for professional fees and legal expenses with respect to the Company’s Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring and recapitalization effort.
The Company’s net cash outflow from operations was $1.3 million for the period from January 1, 2021 through September 29, 2021, which was mainly attributable collection of finance lease income of $1.1 million, against payment of $2.4 million for professional fees and legal expenses with respect to the Company’s Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring and recapitalization effort.
The Company’s net cash inflow from operations was $4.0 million in 2020, which was mainly primarily the result of rents received of $13.4 million and expenditures for G&A, salaries and interest of $3.8 million, $2.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
Investing activities
For the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the Company made a deposit of $1.0 million to a third-party vendor for development of Mano, our first NFT game.
For the period from January 1, 2021 through September 29, 2021, the Company received net cash of $12.0 million from asset sales.
During the year end December 31, 2020, the Company received net cash of $17.1 million from asset sales.
Financing activities
For the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the Company paid special dividends of $999,800 to stockholders that held shares of Common Stock of the Company as of the effective date of the Plan prior to the sale and issuance of Common Stock of the Company to the plan sponsor investors.
For the period from January 1, 2021 through September 29, 2021, the Plan Sponsor contributed $11.0 million to the Company to subscribe for 14,354,635 shares of common stock (given effect to five for one forward stock split), and repaid notes payable of $16.5 million
During 2020 and 2021, the Company borrowed $5.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively in the form of paid-in-kind interest that was added to the outstanding principal balance under the MUFG Indebtedness and Drake Indebtedness. In 2020, the Company repaid $1.2 million and $16.8 million, respectively, of its total outstanding debt under the MUFG Indebtedness and Nord Term Loans. During 2020, the Company also paid approximately $1.7 million for debt issuance and amendment fees.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements or during the applicable reporting period. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company’s operating results and financial position could be materially affected. For a further discussion of Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates, refer to Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
