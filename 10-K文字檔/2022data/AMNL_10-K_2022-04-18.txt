Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Financial Statements
In December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread globally, to include Canada, the United States and several European countries. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses.
As local jurisdictions continue to put restrictions in place, our ability to continue to operate our business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations
To date, COVID-19 has not had a material financial impact on the Company. However, COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in transportation and limited access to the Company’s facility, resulting in limited support from its staff and professional advisors. The small size of the Company’s accounting staff and the additional responsibilities emanating from COVID-19 may cause a delay in the Company’s ability to complete subsequent reports in a timely manner.
RECENT ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments within ASU No. 2019-12 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 had no impact on the Company’s financial results.
Results of Operations - 2021 Compared to 2020
The following sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain components of our operating earnings, including such data stated as percentage of revenues:
*
Includes $234,409
and $75,669 of non-cash stock compensation expense for 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee, director and consultant stock options.
Revenue generated during 2021 was $1,409,019 compared to $879,169 of revenue generated during the same period in 2020, an increase of $529,850 or 60%. The increase was driven primarily by a $454,379, or 84%, increase in sales of AMIRON iron oxide.
Sales of AMIRON during 2021 totaled $994,079, an increase of $389,579, or approximately 64%, when compared to 2020. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in sales to a manufacturer of cement.
Sales of DRAGONITE during 2021 totaled $414,940, an increase of $140,271, or approximately 51% when compared to 2020. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in sales to customers for use in flame retardent applications, partially offset by a decline in sales to a customer for use in an oilfield application due to the disruption in the oil markets.
Operating expenses incurred during 2021 totaled $3,501,548, a decrease of $211,267, or 6%, when compared to 2020. The decline in operating expenses was driven primarily by a $670,890, or 30%, decline in general and administrative expense partially offset by a $412,885, or 33%, increase in production costs when compared to 2020.
Production costs include those operating expenses which management believes are directly related to the mining and processing of the Company’s iron oxide and halloysite minerals, which result in the production of its AMIRON and DRAGONITE products for commercial sale. Production costs include, but are not limited to, wages and benefits of employees who mine material and who work in the Company’s milling operations, energy costs associated with the operation of the Company’s two mills, the cost of mining and milling supplies and the cost of the maintenance and repair of the Company’s mining and milling equipment. Wages and energy expenses are the two largest components of the Company’s production costs.
Production costs during 2021 were $1,658,661, an increase of $412,885, or 33%, when compared to 2020. The increase was driven primarily by a $314,354 increase in contract labor due to an increase in iron mining production and a $75,846 increase in clay processing expense related to the purchase of inventory upon the termination of a tolling agreement.
Exploration costs include operating expenses incurred at the Dragon Mine that are not directly related to production activities. Exploration costs, excluding depreciation expense, incurred during 2021 totaled $247,980 compared to $201,234 incurred during 2020, an increase of $46,746.
The Company’s general and administrative expenses are associated with corporate overhead. General and administrative expenses for 2021 totaled $1,594,907 compared to $2,265,805 of expense incurred during the same period in 2020, a decline of $670,898 or 30%. The decline was driven primarily by a (i) $399,121, or 53%, reduction in management salary and benefit expense related to the elimination and consolidation of a number of management positions during 2020, (ii) a $245,811 decrease in director expense, or 43%, (iii) a $115,141 decrease in insurance expense and a (iv) $40,996 decline in office rent expense, partially offset by a $158,740 increase in equity compensation expense related to the granting of equity options to management and directors.
Operating loss incurred during the year was $2,092,529, a decline of $741,117, or 26%, when compared to 2020. The decline in operating loss was driven primarily by the $670,898 decline in general and administrative expense and $528,850 increase in revenue, partially offset by a $412,885 increase in production costs.
Total other expense for 2021 was $1,190,710 compared to $454,065 during the same period in 2020, an increase of $736,645 or 162%. The increase in total other expense was driven primarily by the absence of a $1,300,000 payment received from CMC upon the exercise of an option to purchase the metallic mineral rights of the Dragon Mine in 2020, partially offset by $487,547 of gain related to the forgiveness of two PPP loans and $75,808 in proceeds from the net sale of excess equipment and reimbursements.
Net loss for 2021 was $3,283,239, a decline
$4,472, or 0%, when compared to 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and the use of cash in operating activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s net loss was $3,283,239 and cash used by operating activities was $1,112,254. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had current assets of $270,561 and current liabilities of $3,543,388 of which $372,028 was accrued PIK Note interest to be paid in additional PIK Notes. The Company’s current liabilities also include (i) $717,327 of accrued salaries, severance and related taxes deferred by current and past members of management until the Company’s liquidity improves, (ii) $1,438,311 of accrued directors fee and other director compensation as determined by the Company’s Board, (iii) $119,269 of payables to a compounder for which it has agreed to satisfy in halloysite product and (iv) $47,783 of disputed or erroneously accrued expenses.
Cash used by operating activities in 2021 was $1,112,254 compared to $845,123 of cash provided by operations during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the absence of $1,000,000 of deferred revenue recognized during 2020.
The Company has no cash activities in investing activities during 2021 and 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities during 2021 was $516,947 compared to $228,356 of cash used by financing activities in 2020.
Our total assets as of December 31, 2021 were $1,177,821 compared to $1,900,307 as of December 31, 2020, or an decrease of $722,486. The decrease in total assets was due primarily to a $595,307 decrease in cash.
Management believes that in order for the Company to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations through April 15, 2022 that the Company may be required (i) to raise additional capital either in the form of a private placement of common stock or debt and/or (ii) generate additional sales of its products that will generate sufficient operating profit and cash flows to fund operations. Without additional capital or additional sales of its products, the Company’s ability to continue to operate may be limited.
Based on the Company’s current cash usage expectations, management believes it may not have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations through April 15, 2022. Further, management cannot provide any assurance that it is probable that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to raise debt or equity financing or generate additional product sales. Collectively these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.
