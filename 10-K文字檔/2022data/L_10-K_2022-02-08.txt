Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
Loews Corporation is a holding company and has four reportable segments comprised of three individual consolidated operating subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipelines”) and Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels & Co”); and the Corporate segment. In the first quarter of 2020, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”) was a reportable segment; Diamond Offshore was deconsolidated during the second quarter of 2020. The Corporate segment is primarily comprised of Loews Corporation, excluding its operating subsidiaries, and the operations of Altium Packaging LLC (“Altium Packaging”) through March 31, 2021. On April 1, 2021, Loews Corporation sold 47% of Altium Packaging to GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, for $420 million in cash consideration. As a result of the terms of this transaction, Loews Corporation shares certain participating rights with GIC related to capital allocation and other decisions and was therefore required to deconsolidate Altium Packaging as of the date of the sale under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Subsequent to deconsolidation, Loews Corporation’s investment in Altium Packaging is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with Equity income (loss) reported in Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further information on the deconsolidations of Diamond Offshore and Altium Packaging see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Company” as used herein means Loews Corporation including its consolidated subsidiaries, the terms “Parent Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms as used herein mean Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries, the term “Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation” as used herein means Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation shareholders and the term “subsidiaries” means the Loews Corporation’s consolidated subsidiaries.
We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. For a discussion of changes in results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for Loews Corporation and its subsidiaries see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2021.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Consolidated Financial Results
The following table summarizes net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation by segment and net income (loss) per share attributable to Loews Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(a) Includes a net investment gain of $555 million ($438 million after tax) related to the sale of 47% of Altium Packaging in 2021 and a net investment loss of $1.2 billion ($957 million after tax) caused by the write down of the carrying value of our interest in Diamond Offshore in 2020.
(b) Includes impairment charges of $774 million ($408 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) at Diamond Offshore in the first quarter of 2020, prior to deconsolidation.
2021 Compared with 2020
Net income attributable to Loews Corporation for 2021 was $1.6 billion, or $6.07 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to Loews Corporation of $931 million, or $3.32 per share, in 2020. Excluding the items set forth in footnote (a) in the table above and Diamond Offshore’s 2020 net loss in the table above, net income attributable to Loews Corporation for 2021 and 2020 was $1.1 billion and $502 million.
The improvement in Loews Corporation’s results in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by improved current accident year underwriting results, higher net investment income and investment gains in 2021 as compared to losses in 2020 for CNA and the significant improvement in results for Loews Hotels due to the rebound in leisure travel, especially at resort destinations. Boardwalk Pipelines also contributed positively to Loews Corporation’s year-over-year improvement due to higher revenues from growth projects recently placed into service. The parent company investment portfolio also generated higher gains in 2021 as compared to 2020.
CNA Financial
The following table summarizes the results of operations for CNA for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as presented in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. For further discussion of Net investment income and Investment gains (losses), see the Investments section of this MD&A.
2021 Compared with 2020
Net income attributable to Loews Corporation increased $459 million for 2021 as compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved current accident year underwriting results. Net catastrophe losses were $397 million ($280 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) for 2021 as compared to $550 million ($388 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2020. Net catastrophe losses for 2021 were driven by severe weather related events, primarily Hurricane Ida and Winter Storms Uri and Viola. Net catastrophe losses for 2020 included $294 million related primarily to severe weather-related events, $195 million related to the COVID-19 pandemic and $61 million related to civil unrest. Results also reflect higher net investment income and investment gains in 2021 as compared with investment losses in 2020. Higher net investment income was driven by limited partnership and common stock returns and the improvement in investment gains (losses) was driven by lower impairment losses. Results for 2021 also reflect the absence of a $74 million charge ($52 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the recognition of an active life reserve premium deficiency for long term care policies in 2020.
CNA’s Property & Casualty and Other Insurance Operations
CNA’s commercial property and casualty insurance operations (“Property & Casualty Operations”) include its Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business. CNA’s Other Insurance Operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations include its long term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re, asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”), a legacy portfolio of excess workers’ compensation (“EWC”) policies and certain legacy mass tort reserves. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies, associations, professionals and other groups. We believe the presentation of CNA as one reportable segment is
appropriate in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of the results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to CNA’s Property & Casualty Operations and Other Insurance Operations to enhance the reader’s understanding and to provide further transparency into key drivers of CNA’s financial results.
Effective January 1, 2021, and in connection with the ceding of certain legacy reserves under a retroactive reinsurance agreement executed in February 2021, CNA changed the presentation of a legacy portfolio of excess workers’ compensation policies relating to business written in 2007 and prior. This business, which was previously reported as part of the Commercial business, is now reported as part of the Other Insurance Operations business. For further information on this retroactive reinsurance agreement see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In addition, a determination was made to change the presentation of certain legacy mass tort reserves. Similar to the aforementioned excess workers’ compensation legacy business, these legacy mass tort reserves were previously reported in the Commercial business and are now reported as part of the Other Insurance Operations business. These changes were made to better reflect the manner in which CNA is organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Prior period information has been conformed to the new presentation.
In assessing its insurance operations, CNA utilizes the core income (loss) financial measure. Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss), investment gains or losses and any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance. In addition, core income (loss) excludes the effects of noncontrolling interests. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes investment gains or losses because investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of CNA’s primary insurance operations. Core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure and management believes this measure is useful for investors to evaluate its insurance operations. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation of core income (loss) to net income (loss) that follows in this MD&A.
Property & Casualty Operations
In evaluating the results of Property & Casualty Operations, CNA utilizes the loss ratio, the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio, the combined ratio and the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development excludes net catastrophes losses and changes in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, for prior years from the loss ratio. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders’ dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development is the sum of the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development, the expense ratio and the dividend ratio. In addition, renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business are also utilized in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. For certain products within Small Business, where quantifiable, rate includes the influence of new business as well. Exposure represents the measure of risk used in the pricing of the insurance product. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. Renewal premium change, rate and retention presented for the prior year are updated to reflect subsequent activity on policies written in the period. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers. Gross written premiums, excluding third-party captives, excludes business which is ceded to third-party captives, including business related to large warranty programs.
The following tables summarize the results of CNA’s Property & Casualty Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
2021 Compared with 2020
Gross written premiums, excluding third-party captives, for Specialty increased $376 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 driven by rate and higher new business. Net written premiums for Specialty increased $185 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. The increase in net earned premiums in 2021 was consistent with the trend in net written premiums for Specialty.
Gross written premiums for Commercial increased $359 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 driven by rate and higher new business. Net written premiums for Commercial increased $30 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. Net written premiums for 2021 were unfavorably impacted by the June 1, 2021 written premium catch-up resulting from the addition of the quota share treaty to the property reinsurance program. Excluding the impact of the June 1, 2021 written premium catch-up, net written premiums increased $142 million for 2021 as compared with 2020. Net earned premiums for Commercial increased $229 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. The increase in net earned premiums for 2021 was partially impacted by a reduction in estimated audit premiums related to COVID-19 in 2020 for Commercial.
Gross written premiums for International increased $164 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, gross written premiums increased $104 million driven by rate and higher new business. Net written premiums for International increased $140 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, net written premiums increased $85 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. The increase in net earned premiums in 2021 as compared with 2020 was consistent with the trend in net written premiums for International.
Core income increased $344 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to improved current accident year underwriting results and higher net investment income driven by limited partnership and common stock returns.
Total net catastrophe losses were $397 million in 2021 as compared with $550 million in 2020. For 2021 and 2020 Specialty had net catastrophe losses of $12 million and $125 million, Commercial had net catastrophe losses of $358 million in both years and International had net catastrophe losses of $27 million and $67 million.
Favorable net prior year loss reserve development of $49 million and $70 million was recorded in 2021 and 2020. In 2021 and 2020, Specialty recorded favorable net prior year loss reserve development of $45 million and $61 million, Commercial recorded favorable net prior year loss reserve development of $6 million and $7 million and International recorded unfavorable net prior year loss reserve development of $2 million as compared with favorable net prior year loss reserve development of $2 million. Further information on net prior year loss reserve development is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
Specialty’s combined ratio improved 4.8 points in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to a 4.0 point improvement in the loss ratio and a 0.8 point improvement in the expense ratio. The improvement in the loss ratio was primarily due to lower net catastrophe losses, which were 0.4 points of the loss ratio in 2021, as compared with 4.3 points of the loss ratio in 2020. The improvement in the expense ratio was driven by higher net earned premiums.
Commercial’s combined ratio improved 2.0 points in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to a 1.9 point improvement in the expense ratio. The improvement in the expense ratio was primarily due to higher net earned premiums and lower acquisition costs. Net catastrophe losses were 10.0 points of the loss ratio in 2021, as compared with 10.7 points of the loss ratio in 2020.
International’s combined ratio improved 7.6 points in 2021 as compared with 2020 due to a 5.2 point improvement in the loss ratio and a 2.4 point improvement in the expense ratio. The improvement in the loss ratio was driven by lower net catastrophe losses, which were 2.6 points of the loss ratio in 2021, as compared with 7.1 points of the loss ratio in 2020, and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. The improvement in the expense ratio was driven by lower acquisition costs.
Other Insurance Operations
The following table summarizes the results of CNA’s Other Insurance Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
2021 Compared with 2020
Core results improved $27 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to higher net investment income driven by limited partnership returns. Core results in 2021 included a $31 million favorable impact from the reduction in long term care claim reserves resulting from the annual claim reserve reviews in the third quarter of 2021. Core results in 2020 included a $59 million charge related to the recognition of an active life reserve premium deficiency for long term care policies. The results for 2020 also included a $36 million charge related to an increase in the structured settlement claim reserves, partially offset by a $30 million favorable impact from the reduction in long term care claim reserves, both resulting from the annual claim reserve reviews in the third quarter of 2020.
Core results for 2021 also included expenses related to the March 2021 cybersecurity attack, the recognition of a $12 million loss resulting from the legacy excess workers’ compensation loss portfolio transfer (“EWC LPT”) and higher unfavorable net prior year loss reserve development on legacy mass tort exposures as compared with 2020. The application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to additional cessions to the A&EP Loss Portfolio Transfer (“LPT”) in both periods resulted in charges of $25 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, which have no economic impact. For further information on the A&EP LPT, EWC LPT and net prior year loss reserve development see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Core Income to Net Income
The following table reconciles core income to net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Boardwalk Pipelines
Overview
Boardwalk Pipelines operates in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) industry, providing transportation and storage for those commodities. Boardwalk Pipelines is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and NGLs other than for system management purposes, but changes in natural gas and NGLs prices may impact the volumes of natural gas or NGLs transported and stored by customers on its systems. Due to the capital-intensive nature of its business, Boardwalk Pipelines’ operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the
amount of products transported, with the exception of costs recorded in fuel and transportation expense, which are netted with fuel retained on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further information on Boardwalk Pipelines’ revenue recognition policies see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
Firm Agreements
A substantial portion of Boardwalk Pipelines’ transportation and storage capacity is contracted for under firm agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 89% of Boardwalk Pipelines’ revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees under firm contracts. The table below shows a rollforward of operating revenues under committed firm agreements in place as of December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, including agreements for transportation, storage and other services, over the remaining term of those agreements:
(a)Reflects an increase of $70 million in Boardwalk Pipelines’ actual 2021 revenues recognized from fixed fees under firm agreements as compared with its expected 2021 revenues from fixed fees under firm agreements, including agreements for transportation, storage and other services as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase from contract renewals that occurred in 2021.
During 2021, Boardwalk Pipelines entered into $790 million of new firm agreements, of which approximately 28% were from new growth projects executed in 2021. For firm agreements associated with new growth projects, the associated assets may not be placed into commercial service until sometime in the future. Each year a portion of Boardwalk Pipelines’ firm transportation and storage agreements expire. The rates Boardwalk Pipelines is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available supply, geographical location of natural gas production, the competition between producing basins, competition with other pipelines for supply and markets, the demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market demand for the gas (basis differentials). As of December 31, 2021, Boardwalk Pipelines’ top ten customers holding firm capacity under firm agreements comprised approximately 39% of its total projected operating revenues. Additionally, the credit profile associated with Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers comprising the total projected operating revenues under firm agreements as of December 31, 2021 was 74% rated as investment grade, 10% rated as non-investment grade and 16% not rated.
Pipeline System Maintenance
Boardwalk Pipelines incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related facilities, including those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. These costs are not dependent on the amount of revenues earned from its transportation services. PHMSA has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as HCAs, and MCAs, along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. The HCAs for natural gas pipelines are predicated on high-population density areas (which, for natural gas transmission lines, include Class 3 and 4 areas and, depending on the potential impacts of a risk event, may include Class 1 and 2 areas) whereas HCAs along Boardwalk Pipelines’ NGL pipelines are based on high-population density areas, areas near certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. These regulations have resulted in an overall increase in Boardwalk Pipelines’ ongoing maintenance costs, including maintenance capital and maintenance expense. In 2019, PHMSA issued the first part of its gas Mega Rule, which became effective on July 1, 2020. This regulation imposed numerous requirements, including MAOP reconfirmation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which re-certification process may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested, the periodic assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (in MCAs as well as Class 3 and Class 4 areas), the reporting of exceedances of MAOP and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. In 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that will impose safety regulations related to onshore gas gathering lines and in June 2021, PHMSA
issued an Advisory Bulletin advising pipeline and pipeline facility operators of applicable requirements to update their inspection and maintenance plans for the elimination of hazardous leaks and minimization of natural gas released from pipeline facilities. PHMSA, together with state regulators, is expected to commence inspection of these plans in 2022. It is expected that these new rules will cause Boardwalk Pipelines to incur increased capital and operating costs, experience operational delays and result in potential adverse impacts to its ability to reliably serve its customers as described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report.
Maintenance costs may be capitalized or expensed, depending on the nature of the activities. For any given reporting period, the mix of projects that Boardwalk Pipelines undertakes will affect the amounts we record as property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or recognize as expenses, which impacts earnings. In 2022, Boardwalk Pipelines expects to spend approximately $400 million to maintain its pipeline systems and to comply with new regulatory initiatives previously mentioned, of which approximately $155 million is expected to be maintenance capital. In 2021, Boardwalk Pipelines spent $381 million to maintain its pipeline systems, of which $154 million was recorded as maintenance capital.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes the results of operations for Boardwalk Pipelines for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as presented in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:
2021 Compared with 2020
Total revenues increased $47 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. Including the effect of items in fuel and transportation expense and excluding net proceeds of approximately $34 million in 2020 as a result of drawing on a letter of credit due to a customer bankruptcy in 2020, operating revenues increased $77 million primarily driven by recently completed growth projects and higher utilization based revenues due to higher volumes.
Operating expenses increased $30 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. Excluding items offset with operating revenues, operating expenses increased $26 million, primarily due to an increase in maintenance project costs and an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects. Interest expense decreased $9 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average outstanding long term debt balances.
Loews Hotels & Co
The following table summarizes the results of operations for Loews Hotels & Co for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as presented in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:
2021 Compared with 2020
Loews Hotels & Co’s results have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. By April 2020, most hotel properties owned and/or operated by Loews Hotels & Co had temporarily suspended operations. These hotel properties gradually resumed operations at various times, culminating with all hotels having resumed operations by June 30, 2021. During 2021, overall occupancy rates gradually improved, with hotel properties located in resort destinations improving sooner than hotel properties located in city centers. However, occupancy levels have not reached pre-pandemic levels at many hotels owned and/or operated by Loews Hotels & Co, and business in certain markets continues to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 variants.
Operating revenues improved by $170 million and operating expenses increased by $61 million in 2021 as compared with 2020. This comparison is impacted by robust pre-pandemic business levels prior to mid-March 2020 followed by results that were significantly depressed by the pandemic for the remainder of 2020. Through 2021, occupancy levels have gradually increased leading to improved revenues at all hotel properties, particularly those in resort areas, with operating expense also increasing to support the increased demand levels. As all properties have not resumed all levels of pre-pandemic service offerings, hotel operating expense, including staffing levels, will continue to increase as those resume.
Equity (income) loss from joint ventures improved $120 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, driven by the resumption of operations and associated occupancy improvements primarily at joint venture hotels in resort destinations.
Loews Hotels & Co considers events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of its assets may not be recoverable. In 2021 and 2020, Loews Hotels & Co recorded impairment charges of $10 million and $36 million to reduce the carrying value of certain assets to their estimated fair value.
Other revenues for 2021 included $39 million related to the one-time acceleration of government grant payments, used to retire outstanding debt of an owned hotel prior to maturity and cover certain prepayment costs, and net gains of $8 million
related primarily to the sale of undeveloped land. Other revenues for 2020 included gains of $37 million related to the sales of an owned hotel and an office building.
Interest expense for 2021 increased $3 million as compared with 2020 primarily due to the write off of unamortized issuance costs and the prepayment premium associated with the debt retirement mentioned above.
Corporate
Corporate operations consist primarily of investment income, interest expense and administrative costs at the Parent Company. Investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the Parent Company to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of the trading portfolio held at the Parent Company. Corporate also includes the operating results of Altium Packaging through March 31, 2021 and the equity method accounting for Altium Packaging beginning on April 1, 2021, as a result of the sale of 47% of Altium Packaging and the resulting deconsolidation. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further information.
The following table summarizes the results of operations for Corporate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as presented in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:
2021 Compared with 2020
Net investment income for the Parent Company increased $40 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to improved results from equity based investments, partially offset by lower average yields on short term investments.
Investment gains of $540 million in 2021 were primarily due to a gain of $555 million ($438 million after tax) on the sale of 47% of Altium Packaging. Investment losses of $1.2 billion ($957 million after tax) for 2020 was due to the loss recognized upon deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore as a result of its Chapter 11 Filing.
Operating revenues and other for 2021 include Altium Packaging revenues of $280 million prior to its deconsolidation on April 1, 2021 and $1,022 million for 2020.
Operating and other expenses decreased in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily due to the deconsolidation of Altium Packaging on April 1, 2021. Operating and other expenses for Altium Packaging were $300 million in 2021 and $992 million in 2020. Operating and other expenses also include legal and other corporate overhead expenses at the Parent Company.
Interest expenses decreased $13 million in 2021 as compared with 2020, primarily due to the deconsolidation of Altium Packaging on April 1, 2021, partially offset by the May 2020 issuance of the Parent Company’s $500 million 3.2% senior notes and a charge of approximately $14 million to write off debt issuance costs for the early retirement of debt at Altium Packaging in the first quarter of 2021.
Income tax expense includes the recognition of a $40 million deferred tax liability related to the sale of Altium Packaging.
Diamond Offshore
Amounts presented for Diamond Offshore for 2020 only include the period through its deconsolidation on April 26, 2020. Contract drilling revenues and contract drilling expenses were $287 million and $254 million for this 2020 period. Results for 2020 also include an aggregate asset impairment charge of $774 million ($408 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) recognized in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further information.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Parent Company
Parent Company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2020. In 2021, we received $853 million in cash dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special cash dividend of $182 million from CNA and a $199 million cash dividend from Altium Packaging in connection with a debt recapitalization prior to its deconsolidation on April 1, 2021. Cash outflows in 2021 included the payment of $1.1 billion to fund treasury stock purchases, $65 million of cash dividends to our shareholders and $32 million of cash contributions to Loews Hotels & Co. On April 1, 2021, we sold 47% of Altium Packaging to GIC and received $420 million in cash consideration. In March of 2022, we will receive cash dividends of $584 million from CNA. As a holding company we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries and returns on our investment portfolio to fund our obligations. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of our debt and equity securities from time to time. We are not responsible for the liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries and there are no Parent Company guarantees.
Depending on market and other conditions, we may purchase our shares and shares of our subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. In 2021, we purchased 21.1 million shares of Loews Corporation common stock. As of February 4, 2022, we had purchased an additional 0.2 million shares of Loews Corporation common stock in 2022 at an aggregate cost of $14 million. As of February 4, 2022, there were 248,202,443 shares of Loews Corporation common stock outstanding.
Loews Corporation has a corporate credit and senior debt rating of A with a stable outlook from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), a senior debt rating of A3 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and a senior debt rating of A with a stable outlook from Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”).
Future uses of our cash may include investing in our subsidiaries, new acquisitions, dividends and/or repurchases of our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, financial condition and business needs.
Subsidiaries
CNA’s cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in net premiums collected and lower net claim payments, which were impacted by a slowdown in court dockets. These items were partially offset by the payment of the EWC LPT premium. For further information on the EWC LPT see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
CNA paid cash dividends of $2.27 per share on its common stock, including a special cash dividend of $0.75 per share in 2021. On February 4, 2022, CNA’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share and a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share payable March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record on February 22, 2022. CNA’s declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA’s earnings, financial condition, business needs and regulatory constraints. The payment of dividends by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments.
Dividends from Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), a subsidiary of CNA, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the “Department”), are determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2021, CCC was in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2022 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is $1.2 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of $880 million in 2021. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.

Certain of the hotels wholly or partially owned by subsidiaries of Loews Hotels & Co are financed by debt facilities, with a number of different lenders. Each of the loan agreements underlying these facilities contain a variety of financial and operational covenants. As a result of the impacts of COVID-19, Loews Hotels & Co has proactively requested certain lenders, where applicable, to (1) temporarily waive certain covenants to avoid an event of default and/or further restriction of the hotel’s cash balances through the establishment of lockboxes and other measures; (2) temporarily allow funds previously restricted directly or indirectly under the hotel’s underlying loan agreement for the renewal, replacement and addition of building improvements, furniture and fixtures to be used instead for hotel operations and maintenance; and/or (3) defer certain interest and/or principal payments while the hotels operations were temporarily suspended or significantly impacted by a decline in occupancy. Loews Hotels & Co also continues to work with lenders on loans that are being reviewed for extension. These discussions with lenders are ongoing and may require Loews Hotels & Co to make principal paydowns, establish restricted cash reserves or provide guaranties of a subsidiary’s debt to otherwise avoid an event of default. Through the date of this Report, none of Loews Hotels & Co’s subsidiaries is in default on any of its loans.
As of December 31, 2021, Loews Hotels & Co has loans that mature within twelve months and is actively working with lenders to refinance $93 million in current maturities of long-term debt.
In October 2021 Loews Hotels & Co announced the development of the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center in Arlington, Texas. The hotel, for which Loews Hotels & Co will serve as manager and hold a majority equity interest, is expected to open in early 2024 with approximately 888 guestrooms and over 250,000 square feet of function space. The
approximately $550 million hotel project will be funded initially through a mix of partner contributions before drawing on a $300 million construction loan in the second half of 2022. Based on the timing of construction relative to the seasonality of Loews Hotels & Co’s business and restrictions on certain cash held by Loews Hotels & Co, a Loews Corporation capital contribution may be required to fund all or part Loews Hotels & Co’s partner contributions.
In 2021, Loews Hotels & Co received capital contributions of $32 million from Loews Corporation.

Further information on our commitments, contingencies and guarantees is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
INVESTMENTS
Investment activities of our non-insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of investments in fixed income securities, including short term investments. The Parent Company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and investments in limited partnerships. Certain of these types of investments generally have greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within Results of Operations - Corporate.
The Parent Company enters into short sales and invests in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to its portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to seek to ensure that open positions are consistent with the portfolio strategy.
Credit exposure associated with non-performance by counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The risk of non-performance is mitigated by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives by using multiple counterparties. Collateral is occasionally required from derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.
Insurance
CNA maintains a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array
of asset classes. CNA’s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability.
Net Investment Income
The significant components of CNA’s net investment income are presented in the following table. Fixed income securities, as presented, include both fixed maturity securities and non-redeemable preferred stock.
CNA’s net investment income increased $224 million in 2021 as compared with 2020 driven by higher limited partnership and common stock returns partially offset by lower yields in the fixed income portfolio.
Investment Gains (Losses)
The components of CNA’s investment gains (losses) are presented in the following table:
CNA’s investment gains (losses) improved $155 million in 2021 as compared with 2020, driven by lower impairment losses.
Further information on CNA’s investment gains and losses is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
Portfolio Quality
The following table presents the estimated fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of CNA’s fixed maturity securities by rating distribution:
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 1% of CNA’s fixed maturity portfolio was rated internally. AAA rated securities included $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion of pre-refunded municipal bonds as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table presents CNA’s available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in a gross unrealized loss position by ratings distribution:
The following table presents the maturity profile for these available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. Securities not due to mature on a single date are allocated based on weighted average life:
Duration
A primary objective in the management of CNA’s investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to the corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions as well as domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector.
A further consideration in the management of CNA’s investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in Other Insurance Operations.
The effective durations of CNA’s fixed income securities and short term investments are presented in the following table. Amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.
CNA’s investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. Certain securities have duration characteristics that are variable based on market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that may drive variability in the amount and timing of cash flows. Additionally, CNA periodically reviews the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is included in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included under
