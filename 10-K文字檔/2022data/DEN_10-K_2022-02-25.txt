Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information. Our discussion and analysis includes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K, along with Forward-Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 5, 2021.
As a result of the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh start accounting on September 18, 2020 (the “Emergence Date”), certain values and operational results of the consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 18, 2020 are not comparable to those in the Company’s consolidated financial statements prior to, and including September 18, 2020. The Emergence Date fair values of the Successor’s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values as reflected on the historical balance sheets of the Predecessor contained in periodic reports previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. References to “Successor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company subsequent to September 18, 2020, and references to “Predecessor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 18, 2020.
OVERVIEW
Denbury is an independent energy company with operations focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions. The Company is differentiated by our focus on CO2 EOR and the emerging CCUS industry, supported by the Company’s CO2 EOR technical and operational expertise and extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, making the Company’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions negative today, with a goal to also fully offset our Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions within this decade, primarily through increasing the amount of captured industrial-sourced CO2 used in our operations.
Oil Price Impact on Our Business. Our financial results are significantly impacted by changes in oil prices, as 97% of our sales volumes are oil. Changes in oil prices impact all aspects of our business, most notably our cash flows from operations, revenues, capital and budgeting decisions, and oil and natural gas reserves volumes. The table below outlines selected financial items and sales volumes, along with our realized oil prices, before and after commodity derivative impacts, over the last three years:
Over the last several years, NYMEX oil prices have been extremely volatile, reaching a three-year peak over $84 per Bbl in October 2021 compared to lows averaging $17 per Bbl in April 2020. The year-to-year volatility has been due to the reduction in worldwide economic activity and oil demand amid the COVID-19 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, plus OPEC supply pressures. NYMEX WTI oil prices strengthened from an average of approximately $39 per Bbl in 2020 to $68 per Bbl during 2021, reaching highs over $84 per Bbl in late-October 2021, followed by oil prices plunging in late November 2021 upon

identification of the new Omicron variant of COVID-19, with NYMEX oil prices recovering in early 2022 to new seven year highs of $95.46 per barrel as of February 23, 2022.
As reflected in the table above, in 2021, our oil and natural gas sales increased by $466.7 million, or 67%, over 2020 levels due to rising oil prices; however, after considering the significant payments made upon settlements under our commodity derivative contracts, our oil and natural gas sales net of hedging settlements increased only $87.0 million. Upon emergence from bankruptcy in September 2020, we were required to hedge through mid-2022 certain levels of estimated production under our post-emergence bank credit facility, which significantly limited our ability to fully benefit from the significant oil price recovery in 2021. Although we were required to hedge a certain percentage of our production in the first half of 2022, that percentage is less than in 2021. Additionally, our hedges in 2022, on average, are at more favorable prices and with a greater mix of collars, providing us more upside price exposure. We currently have no further hedging requirements under our bank credit facility.
Comparative Financial Results and Highlights. We recognized net income of $56.0 million, or $1.04 per diluted common share, during 2021. As a result of Denbury filing for bankruptcy and emerging from bankruptcy during September 2020, our 2020 financial results are broken out between the Predecessor period (January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020) and the Successor period (September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020). For the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020, we recognized a net loss of $1.4 billion, and for the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, we recognized a net loss of $50.7 million. The principal determinants of our comparative annual results between 2020 and 2021 were (a) an $850.0 million charge for reorganization items, net, during the prior-year Predecessor period, primarily consisting fresh start accounting adjustments and (b) a $996.7 million full cost pool ceiling test write-down during the prior-year Predecessor period. Additional drivers of the comparative operating results between full-year 2021 and 2020 include the following:
•Oil and natural gas revenues increased by $466.7 million (67%), with 72% of the increase due to higher commodity prices, slightly offset by lower sales volumes;
•Commodity derivative expense increased by $393.1 million consisting of a $379.7 million decrease in cash receipts upon contract settlements ($277.2 million in payments during 2021 compared to $102.5 million in receipts upon settlements during 2020) and a $13.4 million increase in noncash fair value losses between periods;
•Depletion, depreciation, and amortization expense decreased $83.8 million primarily due to lower depletable costs due to the step down in book value resulting from fresh start accounting as of September 18, 2020 and an accelerated depreciation charge of $39.2 million during 2020 related to unevaluated properties; and
•Lease operating expenses increased by $73.0 million (21%), primarily due to an increase of $25.9 million related to the March 2021 Wind River Basin acquisition and higher expenses across nearly all lease operating expense categories, largely driven by higher commodity prices and increased workover activity.
March 2021 Acquisition of Wyoming CO2 EOR Fields. On March 3, 2021, we acquired a nearly 100% working interest (approximately 83% net revenue interest) in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek EOR fields (collectively “Wind River Basin”) located in Wyoming, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO2 transportation pipeline to the acquired fields. The acquisition purchase price was $10.9 million cash (after final closing adjustments) plus two contingent $4 million cash payments if NYMEX WTI oil prices average at least $50 per Bbl during each of 2021 and 2022. We made the first contingent payment in January 2022 and if the price condition is met, the second $4 million payment will be due in January 2023. As of December 31, 2021, the contingent consideration was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value of $7.7 million, a $2.4 million increase from the March 2021 acquisition date fair value. This $2.4 million increase at December 31, 2021 was the result of higher NYMEX WTI oil prices and was recorded to “Other expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Wind River Basin sales averaged approximately 2,879 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the CO2 flood utilizes 100% industrial-sourced CO2.
Cedar Creek Anticline CO2 Pipeline Completion. During 2021, we spent $123.4 million, approximately 49% of our development capital expenditures, on Cedar Creek Anticline (“CCA”) pipeline construction and tertiary development. We completed the 105-mile CO2 pipeline from Bell Creek to CCA, along with an additional pipeline lateral that will service the initial EOR development and additional future phases. First CO2 injections in CCA’s Red River formation commenced in early February 2022, and tertiary oil production response is anticipated in the second half of 2023.

Divestiture of Hartzog Draw Deep Mineral Rights. On June 30, 2021, we closed the sale of undeveloped, unconventional deep mineral rights in Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming. The cash proceeds of $18 million reduced our full cost pool; therefore, no gain or loss was recorded on the transaction, and the sale had no impact on our production or reserves.
Houston Area Land Sales. During the second half of 2021, we completed the sales of a portion of certain non-producing surface acreage in the Houston area. We received cash proceeds of $15.2 million from the sales and recognized a $10.3 million gain to “Other income” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Advancing Carbon Capture, Use and Storage. CCUS is a process that captures CO2 from industrial sources and reuses it or stores the CO2 in geologic formations in order to avoid its release into the atmosphere. We utilize CO2 from industrial sources in our EOR operations, and our extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure and operations, particularly in the Gulf Coast, are strategically located in close proximity to large sources of industrial emissions. We believe that the assets and technical expertise required for CCUS are highly aligned with our existing CO2 EOR operations, providing us with a significant advantage and opportunity to participate in the emerging CCUS industry, as the building of a permanent carbon sequestration business requires both time and capital to build assets such as those we own and have been operating for years. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of the CO2 utilized in our oil and gas operations was industrial-sourced CO2, and we anticipate this percentage could increase in the future as supportive U.S. government policy and public pressure on industrial CO2 emitters will provide strong incentives for these entities to capture their CO2 emissions.
As we seek to grow our CCUS business and pursue new CCUS opportunities, we have been engaged in discussions with existing and potential third-party industrial CO2 emitters regarding transportation and storage solutions, while also identifying potential future sequestration sites and landowners of those locations. We continue to make progress in these discussions and have executed several term sheets for the future transportation and sequestration of CO2. While EOR is the only CCUS operation reflected in our current and historical financial and operational results (as a cost), we believe the incentives offered under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 45Q”) or otherwise will drive demand for CCUS and will allow us to collect a fee for the transportation and storage of captured industrial-sourced CO2, including CO2 utilized in our EOR operations. As the enhanced Section 45Q regulations are relatively new, it will likely take several years to construct new capture facilities and for dedicated storage sites to be developed. We believe our existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure, EOR operations, and experience and expertise in working with CO2 all position us to be a leader in this rapidly developing industry.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
Overview. Our primary sources of capital and liquidity are our cash flows from operations and availability of borrowing capacity under our senior secured bank credit facility. Our most significant cash outlays relate to our development capital expenditures, and in 2021 the repayment of $70.0 million of pipeline financing obligations associated with the NEJD pipeline system. At December 31, 2021, we had $35.0 million of borrowings outstanding on our $575 million senior secured bank credit facility, leaving us with $528.1 million of borrowing capacity after consideration of $11.9 million of letters of credit outstanding. Our borrowing base availability, coupled with unrestricted cash of $3.7 million provides us total liquidity of $531.8 million as of December 31, 2021, which is more than adequate to meet our anticipated near-term operating and capital needs.
As further discussed below, based on oil price futures as of the middle of February 2022, we currently anticipate funding all of our 2022 capital budget from projected operating cash flow while also generating excess cash flow. The ultimate level of excess cash we may generate will be highly dependent on oil prices and many other factors, but we currently plan to utilize our excess cash to build cash for anticipated CCUS capital needs over the next several years, as we believe that the potential exists for our CCUS business to grow to a significant scale. During 2022, we will continue to evaluate anticipated capital needs for our CCUS business in relation to our excess cash flow, and therefore, at the current time, our first priority is to utilize and build cash for CCUS growth rather than returning capital to stockholders.
2021 Cash Sources and Uses. During 2021, we generated cash flows from operations of $317.2 million, while incurring development capital expenditures of $252.2 million and capitalized interest of $4.6 million, resulting in approximately $55 million of cash flow in excess of capital expenditures (excluding working capital changes). In addition, we paid $70.0 million to Genesis Energy, L.P. in accordance with the October 2020 restructuring of the financing arrangements of our NEJD CO2 pipeline system and acquired our Wind River Basin properties in Wyoming for $10.9 million during 2021. These supplemental cash outflows were partially offset with $18 million of proceeds from the sale of undeveloped, unconventional deep mineral

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
rights at Hartzog Draw Field in June 2021 and $15.2 million of proceeds during the second half of 2021 from sales of non-producing surface acreage primarily around the Houston area. Average outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility during 2021 were $85.0 million.
Capital Expenditure Summary. Our 2021 capital expenditures for CCA tertiary development and pipeline construction totaled $123.4 million, or 49% of our 2021 development capital expenditures. The following table reflects incurred capital expenditures (including accrued capital) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
(1)Capital expenditures in this summary are presented on an as-incurred basis (including accruals), and are $36.6 million higher than the capital expenditures in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows which are presented on a cash paid basis.
(2)Includes capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs and pre-production tertiary startup costs.
(3)Primarily consists of working interest positions in the Wind River Basin enhanced oil recovery fields acquired on March 3, 2021.
Supply Chain Issues and Potential Cost Inflation. Recent U.S. supply chain constraints, together with tight labor markets, could increase our costs in 2022 and future periods. Most of the cost inflation pressures we experienced during late 2021 were tied to rising fuel and power costs in our operations but were not material to our 2021 financial results. We have increased our 2022 operational budget for anticipated inflation and have taken steps to build our on-hand supply stock for items frequently used in our operations to address possible supply chain disruptions.
2022 Plans and Capital Budget. We estimate that our total oil and natural gas development capital expenditures in 2022, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest, will be in a range of $290 million to $320 million, which at the midpoint includes approximately $115 million for CCA’s new EOR development (inclusive of an estimated $25 million of pre-production CO2 costs) and $190 million for other tertiary and non-tertiary oil-focused development projects, capitalized internal costs and CO2 sources and pipelines. This compares to total oil and natural gas development expenditures of $252.2 million in 2021, of which $123.4 million was for CCA’s new EOR development and $128.8 million for our other tertiary and non-tertiary development, capitalized internal costs, and CO2 sources and other CO2 pipelines. We continue to work on the timing of development plans at CCA and have increased our 2022 planned activities over our previously anticipated level to now include a CO2 pilot in the Pennel area of CCA.
In addition to our budgeted oil and natural gas capital investments, we anticipate spending approximately $50 million in connection with our CCUS strategic priorities, potentially raising our 2022 total estimated capital range to between $340 million and $370 million. Based on oil prices as of the middle of February 2022, the Company’s hedge positions and other projections, we estimate that our 2022 cash flows from operations should exceed our budgeted level of capital expenditures.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Also, at December 31, 2021, we had $528.1 million of availability under our bank credit facility, which we believe is more than adequate to cover any near-term liquidity needs.
Based on our capital spending plans, we currently anticipate 2022 average daily production will be between 46,000 BOE/d and 49,000 BOE/d. Our anticipated 2022 production level compares to 2021 average production of 48,770 BOE/d.
Senior Secured Bank Credit Agreement. In September 2020, we entered into a bank credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (the “Bank Credit Agreement”). The Bank Credit Agreement is a senior secured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base and lender commitments of $575 million, under which we had $35.0 million borrowed as of December 31, 2021, leaving us with $528.1 million of availability after consideration of $11.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. Availability under the Bank Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which is redetermined semiannually on or around May 1 and November 1 of each year, with our next scheduled redetermination around May 1, 2022. The borrowing base is adjusted at the lenders’ discretion and is based, in part, upon external factors over which we have no control. The borrowing base is subject to a reduction by twenty-five percent (25%) of the principal amount of any unsecured or subordinated debt issued or incurred. The borrowing base may also be reduced if we sell borrowing base properties and/or cancel commodity derivative positions with an aggregate value in excess of 5% of the then-effective borrowing base between redeterminations. The Bank Credit Agreement matures on January 30, 2024.
The Bank Credit Agreement limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make other restricted payments in an amount not to exceed “Distributable Free Cash Flow”, but only if (1) no event of default or borrowing base deficiency exists; (2) our total leverage ratio is 2 to 1 or lower; and (3) availability under the Bank Credit Agreement is at least 20%. The Bank Credit Agreement also limits our ability to, among other things, incur and repay other indebtedness; grant liens; engage in certain mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; engage in sales of assets; make acquisitions and investments; make other restricted payments (including redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our common stock); and enter into commodity derivative agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions.
The Bank Credit Agreement contains certain financial performance covenants including the following:
•A Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX covenant (as defined in the agreement), with such ratio not to exceed 3.5 times; and
•A requirement to maintain a current ratio (i.e., Consolidated Current Assets to Consolidated Current Liabilities) of 1.0.
For purposes of computing the current ratio per the Bank Credit Agreement, Consolidated Current Assets exclude the current portion of derivative assets but include available borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement, and Consolidated Current Liabilities exclude the current portion of derivative liabilities as well as the current portions of long-term indebtedness outstanding. Under these financial performance covenant calculations, as of December 31, 2021, our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDAX was 0.10 to 1.0 (with a maximum permitted ratio of 3.5 to 1.0) and our current ratio was 2.58 to 1.0 (with a required ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0). Based upon our currently forecasted levels of production and costs, hedges in place as of February 23, 2022, and current oil commodity futures prices, we currently anticipate continuing to be in compliance with our financial performance covenants during the foreseeable future.
The above description of our Bank Credit Agreement is qualified by the express language and defined terms contained in the Bank Credit Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to our Form 8-K Report filed with the SEC on September 18, 2020.
Commitments, Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $11.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured bank credit facility. Additionally, we have obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry, none of which are recorded on our balance sheet. Certain of these capital spending plans are further described in 2022 Plans and Capital Budget above. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs estimated in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs, see Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements.
Our periodic obligations include operational expenses that we anticipate being paid out of our cash flow from sale of production, plus the capital expenditures detailed above. In addition to these periodic expenditures, we have various future cash
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2021. The most material of these commitments within the next 12 months include:
•Approximately $46 million under contracts for the purchase of CO2 captured from industrial sources and for processing fees related to our overriding royalty interest in the CO2 at LaBarge Field, both of which are used in our tertiary recovery activities, assuming a $70 per Bbl NYMEX oil price. The commitment level declines in 2023 and again in 2028 due to the expiration of certain industrial-CO2 purchase commitments (see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion); and
•Approximately $6 million in operating lease obligations (see Note 5, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).
In addition to these commitments, we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees; software maintenance; subscriptions; and other overhead-type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. Most of these recurring expenditures could be quickly canceled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for our ongoing normal operations. Other commitments include certain transportation agreements and well-related costs. Our longer-term commitments that extend beyond the next 12 months include the following:
•Obligations and periodic interest payments under our senior secured bank credit facility, which matures on January 30, 2024, and of which $35.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2021; and
•Asset retirement obligations related to future costs associated with plugging and abandoning our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells, removing equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and returning land to its original condition (see Note 6, Asset Retirement Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements).
As detailed throughout this report, the largest determinant of our cash flow is the oil price we receive. Oil prices and cash flow are highly impacted by worldwide oil supply and fluctuations in demand due to economic activity, which volatility we attempt to offset to some extent with our hedging program. The variability of proceeds from the sale of our production is partially offset by similar directional variances in certain expenses, including a portion of our lease operating expenses and production taxes, as these expenses correlate to some degree with changes in oil prices.
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW OF TERTIARY OPERATIONS
Our tertiary operations represent a significant portion of our overall operations. The economics of a tertiary field and the related impact on our financial statements differ from a conventional oil and gas play and are explained further below.
While it is difficult to accurately forecast future production, we believe our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long-term production growth potential at reasonable return metrics, with relatively low risk, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects. We have been developing tertiary oil properties for over 22 years, and the financial impact of such operations is reflected in our historical financial statements. The summary below highlights our observations regarding how tertiary operations have impacted our financial statements.
Finding and Development Costs. We currently expect finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding CO2 pipeline infrastructure capital expenditures) over the life of each field to be competitive with the industry average costs for other oil properties. See the definition of finding and development costs in the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations.
Timing of Capital Costs. When initiating a new tertiary flood, there generally is a delay between the initial capital expenditures and the resulting production increases. We must build facilities, and often a CO2 pipeline to the field, before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences). For certain fields such as those in CCA, we estimate it could take up to 18 months or longer for a tertiary production response to occur. Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proved reserves from fields we flood and, even after a field has proved reserves, significant amounts of additional capital will usually be required to fully develop the field.
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Recognition of Proved Reserves. In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood. The magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods, the timing of the production response from new floods and the performance of our existing floods.
Production Rates. The production rate at a tertiary flood can vary from quarter to quarter, as a tertiary field’s production may increase rapidly when wells respond to the CO2, plateau temporarily, and then resume growth as additional areas of the field are developed. During a tertiary flood life cycle, facility capacity is increased from time to time, which occasionally requires temporary shutdowns during installation, thereby causing temporary declines in production. We also find it difficult to precisely predict when any given well will respond to the injected CO2, as the CO2 seldom travels through the rock consistently due to heterogeneity in the oil-bearing formations. We find all of these fluctuations to be normal and generally expect oil production at a tertiary field to increase over time until the field is fully developed, albeit sometimes in inconsistent patterns.
Operating Costs. Tertiary projects may be more expensive to operate than traditional industry operations because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the cost of the CO2 and the significant energy requirements to re-compress the CO2 back into a near-liquid state for re-injection purposes). The costs of our CO2 and the electricity required to recycle and inject this CO2 comprise over half of our typical tertiary operating expenses. Since these costs vary along with commodity and commercial electricity prices, they are highly variable and will increase in a high-commodity-price environment and decrease in a low-price environment. The cost of purchasing and/or producing CO2 for use in tertiary floods is allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses (following the commencement of tertiary oil production) at the time the CO2 is injected. These costs have historically represented approximately 20% to 25% of the total operating costs for our tertiary operations. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), operating costs per barrel for a new flood will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time.

Sales Volumes
Average daily sales volumes by area for 2021, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the quarters of 2021, is shown below:
(1)Includes Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Little Creek, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb, Soso and West Yellow Creek fields.
(2)Includes tertiary sales volumes related to our working interest positions in the Wind River Basin properties acquired on March 3, 2021, as well as Salt Creek and Grieve fields.
(3)Includes non-tertiary sales volumes from Wind River Basin, as well as Hartzog Draw and Bell Creek fields.
(4)Includes non-tertiary sales related to the March 2020 sale of 50% of our working interests in Webster, Thompson, Manvel, and East Hastings fields (the “Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale”).
Total sales volumes during 2021 averaged 48,770 BOE/d, including 32,781 Bbls/d from tertiary properties and 15,989 BOE/d from non-tertiary properties. This sales volume represents a decrease of 2,187 BOE/d (4%) compared to 2020 continuing sales volumes which excludes sales volumes related to our Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale in March 2020. The year-over-year decline was primarily impacted by (1) the carryover impact of exceptionally low levels of capital investment over the past several years and development spending in 2021 below levels required to hold production flat (excluding new EOR development at CCA) and (2) decreases at CCA due to the net profits interest of a third party, whereby increased oil prices have resulted in increased profitability and thus, reducing sales volumes net to Denbury by approximately 360 BOE/d when

compared to 2020, partially offset by sales increases from our Wind River Basin enhanced oil recovery fields acquired on March 3, 2021. Our production during 2021 was 97% oil, consistent with 2020 and 2019.
Oil and Natural Gas Revenues
Oil and natural gas revenues increased 67% between 2020 and 2021 and decreased 43% between 2019 and 2020. The changes in our oil and natural gas revenues are due to changes in production quantities and realized commodity prices (excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts), as reflected in the following table:
Excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts, our average net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality, and location differentials.
•Gulf Coast Region. Our average NYMEX oil differential in the Gulf Coast region was a negative $1.42 per Bbl in 2021 and a negative $1.14 per Bbl during 2020. NYMEX WTI oil prices continued to strengthen during 2021; however, the pricing for our Gulf Coast grades weakened relative to NYMEX WTI index prices. For our crude oil sold under Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) index prices, the LLS-to-NYMEX differential averaged a positive $1.49 per Bbl on a trade-month basis during 2021, compared to a positive $2.12 per Bbl differential during 2020.
•Rocky Mountain Region. NYMEX oil differentials in the Rocky Mountain region averaged $1.32 per Bbl below NYMEX during 2021, compared to an average differential of $2.80 per Bbl below NYMEX in 2020. Differentials in the Rocky Mountain region can fluctuate with regional supply and demand trends and can fluctuate significantly on a

month-to-month basis due to weather, refinery or transportation issues, and Canadian and U.S. crude oil price index volatility.
CO2 Revenues and Expenses
We sell a portion of the CO2 we produce from Jackson Dome to third-party industrial users at various contracted prices primarily under long-term contracts. We recognize the revenue received on these CO2 sales as “CO2 sales and transportation fees” with the corresponding costs recognized as “CO2 operating and discovery expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. CO2 sales and transportation fees were $44.2 million during 2021, compared to $30.5 million during the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase from the prior-year period was primarily due to new contracts and an increase in CO2 sales volumes to our industrial CO2 customers.
Oil Marketing Revenues and Purchases
In certain situations, we purchase and subsequently sell oil from third parties. We recognize the revenue received and the associated expenses incurred on these sales on a gross basis as “Oil marketing revenues” and “Oil marketing purchases” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
We have routinely entered into oil derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows. These contracts have historically consisted of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps, fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put, and basis swaps.
The following tables summarize the impact our commodity derivative contracts had on our operating results for the periods indicated:
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Changes in our commodity derivatives expense during 2021 were primarily related to the expiration of commodity derivative contracts, new commodity derivative contracts entered into for future periods, and to the changes in oil futures prices between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The benefit of the significant increase in our oil sales during 2021 over 2020 sales levels due to rising oil prices has been offset by payments on settlement of commodity derivative contracts, principally due to the strike prices of our fixed-price swaps which were entered into in late 2020 based on the hedging requirements we were obligated to meet under our bank credit facility entered into upon emergence from Chapter 11 restructuring. During 2021, we paid $277.2 million upon expiration of commodity derivative contracts, compared to cash receipts upon settlement of $102.5 million during 2020. The period-to-period changes reflect the very large fluctuation in oil prices between March 2020 ($30.45 per barrel), when worldwide financial markets were beginning to absorb the potential impact of a global pandemic, and December 2021 ($71.69 per barrel) as prospects for increased economic activity and oil demand improved.
In order to provide a level of price protection to our oil production, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2023 using NYMEX fixed-price swaps and costless collars. Relative to 2021, our current hedge levels are significantly lower in 2022 and 2023, and we are hedged at more favorable prices and with a greater mix of collars, allowing us to benefit from additional upside in oil prices to a greater degree. We have no further hedging requirements under our bank credit facility. See Note 12, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of our outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 2021, and Market Risk Management below for additional discussion. In addition, the following table summarizes our oil derivative contracts as of February 23, 2022:
Based on current contracts in place and NYMEX oil futures prices as of February 23, 2022, which averaged approximately $87 per Bbl for the remainder of 2022, we currently expect that we would make cash payments of approximately $250 million during 2022 upon settlement of these contracts, the amount of which is dependent upon fluctuations in future NYMEX oil prices in relation to the prices of our 2022 fixed-price swaps which have a weighted average NYMEX oil price of $52.28 per Bbl and weighted average ceiling prices of our 2022 collars of $65.85 per Bbl. See Note 12, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Changes in commodity prices, expiration of contracts, and new commodity contracts entered into cause fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our oil derivative contracts. Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the period-to-period changes in the fair value of these contracts, as outlined above, are recognized in our statements of operations.
Production Expenses
Lease Operating Expenses
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Total lease operating expenses were $424.6 million, or $23.85 per BOE, during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $351.5 million, or $18.78 per BOE, for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The $73.0 million increase on an absolute-dollar basis was primarily due to $25.9 million of expense during the 2021 period related to the Wind River Basin acquisition in March 2021, with the remainder largely spread across all expense categories but reflective of the different oil price environments in 2020 and 2021. During 2020, we curtailed production for a short period of time and significantly reduced workover costs due to the extremely low oil price environment. In 2021, workover activity increased as oil prices improved, and we returned to a more normal activity level. Lease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $16.1 million benefit resulting from compensation under certain of the Company’s power agreements for power interruption during the severe winter storm in February 2021 which created widespread power outages in Texas and disrupted the Company’s operations.
We currently expect lease operating expenses during 2022 to increase on an absolute-dollar and per-BOE basis as a result of CO2 and power expenses correlated with higher oil and natural gas prices; inflationary impacts across numerous cost categories such as contract labor, chemicals, and workovers; the 2022 period reflecting a full year’s worth of operating expenses for our Wind River Basin properties; and the absence of a one-time $16.1 million benefit during the 2021 period related to power agreements.
Transportation and Marketing Expenses
Transportation and marketing expenses primarily consist of amounts incurred related to the transportation, marketing, and processing of oil and natural gas production. Transportation and marketing expenses were $28.8 million during 2021, compared to $37.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease between periods was primarily due to changes to a portion of our transportation agreements in the Rocky Mountain region during the third quarter of 2021 to begin selling our production at Guernsey, Wyoming versus Cushing, Oklahoma and due to lower sales volumes during 2021.
Taxes Other than Income
Taxes other than income, which includes production, ad valorem and franchise taxes, were $91.4 million during 2021, compared to $60.1 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase between periods was primarily due to an increase in production taxes resulting from higher oil and natural gas revenues.
General and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Our G&A expense on an absolute-dollar basis was $79.3 million during 2021, compared to $68.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in our G&A expenses during 2021 was primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the vesting of performance-based equity awards granted in late 2020, as well as being due to a full year of expense for restricted stock unit awards also granted in late 2020. Although the performance criteria for these performance-based equity awards were met in 2021, the shares are not currently outstanding as actual delivery of the shares is not scheduled to occur until after the end of the performance period, December 4, 2023. We expect stock compensation expense will be lower in 2022 as future performance awards will be more traditional in nature and will be expensed over a longer time period.
Interest and Financing Expenses
(1)Cash interest during the Predecessor periods includes the portion of interest on certain debt instruments accounted for as a reduction of debt for GAAP financial reporting purposes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“FASC”) 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors. The portion of interest treated as a reduction of debt was related to the Predecessor’s 9% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) and 9¼% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019. Amounts related to the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes remaining in future interest payable were written-off to “Reorganization items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on July 30, 2020 (the “Petition Date”).
(2)Represents amortization of debt discounts related to the 7¾% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2024 (the “7¾% Senior Secured Notes”) and 6⅜% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”) during the Predecessor period January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. Remaining debt discounts were written-off to “Reorganization items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the Petition Date.
(3)Excludes debt discounts related to the Predecessor’s 7¾% Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Convertible Notes.
(4)Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discount.
Cash interest was $6.0 million during 2021, compared to $111.1 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease between periods was primarily due to a decrease in the average debt principal outstanding, with the Successor periods reflecting the full extinguishment of all outstanding obligations under the senior secured second lien notes, convertible senior notes, and senior subordinated notes on the Emergence Date, pursuant to the terms of the prepackaged joint plan of reorganization (the “Plan”), relieving us of approximately $2.1 billion of debt by issuing equity and/or warrants in the Successor period to the holders of that debt.

Depletion, Depreciation, and Amortization (“DD&A”)
(1)Represents an accelerated depreciation charge related to capitalized amounts associated with unevaluated properties that were transferred to the full cost pool.
DD&A expense was $150.6 million during 2021, compared to $234.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease during 2021 compared to the comparable 2020 period was primarily due to lower depletable costs due to the step down in book value resulting from fresh start accounting as of September 18, 2020 and an accelerated depreciation charge of $39.2 million during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. Our oil and natural gas properties depletion rate was $6.71 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Full Cost Pool Ceiling Test
Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter (as well as at the end of the Predecessor period) to perform a ceiling test calculation. Under these rules, the full cost ceiling value is calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period. The average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field, was $63.86 at December 31, 2021, $35.84 at December 31, 2020, $40.08 at September 18, 2020 and $55.55 at December 31, 2019. We recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write-down of $14.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, with first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices for the preceding 12 months averaging $36.40 per Bbl, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field. The write-down was primarily a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Wyoming property interests (see Note 3, Acquisition and Divestitures) which was recorded based on a valuation that utilized NYMEX strip oil prices at the acquisition date, which were significantly higher than the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices used to value the cost ceiling. Primarily as a result of commodity price declines during 2020, the Predecessor recognized full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of $996.7 million during the period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020, and an additional full cost pool ceiling test write-down of $1.0 million was recognized during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
Reorganization Items, Net
“Reorganization items, net” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations includes (i) expenses incurred during the Company’s “prepackaged” voluntary bankruptcy subsequent to the Petition Date as a direct result of the Plan, (ii) gains or
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
losses from liabilities settled and (iii) fresh start accounting adjustments. Professional service provider charges associated with our restructuring that were incurred outside of this period (before the Petition Date and after the Emergence Date) are recorded in “Other expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following table summarizes the losses (gains) on reorganization items, net:
Other Expenses
Other expenses totaled $10.8 million during 2021 and primarily includes plant operating expenses, litigation accruals and noncash fair value adjustments for contingent consideration payments related to our March 2021 Wind River Basin CO2 EOR field acquisition, slightly offset by insurance reimbursements for previously-incurred costs associated with the February 2020 Delta-Tinsley CO2 pipeline repair. Other expenses totaled $43.9 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the year ended December 31, 2020. Other expenses during 2020 primarily are comprised of $28.2 million of professional fees associated with restructuring activities, $5.1 million for the write-off of certain trade receivables, $4.3 million of costs associated with the Delta-Tinsley CO2 pipeline repair, and $0.9 million of costs associated with the APMTG Helium, LLC helium supply contract ruling.
Income Taxes
Our income tax provisions were based on an estimated combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 25% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than our estimated statutory rate, primarily due to our overall deferred tax asset position and the valuation allowance offsetting those assets. As we had pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2021, the income tax expense resulting from our income is substantially offset by a change in valuation allowance, resulting in essentially no tax provision.
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
As of December 31, 2021, we are in a net deferred tax asset position primarily due to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and differences in the tax basis of accrued liabilities, including derivative contract liabilities. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, we continue to record a valuation allowance on our underlying deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021, as we believe our deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. We intend to maintain the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. It is reasonably possible that sufficient evidence required to release our valuation allowance will exist in the future if the current strength being observed in commodity prices is sustained. Such positive evidence may allow us to reach a conclusion that all, or a portion of, the valuation allowance associated with our federal net deferred tax assets, totaling $51.4 million as of December 31, 2021, will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance are subject to the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.
The current income tax benefit for the Predecessor period ended September 18, 2020 represents amounts expected to be realized from refundable alternative minimum tax credits and certain state tax obligations that we expect to be realized.
As provided for under FASC 740-270-35-2, we determined the actual effective tax rate for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020 was the best estimate of our annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the 2020 Predecessor period was lower than our estimated statutory rate, primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets after the application of fresh start accounting. Our income tax provision for the Successor 2020 period was also based on the same estimated statutory rate of approximately 25% but was near zero, as any tax expense or benefit associated with pre-tax book income or loss was offset with a change in valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets. The Successor’s effective tax rate of 4.7% was primarily due to adjustments related to our Texas net deferred tax liabilities.
We have $0.6 million of alternative minimum tax credits, which under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will be refunded in 2022 and are recorded as a receivable on the balance sheet. Our state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years, starting in 2025. The statutes of limitation for our income tax returns for tax years ending prior to 2018 have lapsed and therefore are not subject to examination by respective taxing authorities.

Per-BOE Data
The following table summarizes our cash flow and results of operations on a per-BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the significant individual components is discussed above.
(1)General and administrative expenses include (a) $15.3 million of performance stock-based compensation related to the full vesting of outstanding performance awards during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a significant non-recurring expense, which if excluded, would have caused these expenses to average $3.60 per BOE and (b) an accrual for severance-related costs of $18.6 million associated with our voluntary separation program for the year ended December 31, 2019, which if excluded, would have averaged $3.03 per BOE.
(2)Represents an accelerated depreciation charge related to impaired unevaluated properties that were transferred to the full cost pool.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Debt and Interest Rate Sensitivity
At December 31, 2021, we had $35.0 million of outstanding borrowing under our Bank Credit Agreement. At this level of variable-rate debt, an increase or decrease of 10% in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our interest expense. Our Bank Credit Agreement does not have any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies. The following table presents the principal and fair values of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2021:
Commodity Derivative Contracts
We enter into oil derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Generally, these contracts have consisted of various combinations of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps, fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put, and basis swaps. The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt, financial strength, expectation of future commodity prices, and occasionally requirements under our bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the hedging requirements under our Bank Credit Agreement requiring certain non-recurring minimum commodity hedge levels covering anticipated crude oil production through July 31, 2022, and we have no further hedging requirements under our Bank Credit Agreement. In order to provide a level of price protection to our oil production, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2023 using NYMEX fixed-price swaps and costless collars. Depending on market conditions, we may continue to add to our existing 2022 and 2023 hedges. See also Note 12, Commodity Derivative Contracts, and Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts.
All of the mark-to-market valuations used for our commodity derivatives are provided by external sources. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. All of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our senior secured bank credit facility (or affiliates of such lenders). We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our commodity derivative contracts, which we have measured for nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads.
For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these commodity derivative contracts will be charged to earnings instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings.
At December 31, 2021, our commodity derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of $134.5 million, $75.7 million higher than the $58.8 million net liability recorded at December 31, 2020. This change is primarily related to the expiration of commodity derivative contracts during 2021, new commodity derivative contracts entered into during 2021 for future periods, and to the changes in oil futures prices between December 31, 2020 and 2021.

Commodity Derivative Sensitivity Analysis
Based on NYMEX oil futures prices and derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2021, and assuming both a 10% increase and decrease thereon, we would expect to make payments on our crude oil derivative contracts as shown in the following table:
Our commodity derivative contracts are used as an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future production. As a result, changes in receipts or payments of our commodity derivative contracts due to changes in commodity prices, as reflected in the above table, would be mostly offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the cash receipts on sales of our oil production to which those commodity derivative contracts relate.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make certain estimates and judgments. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements.
Fresh Start Accounting
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we met the criteria and were required to adopt fresh start accounting in accordance with FASC Topic 852, Reorganizations, which on the Emergence Date resulted in a new entity, the Successor, for financial reporting purposes, with no beginning retained earnings or deficit as of the fresh start reporting date. Fresh start accounting requires that new fair values be established for the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity as of the date of emergence from bankruptcy, September 18, 2020. The Emergence Date fair values of the Successor’s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values as reflected on the historical balance sheet of the Predecessor and required a number of estimates and judgments to be made. All estimates, assumptions, valuations and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments, financial projections, enterprise value and equity value, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, valuations or financial projections will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. Among the most material of these judgments and estimates that were made were the following:
•Reorganization Value - The reorganization value derived from the range of enterprise values associated with the Plan was allocated to the Company’s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The value of the reconstituted entity (i.e., Successor) was based on management projections and the valuation models as determined by the Company’s financial advisors in setting an estimated range of enterprise values. With the assistance of third-party valuation advisors, we determined the enterprise and corresponding equity value of the Successor using various valuation approaches and methods, including: (i) income approach using a calculation of the present value of future cash flows based on our financial projections, (ii) the market approach using selling prices of similar assets and (iii) the cost approach.
•Oil and Natural Gas Properties - The fair value of our oil and natural gas properties was determined based on the discounted cash flows expected to be generated from these assets. The computations were based on market conditions and reserves in place as of the Emergence Date.
The fair value analysis was based on the Company’s estimated future production rates of proved and probable reserves as prepared by the Company’s independent petroleum engineers. Discounted cash flow models were prepared using the
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
estimated future revenues and operating costs for all developed wells and undeveloped properties comprising the proved and probable reserves. Future revenue estimates were based upon estimated future production rates and forward strip oil and natural gas prices as of the Emergence Date through 2024 and escalated for inflation thereafter, adjusted for differentials. Operating costs were adjusted for estimated inflation beginning in year 2025. A risk adjustment factor was applied to each reserve category, consistent with the risk of the category. The discounted cash flow models also included adjustments for income tax expenses.
Discount factors utilized were derived using a weighted average cost of capital computation, which included an estimated cost of debt and equity for market participants with similar geographies and asset development type and varying corporate income tax rates based on the expected point of sale for each property’s produced assets. Reserve values were also adjusted for any asset retirement obligations as well as for CO2 indirect costs not directly allocable to oil fields.
•CO2 Properties - The fair value of CO2 properties includes the value of CO2 mineral rights and associated infrastructure and was determined using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach. After-tax cash flows were forecast based on expected costs to produce and transport CO2 as estimated by management, and income was imputed using a gross-up of costs based on a five-year average historical EBITDA margin for publicly traded companies that primarily develop or produce natural gas. Cash flows were also adjusted for a market participant profit on CO2 costs, since Denbury charges oil fields for CO2 use on a cost basis. Cash flows were then discounted using a rate considering reduced risk associated with CO2 industrial sales.
•Pipelines - The fair values of our pipelines were determined using a combination of the replacement cost method under the cost approach and the discounted cash flow method under the income approach. The replacement cost method considers historical acquisition costs for the assets adjusted for inflation, as well as factors in any potential obsolescence based on the current condition of the assets and the ability of those assets to generate cash flow. For assets valued using the discounted cash flow method, after-tax cash flows were forecast based on expected costs estimated by management, and profits were imputed using a gross-up of costs based on a five-year average historical EBITDA margin for publicly traded companies that primarily transport natural gas.
Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and natural gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and natural gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets topic of the FASC, under which the net book value of assets is measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and natural gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period through the end of each quarterly reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedging instruments for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC (see below), and as a result, these contracts are not considered in the full cost ceiling test.
We make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and natural gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as revisions in estimated oil and natural gas volumes, changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re-allocations by the purchasers or pipelines, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs.
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare reported estimates, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last three years, annual revisions to our reserve estimates, excluding any revisions related to changes in commodity prices, have averaged approximately 3.9% of the previous year’s estimates and have been both positive and negative.
Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. These changes in quantities affect our DD&A rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserve quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2021 oil and natural gas property DD&A rate from $6.71 per BOE to approximately $6.43 per BOE, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DD&A rate to approximately $7.01 per BOE. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values, determined solely by our lenders, are the primary factors in determining the maximum borrowing base under our senior secured bank credit facility, particularly quantities and values of our proved developed producing reserves.
Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter (as well as at the end of the Predecessor period) to perform a ceiling test calculation. The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10%), based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period; plus (2) the cost of properties not being amortized; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; less (4) related income tax effects. Our future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO2 reserves nor those related to the cost of constructing CO2 pipelines, as we do not have to incur additional CO2 capital costs to develop the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Therefore, we include in the ceiling test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of our capitalized CO2 costs related to CO2 reserves and CO2 pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves. The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly.
The average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field, was $63.86 at December 31, 2021, $35.84 at December 31, 2020, $40.08 at September 18, 2020, and $55.55 at December 31, 2019. We recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write-down of $14.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, with first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices for the preceding 12 months averaging $36.40 per Bbl, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field. The write-down was primarily a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Wyoming property interests (see Note 3, Acquisition and Divestitures) which was recorded based on a valuation that utilized NYMEX strip oil prices at the acquisition date, which were significantly higher than the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices used to value the cost ceiling. Primarily as a result of commodity price declines during 2020, the Predecessor recognized full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of $996.7 million during the period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020, and an additional full cost pool ceiling test write-down of $1.0 million was recognized during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
We exclude certain unevaluated costs from the amortization base and full cost ceiling test pending the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. The costs classified as unevaluated are transferred to the full cost amortization base as the properties are developed, tested and evaluated. At least annually, we test these assets for impairment based on an evaluation of management’s expectations of future pricing, evaluation of lease expiration terms, and planned project development activities. Given the significant declines in NYMEX oil prices in March and April 2020 due to the oil supply and demand imbalance precipitated by the dramatic fall in demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the concurrent OPEC+ decision to increase oil supply, we reassessed our development plans and transferred $244.9

million of our unevaluated costs to the full cost pool during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in our oil and natural gas properties, including unevaluated properties, being recorded at their fair values at the Emergence Date (see Note 2, Fresh Start Accounting, for additional information).
Tertiary Injection Costs
Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques, such as CO2 injection, until we can demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our cash out-of-pocket costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties.
We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e., a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs until we are able to recognize proved oil reserves associated with the development project. After we see a production response to the CO2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred, and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion. We capitalized $7.6 million of tertiary injection costs associated with our tertiary projects during 2021, $2.3 million during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $16.2 million during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020.
Income Taxes
We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had tax valuation allowances totaling $125.5 million and $129.4 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of our federal and state deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our underlying deferred tax assets were comprised of federal deferred tax assets of $51.4 million and $54.3 million and state deferred tax assets of $74.1 million and $75.1 million, respectively. The valuation allowances will remain until the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to become utilized. Management considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence includes our cumulative loss position, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. Significant judgment is involved in this determination as we are required to make assumptions about forecasted commodity prices and economics in the oil and gas industry that may impact our ability to generate future earnings. Such estimates are inherently subjective. Changes in judgment regarding future realization of deferred tax assets may result in a reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the period that determination is made, and our net income during that period would benefit from a lower effective tax rate. A 1% increase in our statutory tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense (benefit) by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, ($0.5 million) during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, although any change would be offset by a corresponding change in our valuation allowance, and ($18.5 million) during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. See Note 9, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements and Results of Operations - Income Taxes above for further information concerning our income taxes.
Fair Value Estimates
The FASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy
Denbury Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our recurring fair value measurements.
Significant uses of fair value measurements include:
•valuation of the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity upon application of fresh start accounting (see Fresh Start Accounting above);
•allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions;
•assessment of impairment of long-lived assets; and
•recorded value of commodity derivative instruments.
Impairment Assessment of Long-Lived Assets
We test long-lived assets that are not subject to our quarterly full cost pool ceiling test for impairment, including a portion of our capitalized CO2 properties and pipelines, and long-term contracts to sell CO2 to industrial customers, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The factors we assess to determine if a long-lived asset impairment test is necessary include, among other factors, a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant decrease in the market price of an asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group).
We perform our long-lived asset impairment test by comparing the net carrying costs of our long-lived asset groups to the respective expected future undiscounted net cash flows that are supported by these long-lived assets which include production of our probable and possible oil and natural gas reserves. If the undiscounted net cash flows are below the net carrying costs for an asset group, we must record an impairment loss by the amount, if any, that net carrying costs exceed the fair value of the long-lived asset group. Significant assumptions impacting expected future undiscounted net cash flows include projections of future oil and natural gas prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, projections of future rates of production, timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projected availability and cost of CO2, projected recovery factors of tertiary reserves and risk-adjustment factors applied to the cash flows. We performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2021 and determined there were no material changes to our key cash flow assumptions and no triggering events since September 18, 2020 when the Company’s assets were revalued in fresh start accounting; therefore, no impairment test was performed for the fourth quarter of 2021.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
Historically, we have entered into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Generally, these contracts have consisted of various combinations of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps, fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put, and basis swaps. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The valuation methods used to measure the fair values of these assets and liabilities require considerable management judgment and estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value estimates, such as forward prices for commodities, interest rates, volatility factors and credit worthiness, as well as other relevant economic measures. We do not apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts under the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic; accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income (loss) than if we were to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic, we believe that for us, the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. We estimate that a 10% increase in NYMEX oil futures prices as of December 31, 2021 would

increase our estimated payments on our crude oil derivative contracts by $60 million, and a 10% decrease in NYMEX oil futures prices would reduce our estimated payments by $54 million.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION
Reconciliation of Standardized Measure to PV-10 Value
PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932. We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company’s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis. Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties. PV-10 Value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold, to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and natural gas properties, and to perform our impairment testing of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See also Glossary and Selected Abbreviations for the definition of “PV-10 Value” and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Standardized Measure to PV-10 Value for the periods indicated:
