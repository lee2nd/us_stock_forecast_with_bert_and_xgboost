Overview
We are an international seafood company that imports, packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat, and other premium seafood products. Our current source of revenue is from importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia, the Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States and Canada under several brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika, Crab & Go, First Choice, Good Stuff and Coastal Pride Fresh, and steelhead salmon produced under the brand name Little Cedar Farms for distribution in Canada. The crab meat which we import is processed in 13 plants throughout Southeast Asia. Our suppliers are primarily via co-packing relationships, including two affiliated suppliers. We sell primarily to food service distributors. We also sell our products to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors.
COVID-19
The current COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business operations, including disruptions and restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our seafood products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities. Any such disruption or delay may impact our sales and operating results. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many other countries. As a result of COVID-19, the Company has experienced decreases in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
As a result of the business interruption experienced to date, management has taken steps to reduce expenses across all areas of its operations, including payroll, marketing, sales and warehousing expenses. The extent to which we are affected by COVID-19 will largely depend on future developments and restrictions which may disrupt interactions with customers, suppliers, staff and advisors which cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental and business responses to the pandemic and the impact on the global economy, our customers’ demand for our products, and our ability to provide our products. We continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on our business.

At December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital surplus of $2,831,718 including $960,000 in stockholder loans that were subordinated to its working capital line of credit as compared to a working capital deficit of $2,527,059 at December 31, 2020, including $1,299,712 in stockholder loans. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity consisted of inventory of $2,119,441 and accounts receivable of $1,231,181 at December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital was due primarily to an increase of inventory of $286,780, accounts receivable of $148,713 and other current assets of $3,525,736 and the decrease of related party notes payable of $1,534,612.
The Company has historically financed its operations through the cash flow generated from operations, loans from stockholders and other related parties as well as a working capital line of credit and the sale of equity in private offerings.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, is highly uncertain and subject to change.

Working Capital Line of Credit
Keeler & Co. entered into a $14,000,000 revolving line of credit with ACF on August 31, 2016, the proceeds of which were used to pay off the prior line of credit, pay new loan costs of approximately $309,000 and provide additional working capital to the Company. This facility was amended on November 18, 2016, June 19, 2017, October 16, 2017, September 19, 2018, November 8, 2018, July 29, 2019, November 26, 2019 and May 7, 2020 and was secured by all of the assets of Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride. The interest rate under the line of credit was equal to the greater of (i) the 3-month LIBOR rate plus 9.25%, (ii) the prime rate plus 6.0%, and (iii) a fixed rate of 6.5%. As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate was 0%.
On March 31, 2021, Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride entered into a loan and security agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with Lighthouse pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, Lighthouse made available to Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride (together, the “Borrowers”) a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit for a term of thirty-six months, renewable annually for one-year periods thereafter. Amounts due under the line of credit are represented by a revolving credit note issued to Lighthouse by the Borrowers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Loan Agreement, except for the requirement to maintain a greater than $50,000 cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2021 which was accepted by Lighthouse.
The advance rate of the revolving line of credit is 85% with respect to eligible accounts receivable and the lower of 60% of the Borrowers’ eligible inventory, or 80% of the net orderly liquidation value, subject to an inventory sublimit of $2,500,000. The inventory portion of the loan will never exceed 50% of the outstanding balance. Interest on the line of credit is the prime rate (with a floor of 3.25%), plus 3.75%. The Borrowers paid Lighthouse a facility fee of $50,000 in three instalments of $16,667 in March, April and May 2021 and will pay an additional facility fee of $25,000 on each anniversary of March 31, 2021. On January 14, 2022, the maximum inventory advance under the line of credit was adjusted from 50% to 70% until June 30, 2022, 65% to July 31, 2022, 60% to August 31, 2022 and 55% to September 30, 2022 at a monthly fee of 0.25% on the portion of the loan in excess of the 50% advance, in order to increase imports to meet customer demand. As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate was 7.0%.
The line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest on all the assets of each Borrower. Pursuant to the terms of a guaranty agreement, the Company guaranteed the obligations of the Borrowers under the note and John Keeler, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, provided a personal guaranty of up to $1,000,000 to Lighthouse.
The Borrowers utilized $784,450 of the Lighthouse revolving line of credit to repay the outstanding indebtedness owed to ACF as of March 31, 2021.

Lind Global Fund II LP investment
On January 24, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lind Global Fund II LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Lind”), pursuant to which the Company issued to Lind a secured, two-year, interest free convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $5,750,000 and a five-year warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments. The warrant provides for cashless exercise and for full ratchet anti-dilution if the Company issues securities at less than $4.50 per share. In connection with the issuance of the note and the warrant, the Company paid a $150,000 commitment fee to Lind.
The outstanding principal under the note is payable commencing July 24, 2022, in 18 consecutive monthly installments of $333,333, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of common stock at a price (the “Repayment Share Price”) based on 90% of the five lowest volume weighted average prices (“VWAP”) during the 20-days prior to the payment date with a floor price of $1.50 per share (the “Floor Price”), or a combination of cash and stock provided that if at any time the Repayment Share Price is deemed to be the Floor Price, then in addition to
shares, the Company will pay Lind an additional amount in cash as determined pursuant to a formula contained in the note.
In connection with the issuance of the note, the Company granted Lind a first priority security interest and lien on all of its assets, including a pledge on its shares in John Keeler & Co. Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a security agreement and a stock pledge agreement with Lind, dated January 24, 2022. Each subsidiary of the Company also granted a second priority security interest in all of its respective assets.
The note is mandatorily payable prior to maturity if the Company issues any preferred stock (with certain exceptions described in the note) or, if the Company or its subsidiaries issues any indebtedness other than certain amounts under the current line of credit facility with Lighthouse Financial Corp. The Company also agreed not to issue or sell any securities with a conversion, exercise or other price based on a discount to the trading prices of the Company’s stock or to grant an investor the right to receive additional securities based on future transactions of the Company on terms more favorable than those granted to Lind, with certain exceptions.
Commencing on the earlier of July 24, 2022 or the effectiveness of the registration statement covering Lind’s shares, if the Company fails to maintain the listing and trading of its common stock, the note will become due and payable and Lind may convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal at the lower of the then current conversion price and 80% of the average of the 3-day VWAP during the 20 days prior to delivery of the conversion notice.
If a resale registration statement is not effective covering the shares of common stock issuable to Lind in 180 days following January 24, 2022, the note will be in default. Lind was also granted piggyback registration rights.
If the Company engages in capital raising transactions, Lind has the right to purchase up to 10% of the new securities.
The note is convertible into common stock at $5.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments, at any time after the earlier of six months from issuance or the date the registration statement is effective; provided that no such conversion may be made that would result in beneficial ownership by Lind and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. If shares are issued by the Company at less than the conversion price, the conversion price will be reduced to such price.
Upon a change of control of the Company, as defined in the note, Lind has the right to require the Company to prepay 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the note.
The Company may prepay the outstanding principal amount of the note, provided Lind may convert up to 25% of the principal amount of the note at a price per share equal to the lesser of the Repayment Share Price or the conversion price.
The Note contains certain negative covenants, including restricting the Company from certain distributions, stock repurchases, borrowing, sale of assets, loans and exchange offers.
Upon an event of default as described in the note, the note will become immediately due and payable at a default interest rate of 125% of the then outstanding principal amount. Upon a default, all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount may be converted into shares of common stock by Lind at the lower of the conversion price and 80% of the average of the three lowest daily VWAPs.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of the acquired business in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with an acquisition. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and trademarks. For goodwill, our policy is to assess for impairment at year-end. For other intangible assets with definite lives, we assess for impairment only if events occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Annually, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets. Our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.
When using a quantitative test, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Our assessment for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets compared the fair value of the reporting unit to the corresponding carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Based on our year-end 2021 annual impairment analysis for goodwill, trademarks and non-compete agreements, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill, trademarks and non-compete agreements exceeded its carrying value. No impairment was recorded for goodwill, trademarks and non-compete agreements. For customer relationships, the analysis concluded an impairment of $374,300 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during year-end December 31, 2021.
The fair value conclusions as of December 31, 2021 are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the income approach, which include forecasted revenues, perpetual growth rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management.
Fair value of the reporting unit is therefore determined using significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company has used recent historical performance, current forecasted financial information, and broad-based industry and economic statistics as a basis to estimate the key assumptions utilized in the forecasted cash flow model. These key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change based on future changes, industry and global economic and geo-political conditions, and the timing and success of the implementation of current strategic initiatives. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on estimated future cash flows is uncertain and will largely depend on the outcome of future events, which could result in goodwill impairments going forward.
Inventories
Substantially all of the Company’s inventory consists of packaged crab meat located at a public cold storage facility and merchandise in transit from suppliers. The Company also has eggs and fish in process inventory from TOBC. The cost of inventory is primarily determined using the specific identification method for crab meat. Fish in process inventory is measured based on the estimated biomass of fish on hand. The Company has established a standard procedure to estimate the biomass of fish on hand using counting and sampling techniques. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method for crab meat and using various estimates and assumptions in regard to the calculation of the biomass, including expected yield, market value of the biomass, and estimated costs of completion.
Merchandise is purchased cost and freight shipping point and becomes the Company’s asset and liability upon leaving the suppliers’ warehouse. The Company had in-transit inventory of approximately $1,468,000 and $522,000 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market based on its assessment of market conditions, inventory turnover and current stock levels. Inventory write-downs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company recorded an inventory allowance of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to approximately $71,400 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as such, we record revenue when our customer obtains control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s source of revenue is from importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States and Canada under several brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika, Crab & Go, First Choice, Good Stuff and Coastal Pride Fresh and steelhead salmon produced by TOBC under the brand name Little Cedar Farms for distribution in Canada. We sell primarily to food service distributors. We also sell our products to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors.
To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer by receipt of purchase orders and confirmations sent by the Company which includes a required line of credit approval process, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract which includes shipment of goods to the customer FOB shipping point or destination, (3) determine the transaction price which initiates with the purchase order received from the customer and confirmation sent by the Company and will include discounts and allowances by customer if any, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract which is the shipment of the goods to the customer and transaction price determined in step 3 above and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation which is when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customers by shipment or delivery of the products.
The Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable to a customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement’s transaction price, thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized, unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.
