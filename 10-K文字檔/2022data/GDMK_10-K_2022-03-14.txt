Recent Developments
Equity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Williamsburg
On November 2, 2021, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Williamsburg Venture Holdings, LLC (“Williamsburg”), pursuant to which the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct Williamsburg, an unrelated third party, to purchase up to $5,000,000 of its Common Stock . The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company can sell the shares of Common Stock (the “Put Shares”) to Williamsburg from time-to-time over the 12-month period commencing on the date commencing on November 2, 2021, and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which Williamsburg shall have purchased up to $5,000,000 of shares, (ii) November 2, 2022, or (iii) written notice of termination by the Company to Williamsburg, which shall not occur at any time that Williamsburg holds any of the shares it purchased in connection with the applicable Put Notice. Each notice to Williamsburg shall state the number of shares of the Common Stock Williamsburg is required to purchase, not to exceed a value of the lower of 200% of the average daily trading volume and $500,000. The price per share of Common Stock shall be 90% of the average of the volume weighted average price of the Company’s Common Stock for five trading days following the date of the delivery of the shares.
As consideration for its commitment to purchase shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to Williamsburg 50,000 shares of Common Stock.
There is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the conditions under the Purchase Agreement or that we will be able to draw down any portion of the amounts available under the Purchase Agreement (the “Commitment Shares”).
We also entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with Williamsburg, pursuant to which, we have filed a registration statement with the SEC relating to Williamsburg’s resale of any shares of Common Stock it purchases, including the Commitment Shares. The effectiveness of this Registration Statement, which is currently being reviewed by the SEC, is a condition precedent to our ability to sell shares of our Common Stock to Williamsburg under the Purchase Agreement.
Discussion of the Years Ended 2021 and 2020
Revenues and Cost of Sales
Sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,665,017 compared to sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1,660,726, an increase of $1,004,291or approximately 60.5%. Our sales increases in the 2021 period are attributable to the addition of a new customer, new products as well as increased sales to existing customers; offset by the impact of Covid-19.
Historically, the Company has relied on a small number of customers to generate a large portion of its revenue. In 2021, five customers accounted for approximately 99% of the Company revenues. In 2020, four customers accounted for 91% of the Company’s revenues. Loss of any one of these five customers would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability and liquidity.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross profit was $1,035,901 or 38.9 % of revenue compared to gross profit of $660,815 or 39.1% of revenue. The slight decrease in gross profit in 2021 as a percentage of sales (“gross margin”) compared to 2020, is attributable to increased shipping and container costs during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, were $2,237,178 compared to $26,821,661 for the same period ended December 31, 2020. Operating expenses consisted of payroll and taxes, legal and professional fees, rent and selling, general and administrative expenses. The 2020 period includes a non-cash charge of $26,020,400 in stock-based compensation related to the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock with super-voting rights to the Company’s chief executive officer. Excluding the one -time charge of $26,020,400, operating expenses were $2,237,178 in 2021 compared to $801,261. The increase in operating expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 are attributable to the payroll associated with the hiring of an operations manager, an increase of $953,063 in stock based compensation for consultants and services providers, and an increase of advertising expense of approximately $80,000.
Other income and (expense)
Other income and expense is comprised of other income items and interest expense. Other expense was $12,601 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5,785 in other income during the same period ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in other income and expense is attributable to a reduction of $21,698 in interest expense in the 2021 period more than offset by income from the forgiveness of 40,084 in PPP loans in 2020 period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company had $312,574 and $62,555 in cash on hand, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $438,415 compared to $41,597 for the same period ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to an increase in net loss in the 2021 period (net of non-cash charges) and a significant increase in inventory levels necessitated by world-wide supply chain issues which has slowed down the timing of inventory imported by the Company from overseas.
Cash flows from financing activities increased to $696,432 for the period ended December 31, 2021, compared to $71,969 during the same period ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash provided from financing activities is attributable to the receipt of $379,165 in government PPP loans in 2021 compared to $149,900 in 2020, as well as $300,000 in proceeds for private placements of common stock in 2021 compared to zero in the 2020 period .
A large portion of the Company’s liquidity in both 2021 and 2020 was provided by the SBA COVID-19 loans and EIDL loans thus allowing the Company to reduce its reliance on factoring. There can be no assurances that other forms of financing on reasonable terms, or continued higher levels of factoring will be available to the Company in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will achieve positive cash flow from operations.
Seasonality
The Company’s business is not subject to seasonality.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Going Concern
There is substantial doubt about the Company continuing as a going concern based on the Company’s accumulated deficit and accrued liabilities. For the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a net loss of $1,213,879 and had a stockholder’s deficit of $27,543,659.
The consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is in fact unable to continue as a going concern, the shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company.
