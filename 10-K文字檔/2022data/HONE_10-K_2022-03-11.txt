HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. When necessary, certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the Consolidated Financial Statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction therewith.
Overview
The Company’s principal subsidiary is the Bank. The Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank whose primary subsidiary is a residential mortgage company, HarborOne Mortgage, acquired on July 1, 2015.
On August 14, 2019, the Company completed a second-step mutual-to-stock conversion offering (the “Offering”). Prior to the completion of the Offering approximately 53% of the shares of common stock of the Company were owned by the MHC. The Company raised gross proceeds of $310.4 million and incurred expenses of $6.3 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $304.1 million by selling 31,036,812 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in the Offering. In addition, each share of the Company common stock owned by shareholders, other than the MHC, prior to the Offering was exchanged for 1.795431 shares of Company common stock, a total of 12,162,763 shares of Company common stock were issued in the exchange. The Company utilized $24.8 million to fund an additional ESOP loan, invested $151.3 million into the Bank’s operations, and retained the remaining amount for general corporate purposes.
As a result of the Offering, all shares and per share information prior to August 14, 2019 has been revised to reflect the 1.795431 exchange ratio. Such revised financial information presented in this Form 10-K is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
As described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments: HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage. The Bank segment provides consumer and business banking products and services to individuals, businesses and municipalities. Consumer products include loan and deposit products, and business banking products include loans for working capital, inventory and general corporate use, commercial real estate construction loans, and deposit accounts. The HarborOne Mortgage segment consists of originating residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary market and the servicing of those loans.
The HarborOne Bank segment generates the significant majority of our consolidated net interest income and requires the provision for loan losses. The HarborOne Mortgage segment generates the majority of our noninterest income. We have provided below

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
a discussion of the material results of operations for each segment on a separate basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which focuses on noninterest income and noninterest expenses. We have also provided a discussion of the consolidated operations of the Company, which includes the operations of HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage, for the same periods.
For additional revenue, net income, assets, and other financial information for each of the Company’s reportable segments, see Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22: Segment Reporting.”
COVID-19 Pandemic Update
During 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to have an impact on our operations.
Our commercial and consumer banking products and services are offered primarily in Southeastern New England, where individual and governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a broad curtailment of economic activity beginning in March 2020. During 2021, although economic and pandemic trends generally improved, pandemic mitigation efforts continued to impact our customers and employees. The longer-term potential impact on our business depends on future developments and individual and governmental responses to those developments. The sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period, as the potential exists for additional variants of COVID-19 to impede the economic recovery and exacerbate geographic differences in the spread of, and response to, COVID-19. As of December 31, 2021, we do not anticipate significant challenges to our ability to maintain our systems and controls and do not currently face any material resource constraints. The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity. If an extended recession caused large numbers of the Company’s deposit customers to withdraw their funds, the Company may become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
We had previously provided access to the PPP to both our existing customers and new customers, to ensure that small businesses in the communities we serve had access to this important lifeline for their businesses. As of December 31, 2021, outstanding PPP loans amounted to $27.0 million, and there was $949,000 in deferred processing fee income. We expect to complete the forgiveness process on the remaining PPP loans by the end of the first quarter of 2022.
We also provided payment deferrals and other accommodations to certain of our commercial loan customers whose businesses were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related mitigation efforts. As of December 31, 2021, all payment deferrals have expired. There are three commercial loans with expired deferrals, amounting to $2.7 million, that are delinquent and on non-accrual status. There is one commercial credit in the amount of $8.8 million whose deferral has expired and is current, but is on non-accrual status. The residential loan and consumer loan portfolios have not experienced significant credit quality deterioration as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, all payment deferrals on residential mortgage loans had expired. As of December 31, 2021, seven residential real estate loans with expired deferrals and a total outstanding principal balance of $978,000 are delinquent, and four of those loans, amounting to $735,000, are in non-accrual status. We have no active payment deferrals on consumer loans, eight loans with expired deferrals, and a total outstanding principal balance of $163,000 that are delinquent. Requests for additional extensions on residential mortgage loans and consumer loans were not significant as of December 31, 2021. The continuing impact and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increases in delinquencies, charge-offs and loan modifications in our loan portfolios in 2022.
Management continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercial loan portfolio, in light of current economic conditions and the effects of government actions to diminish the spread of new variants of the virus. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified across many sectors and is largely secured by commercial real estate loans, which make up 75.3% of the total commercial loan portfolio. Management has identified and monitors commercial loan sectors that may be susceptible to increased credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic: retail, office space, hotels, restaurants, and recreation. The five commercial sectors identified as at- risk totaled $800.2 million at December 31, 2021, which represents 35.4% of the commercial loan portfolio. The at-risk sectors include $671.5 million in commercial real estate loans, $79.4 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $49.2 million in commercial construction loans. Non-performing loans included in the at-risk sectors amounted to $20.4 million at December 31, 2021, the majority of which was $10.9 million included in the hotels sector and $8.8 million included in the office space sector.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Although we have identified certain sectors that have the potential to be more susceptible to negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as trends largely continue to improve, we continue to make prudent lending decisions that include these sectors. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated $214.6 million loans in the at-risk sectors, including $101.9 million in the hotel sector. These hotel sector credits are generally secured by low to moderately leveraged real estate with solid operating metrics and strong sponsorship, and are typically to existing customers that have a track record of performance with the bank.
Nonperforming assets increased $1.5 million, or 4.3%, from $34.7 million at December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of a few large commercial real estate credits. Overall, the loan portfolio has not experienced significant credit quality deterioration as of December 31, 2021, however, the continuing impact and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased delinquencies, charge-offs and loan modifications in these portfolios through the remainder of the year. Continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic effects will continue to impact the magnitude of loan loss provisions and allowance for loan losses.
While interest and fees will continue to accrue on short term deferrals, the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods. Should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees in future periods could be negatively impacted.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and its customers has not been fully manifested. The fiscal stimulus and relief programs may have only delayed material adverse financial impact to the Company, and once the stimulus programs have been exhausted the Company may experience these impacts. The impacts will be contingent upon the possible resurgence of the virus, including new strains, offset by the success of the vaccine and its distribution and the ability of customers and businesses to return to their pre-pandemic routines. We anticipate continued economic uncertainty and volatility, which may have a future adverse financial impact on the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain of our accounting policies, which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, require Management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
As of December 31, 2021, we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. For as long as we were an emerging growth company, we were permitted to take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies.
Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by Management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policies, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, are as follows:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by Management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. The allowance consists of general, specific reserve and unallocated components. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: the likelihood of default; the loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; the value of collateral; and the determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Commissioner, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See Note 5, “Loans” within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in item 8 of this annual report.
Goodwill. The assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair values of the net assets acquired and is not subsequently amortized. Identifiable intangible assets include core deposit premium and non-compete contracts and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives. Management assesses the recoverability of goodwill at least on an annual basis and of all intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test uses a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after this assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test compares book value to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded through earnings. Management has identified two reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Company’s reporting units are the same as the segments used for segment reporting: the Bank, including the two security corporations and a Rhode Island passive investment corporation; and HarborOne Mortgage.
Deferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Management reviews deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to identify any uncertainties pertaining to the realization of such assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets, Management assesses historical and forecasted operating results, including a review of eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by Management, the actual realization of net deferred tax assets could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If we were not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the related valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made and could have a negative impact on earnings. In addition, if actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by Management, we could incur penalties and interest imposed by taxing authorities.
Please see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of accounting policies.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Total Assets. Total assets increased $69.8 million, or 1.6%, to $4.55 billion at December 31, 2021 from $4.48 billion at December 31, 2020.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. At December 31, 2021 cash and cash equivalents were $194.7 million, a decrease of 5.4% from $205.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale at December 31, 2021 were $45.6 million, a decrease of $163.0 million, or 78.1%, from $208.6 million at December 31, 2020, as residential mortgage loan demand decreased primarily due to a decrease in refinancing activity.
Loans, net. At December 31, 2021, net loans were $3.56 billion, an increase of $123.1 million, or 3.6%, from $3.44 billion at December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in commercial real estate loans of $148.6 million, commercial construction loans of $37.2 million and residential real estate loans of $112.2 million, partially offset by decreases in commercial and industrial loans of $42.8 million and consumer loans of $142.1 million. Excluding the change in PPP loans, commercial and industrial loans increased $55.1 million. The allowance for loan losses was $45.4 million at December 31, 2021 and $55.4 million December 31, 2020, the decrease primarily reflecting the $7.3 million reversal of loan loss provision for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2021 regarding scheduled contractual maturities during the period indicated. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments. Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The following table also sets forth the rate structure of loans scheduled to mature after one year.
Generally, the actual maturity of loans is shorter than their contractual maturity due to prepayments. The average life of residential real estate loans is impacted by the current interest rate environment. The average life tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than the rates of the loans in the portfolio and to decrease when current rates are lower than the rates of the loans in the portfolio. Also, commercial and commercial real estate loans may be renewed at or near maturity, resulting in significant differences in principal payments actually received as compared to amounts contractually due in a period.
Securities. Total investment securities at December 31, 2021 were $394.0 million, an increase of $117.5 million, or 42.5%, from December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, purchases amounted to $274.6 million in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and $42.2 million U.S. government obligations. The total security portfolio represented 8.7% of total assets as of December 31, 2021, compared to 6.2% as of December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, with the intention to reduce credit risk in the investment portfolio, held-to-maturity securities were sold and as a result the remaining held-to-maturity securities were transferred to the available for sale category.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2021. Weighted average yields in the table below have been calculated based on the amortized cost of the security:
Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”). MSRs are created as a result of our mortgage banking origination activities and accounted for at fair value. At December 31, 2021, we serviced mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3.65 billion. Total MSRs were $38.3 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $24.8 million at December 31, 2020.
The fair value of our MSRs is determined by a third-party provider that determines the appropriate prepayment speed, discount and default rate assumptions based on our portfolio. Management obtains and reviews the calculation. Any measurement of fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made at a particular point in time. Those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different point in time.
Prepayment speeds are significantly impacted by mortgage rates. Decreasing mortgage rates normally encourage increased mortgage refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the MSRs, thereby reducing the value of MSRs. The value of MSRs added during 2021 and 2020 may not be as significantly impacted by changes in residential mortgage rates in the future due to the historically low mortgage rates during the period.
Deposits. Deposits increased $176.4 million, or 5.0%, to $3.68 billion at December 31, 2021 from $3.51 billion at December 31, 2020. The following table sets forth information concerning the composition of deposits:
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The growth in deposits was driven by an increase of $199.2 million in consumer and business deposits. Consumer and business deposit growth was primarily a response to marketing and promotions of retail products and customers maintaining liquidity due to market uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wholesale deposits includes brokered deposits of $100.0 million. The Bank participates in a reciprocal deposit program that converts deposits at the Bank into multiple deposits at other financial institutions. The reciprocal deposit program provides access to FDIC-insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding the current limits for depositors. Total deposits at December 31, 2021 included $43.8 million in reciprocal deposits, including $4.9 million in municipal deposits. The wholesale deposits provide a channel for the Company to seek additional funding outside the Bank’s core market. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to focus on enhancing our deposit mix in order to better manage our cost of funds and to expand our customer relationships.
The following table sets forth the average balances and weighted average rates of our deposit products at the dates indicated:
The total of estimated deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limits amounted to $952.7 million and $924.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bank provides insurance for deposits in excess of FDIC limits through the DIF. The following table sets forth the maturity of certificates of deposit, excluding brokered deposits, of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2021:
Borrowings. Total borrowings from the FHLB were $55.7 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $93.4 million from $149.1 million at December 31, 2020. On September 30, 2021, $20.0 million in FHLB borrowings with an average cost of 3.5% were prepaid, with a penalty of $1.1 million included in noninterest expense.
In August 2018, the Company issued $35.0 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.625% until September 1, 2023 at which time the interest rate resets quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the three month LIBOR plus 278 basis points. An appropriate replacement rate index will be determined as part of our LIBOR reference rate transition. The notes are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of unamortized issuance costs of $841,000 at December 31, 2021, which are being amortized over the period to maturity date.
Stockholders’ equity. Total stockholders’ equity was $679.3 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $696.3 million at December 31, 2020. The Company adopted its third share repurchase program on September 17, 2021 to repurchase up to 2,668,159 shares of the Company’s common stock, or approximately 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares. The Company had repurchased 800,364 shares at an average price of $14.55 under this share repurchase program as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
December 31, 2021 the Company repurchased a total of 5,021,067 shares at an average price of $13.68 for a total of $68.6 million under its share repurchase programs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, an additional 42,925 shares were acquired in connection with the satisfaction of tax obligations on vested restricted shares at an average price of $14.27 for a total of $613,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company purchased a total of 1,533,500 shares at an average price of $10.29 for a total of $15.9 million.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. Consolidated
Overview. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $58.5 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $44.8 million or $0.82 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, return on average assets was 1.29% and return on average equity was 8.45%, as compared to 1.05% and 6.55%, respectively, for the prior year. The Bank contributed $40.1 million in net income and HarborOne Mortgage contributed $21.7 million in net income. The 2021 results include $7.3 million reversal in provision for loan losses.
Average Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. Interest income on tax-exempt securities has been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent, or FTE, basis using a federal tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents, on a tax equivalent basis, the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income on a tax equivalent basis decreased $4.7 million, or 3.15%, in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily reflecting the repricing of adjustable rate loans and new loan originations at lower rates. Loan interest income decreased $1.9 million to $135.8 million, average loans increased $70.4 million and the yield decreased 14 basis points from a year ago. Commercial loan income includes the recognition of deferred fees on PPP loans in the amount of $5.9 million, as compared to $2.5 million in 2020. Loan interest income includes $3.6 million, as compared to $4.9 million in 2020, in accretion income from the fair value discount on loans acquired from Coastway.
Interest Expense. Compared to 2020, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $16.0 million, or 56.0% to $12.5 million from $28.5 million. The decrease primarily reflects a 55-basis-point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $211.0 million in average interest-bearing deposits, resulting in a $14.1 million decrease in interest expense on deposits. The cost of deposit funds was significantly impacted by falling rates and the deposit mix, as customers moved to more liquid options. The decreasing cost of certificates of deposits was the primary driver of the rate decrease, decreasing 101 basis points. The cost of FHLB borrowings decreased 14 basis points and the average balance decreased $107.3 million, resulting in a $1.9 million decrease in interest expense on FHLB borrowings.
Net Interest and Dividend Income. Compared to 2020, tax equivalent net interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $11.3 million, or 9.4%, to $131.4 million from $120.1 million. The tax equivalent net interest spread increased 19 basis points to 2.99% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.80% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis also increased 6 basis points to 3.12% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.06% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income Tax Provision. The provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $21.9 million and 27.3%, respectively, compared to $13.2 million and 22.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the recognition of a net tax benefit in the amount of $754,000

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
for a reserve release upon the expiration of the statute of limitations. The 2020 tax provision was impacted by a 2016 federal tax refund of $1.9 million recognized on the expiration of the statute of limitations.
Segments. The Company has two reportable segments: HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage. Revenue from HarborOne Bank consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Revenue from HarborOne Mortgage is comprised of interest earned on loans and fees received as a result of the residential mortgage origination, sale and servicing process. The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the increase or decrease in those results.
HarborOne Bank Segment
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Net Income. Bank net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $34.9 million, or 662.4%, to $40.1 million from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Pre-tax income increased $49.3 million, or 850.8%, primarily reflecting the $7.3 million reversal of provision for loan losses in 2021, as compared to provision for loan losses of $34.8 million in 2020.
Provision for Loan Losses. The Bank recorded a reversal of provision for loan losses of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to provision for loan loss of $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Management established a COVID-19 pandemic qualitative factor. In estimating the provision for the COVID-19 pandemic, Management considered economic factors, including unemployment rates and the interest rate environment, and trends in the pandemic, such as vaccination and case rates. Positive trends in these factors during 2021, resulted in Management decreasing the provision related to COVID-19 and the provision reversal during 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Bank recorded net charge-offs of $2.8 million compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans increased to $36.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $34.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily due commercial real estate loans.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Noninterest Income. Compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, total noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $149,000, or 0.7%, to $20.6 million from $20.7 million. The following table sets forth the components on non-interest income:
The primary reasons for the changes within the noninterest income categories shown in the preceding tables are noted below:
● The Bank records an intersegment loss on loans purchased from HarborOne Mortgage that is offset in consolidation. The Bank purchased $472.5 million residential mortgage loans from HarborOne Mortgage during 2021.
● The change in the MSR fair value was impacted by the 59-basis-point increase in the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity rate from year end 2020 offset by accelerated payoffs. Accelerated payoffs resulted in amortization of $1.1 million for 2021 and the rate increase resulted in a $1.0 million increase in fair value. Mortgage payoffs are expected to decrease as rates rise in 2022.
● The increase in interchange and other deposit fees reflects the reinstatement of fees and increased deposits.
● Other noninterest income in 2020 includes $1.6 million in income from the sale of VISA B shares held in the investment portfolio whereas 2021 had no such income.
● The gain on sale and call of securities primarily reflects gain recognized on the sale of $39.2 million of securities.
● Swap fee income is collected and recorded at the time the swap contract is entered into, and therefore income fluctuates as a function of the swap agreements entered into in a period.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $4.2 million, or 4.3% to $102.6 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table sets forth the components on noninterest expense:
The primary reasons for the significant changes within the noninterest expense categories shown in the preceding table are noted below:
● The compensation and benefits increase reflects an increase in salary cost as a result annual salary increases, increased ESOP expense consistent with the increase in the Company’s stock price and an increase in stock compensation expense.
● The increases in occupancy and equipment expenses is due an increase in building maintenance expense, new software licenses and the increase in branch locations.
● The Bank paid $1.1 million prepayment penalty on FHLB borrowings of $20.0 million in 2021 and no such penalty in 2020.
● The decrease in other expenses is due to a $1.5 million decrease in COVID-19 pandemic expenses.

HarborOne Mortgage Segment
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Net Income. HarborOne Mortgage recorded a net income of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net income of $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The HarborOne Mortgage segment’s results are heavily impacted by prevailing mortgage rates, refinancing activity and home sales.
Noninterest Income. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, noninterest income totaled $80.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively. Noninterest income is primarily from mortgage banking income for which the following table provides further detail:
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, HarborOne Mortgage closed $2.46 billion and $2.81 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans. The following tables provide additional loan production detail:
The primary reason for the changes within the noninterest income categories shown in the preceding tables are noted below:
● Gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased $43.6 million, or 41.3%, due to tighter margins and decreased residential mortgage demand as a result of decreased refinance activity in 2021 as mortgage interest rates trended up. Margins on mortgage loan sales decreased approximately 120 basis points as compared to 2020 and may continue to decline in 2022.
● Processing, underwriting and closing fees decreased, due to volume decreases.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in the December 31, 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2021.
Asset Quality
The following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated. We did not have any accruing loans past due 90 days or more at the dates presented.
Credit quality performance has remained strong, with total nonperforming assets of $36.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $34.7 million at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.79% and 0.77%, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commercial loans represent 66.9% of nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual commercial loans primarily consists of two commercial real estate credits totaling $17.8 million with specific reserves of $7.3 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
At December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses was $45.4 million, or 1.26% of total loans and 125.58% of nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was $55.4 million, or 1.59% of total loans and 162.44% of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021 were $36.1 million, or 1.00% of total loans, compared to $34.1 million, or 0.98% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents Management’s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date; however, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover losses which may be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated:

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The following table sets forth net charge-offs (recoveries) and the ratio of annualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans for the periods indicated:
For the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded a reversal of provision for loan losses of $7.3 million and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $34.8 million. The provision for loan losses is impacted by specific reserves, charge-offs, changes in historical charge-off trends, and adjusted for Management’s assessment of certain qualitative factors including, loan portfolio growth and composition changes, ongoing evaluations of credit quality trends and current economic conditions.
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Management established a COVID-19 pandemic qualitative factor. In estimating the provision for the COVID-19 pandemic, Management considers economic factors, including unemployment rates and the interest rate environment, and trends in the pandemic, such as vaccination and case rates. Positive economic and pandemic trends in 2021 resulted in Management decreasing the provision related to COVID-19 in the amount of $8.8 million. The provision for loan losses also included adjustments for our historical and peer loss experience rates, commercial real estate loan growth and charge-off activity. Net charge-offs totaled $2.8 million, or 0.08% of average loans outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $3.5 million, or 0.10%, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included adjustments for our analysis of our historical and peer loss experience rates, commercial real estate loan growth, and a $19.6 million provision directly related to the estimate of incurred losses and uncertainty resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowance for loan losses also reflects an additional provision expense and charge-off in the amount of $937,000 related to two non-performing commercial loans that were transferred out of portfolio and subsequently sold during the year.
Management of Market Risk
Net Interest Income Analysis. The Bank uses income simulation as the primary tool for measuring interest-rate risk inherent in our balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income, over specified time frames and using different interest rate shocks and ramps. The assumptions include, but are not limited to, Management’s best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and

frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the balance sheet composition and market conditions. Assumptions are supported with quarterly back-testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.
The table below set forth, as of December 31, 2021, the net interest income simulation results that estimate the impact of interest rate changes on the Company’s estimated net interest income over one year:
Economic Value of Equity Analysis. The Bank also uses the net present value of equity at risk, or “EVE,” methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve up to 300 basis points and down 100 basis points.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021, the estimated changes in the EVE that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for the Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.
The Board of Directors and Management review the methodology’s measurements for both net interest income and EVE on a quarterly basis to determine whether the exposure resulting from the changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure.
Liquidity Management and Capital Resources
Liquidity measures the Company’s ability to meet both current and future financial obligations of a short and long term nature. Liquidity planning is necessary for the Company to ensure it has the ability to respond to the needs of its customers as well as opportunities for earnings enhancements. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments and sales on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
The objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
positions. Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (iv) the objectives of our interest rate risk and investment policies.
We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which is primarily on deposit with FRBB. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio and our ability to sell loans in the secondary market. Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding. Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity.
Maturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRBB. As of December 31, 2021, we had additional borrowing capacity of $865.2 million from the FHLB and $57.8 million from the FRBB based on the amount of collateral pledged. We also have additional borrowing capacity under a $25.0 million unsecured federal funds line with a correspondent bank.
We continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout 2021. As of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $194.7 million, the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities was $394.0 million, and total deposits were $3.68 billion as of December 31, 2021.
HarborOne Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, HarborOne Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Supervision and Regulation-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness-Regulatory Capital Requirements” and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commitments. We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract amount of these instruments reflects the extent of involvement we have in these particular classes of financial instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments and unadvanced funds on lines-of-credit generally have fixed expiration dates and may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. In addition, from time to time we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans that we originate. For additional information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $169.8 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $628.3 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 totaled $553.2 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may use FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
