CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains certain estimates and forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “outlook,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about Corteva’s financial results or outlook; strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position; capital allocation strategy; liquidity; environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) targets; the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, restructuring actions, or cost savings initiatives; and the outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements and other estimates are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements and other estimates also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Corteva’s control. While the list of factors presented below is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Corteva’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of the important factors that could cause Corteva’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements include: (i) failure to successfully develop and commercialize Corteva’s pipeline; (ii) failure to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of Corteva’s products; (iii) effect of the degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of Corteva’s biotechnology and other agricultural products; (iv) effect of changes in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations; (v) effect of competition and consolidation in Corteva’s industry; (vi) effect of competition from manufacturers of generic products; (vii) costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements and the effect of actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements; (viii) effect of climate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors; (ix) failure to comply with competition and antitrust laws; (x) competitor’s establishment of an intermediary platform for distribution of Corteva's products; (xi) impact of Corteva's dependence on third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization; (xii) effect of industrial espionage and other disruptions to Corteva’s supply chain, information technology or network systems; (xiii) effect of volatility in Corteva’s input costs; (xiv) failure to raise capital through the capital markets or short-term borrowings on terms acceptable to Corteva; (xv) failure of Corteva’s customers to pay their debts to Corteva, including customer financing programs; (xvi) increases in pension and other post-employment benefit plan funding obligations; (xvii) risks related to environmental litigation and the indemnification obligations of legacy EID liabilities in connection with the separation of Corteva; (xviii) risks related to Corteva’s global operations; (xix) failure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, restructurings, cost savings initiatives, and other portfolio actions; (xx) capital markets sentiment towards ESG matters; (xxi) risks related to COVID-19; (xxii) Corteva’s ability to recruit and retain key personnel; (xxiii) Corteva’s intellectual property rights or defend against intellectual property claims asserted by others; (xxiv) effect of counterfeit products; (xxv) Corteva’s dependence on intellectual property cross-license agreements; and (xxvi) other risks related to the Separation from DowDuPont.
Additionally, there may be other risks and uncertainties that Corteva is unable to currently identify or that Corteva does not currently expect to have a material impact on its business. Where, in any forward-looking statement or other estimate, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of Corteva’s management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Corteva disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law. A detailed discussion of some of the significant risks and uncertainties which may cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

Overview
Refer to pages 3 - 5 for a discussion of the DowDuPont Merger, the Internal Reorganizations, and the Business Separations.
Basis of Presentation
Dow AgroSciences ("DAS") Common Control Combination
The transfer or conveyance of DAS to Corteva was treated as a transfer of entities under common control. As such, the company recorded the assets, liabilities, and equity of DAS on its balance sheet at their historical basis. Transfers of businesses between entities under common control requires the financial statements to be presented as if the transaction had occurred at the point at which common control first existed (the "Merger Effectiveness Time," or August 31, 2017 at 11:59 pm ET). As a result, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto include the results of DAS as of the Merger Effectiveness Time. See Note 1 - Background and Basis of Presentation and Note 4 - Common Control Business Combination, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Divestiture of EID ECP and EID Specialty Products Entities
The transfer of EID ECP and EID Specialty Products Entities meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. The comprehensive income (loss), stockholder's equity and cash flows related to EID ECP and EID Specialty Products Entities, respectively, have not been segregated and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, for 2019. Amounts related to EID ECP and EID Specialty Products Entities are consistently included or excluded from the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements based on the respective financial statement line item. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Overview
The following is a summary of results from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021:
•The company reported net sales of $15,655 million, an increase of 10 percent versus the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting a 5 percent increase in volume, a 4 percent increase in price, and a 1 percent favorable impact from currency. Volume and price gains were driven by continued penetration of new products, continued focus on the company's price for value strategy and pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs.
•Cost of goods sold ("COGS") totaled $9,220 million, up from $8,507 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increased volumes, higher input costs, freight and logistics, which are primarily market-driven, and unfavorable currency, partially offset by ongoing cost and productivity actions.
•Restructuring and asset related charges - net were $289 million, a decrease from $335 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The year ended December 31, 2021 primarily included $167 million related to severance and related benefit costs, asset related charges, and contract termination charges associated with 2021 Restructuring Activities and $125 million of non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits.
•Income from continuing operations after income taxes was $1,822 million, as compared to $756 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Operating EBITDA was $2,576 million, up from $2,087 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by strong price execution and volume gains in all regions and both segments.
In addition to the financial highlights above, the following events occurred during or subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2021:
•The company returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2021 under its previously announced share repurchase programs and through common stock dividends.
•On July 21, 2021, the company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the common stock dividend of $0.13 per share to $0.14 per share.
Priorities

•Deliver sales and earnings growth by continuing to leverage an industry-leading innovation pipeline to introduce new proprietary seed traits and crop protection formulations that anticipate and meet evolving customer needs and utilizing a comprehensive multi-channel, multi-brand strategy to align brands and capabilities across different sales channels.
•Drive actions to expand margins through pricing for high value technology and new products and operational excellence, which includes integrating its operations and continuing to drive operating efficiencies and creating a strong culture based on accountability.
•Generate cash flow growth reflecting operating discipline of working capital, including net working capital turns appropriate across the cycle.
•Deploy capital in a balanced and disciplined way investing in high return organic and inorganic growth opportunities as well as providing attractive returns to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.

Analysis of Operations
Global Economic Conditions
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The global health crisis caused by COVID-19 and the related government actions and stay at home orders have negatively impacted economic activity and increased political instability across the globe. Since the crisis began, Corteva has engaged its global Integrated Health Services Pandemic & Infectious Disease Team to take actions and implement guidelines and protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As COVID-19 becomes more contained, a rebound in economic activity has occurred, although varying regionally depending on government policies and regulations and the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments, vaccination rates, and the ability of COVD-19 variants to overcome containment efforts, available vaccines, and medical treatments. These varying levels of recovery have created a misalignment of supply and demand for labor, transportation and logistic services, energy, raw materials and other inputs, which have been exasperated in certain regions by one-time events, including extreme weather events. Corteva will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering its business operations that it determines are in the best interests of its stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. These alterations or modifications may impact the company's business, including the effects on its customers, employees, and prospects, or on its financial results through at least 2022. With the ongoing volatility in global markets, the company will continue to monitor various factors that could impact earnings and cash flows of the business, including, but not limited to the inflation of, or unavailability of raw material inputs and transportation and logistics services, currency fluctuations, expectations of future planted area (as influenced by consumer demand, ethanol markets and government policies and regulations), trade and purchasing of commodities globally and relative commodity prices.
2021 Restructuring Actions
During the first quarter of 2021, Corteva approved restructuring actions designed to right-size and optimize footprint and organizational structure according to the business needs in each region with the focus on driving continued cost improvement and productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the company recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $167 million, comprised of $74 million of severance and related benefit costs, $45 million of asset related charges, $6 million of asset retirement obligations and $42 million of costs related to contract terminations (contract terminations includes early lease terminations). The company does not anticipate any additional material charges from the 2021 Restructuring Activities as actions associated with this charge are substantially complete.
Future cash payments related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $70 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits, asset retirement obligations, and costs related to contract terminations.
The 2021 Restructuring Actions are expected to contribute to the company’s ongoing cost and productivity improvement efforts
through achieving an estimated $70 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2023. See Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
Share Buyback Plan
On August 5, 2021, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date ("2021 Share Buyback Plan"). The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. In connection with the 2021 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 5,572,000 shares during the year ended December 31, 2021 in the open market for a total cost of $250 million.
On June 26, 2019, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date ("2019 Share Buyback Plan"). The company completed the 2019 Share Buyback Plan during the third quarter of 2021. In connection with the 2019 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 15,378,000 shares, 8,503,000 shares, and 824,000 shares during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, in the open market for a total cost of $700 million, $275 million, and $25 million, respectively.

Execute to Win Productivity Program
During the first quarter of 2020, Corteva approved restructuring actions designed to improve productivity through optimizing certain operational and organizational structures primarily related to the Execute to Win Productivity Program. The company recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $185 million from inception-to-date under the Execute to Win Productivity Program, consisting of $124 million of asset related charges and $61 million of severance and related benefit costs. Actions associated with the Execute to Win Productivity Program were substantially complete by the end of 2020.
DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program
In September and November 2017, DowDuPont and EID approved post-merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted at the time by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The Synergy Program was designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Business Separations. The company recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $833 million from inception-to-date under the Synergy Program, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $316 million, contract termination costs of $190 million, and asset-related charges of $327 million. Actions associated with the Synergy Program, including employee separations, were substantially complete in 2019.
The company included cumulative savings associated with these actions within its cost synergy commitment of approximately $1.2 billion through 2021. See Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Net Sales
2021 versus 2020
Net sales were $15,655 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $14,217 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Volume increased 5 percent versus the year-ago period with increases in all regions, led by Latin America. The volume increases were primarily driven by strong demand, the continued penetration of new and differentiated products and increased planted area. Price increased 4 percent versus prior year, driven by a continued focus on the company's price for value strategy and pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs.
2020 versus 2019
Net sales were $14,217 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13,846 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Volume increased 5 percent versus the year-ago period, primarily driven by sales of new and differentiated products globally and across both segments. Price grew 3 percent on a full-year basis, with higher prices in all regions, led by Latin America partly to offset currency. Currency represented a headwind of 5 percent, led by the impact of the Brazilian Real.

COGS
2021 versus 2020
COGS was $9,220 million (59 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased volumes in both seed and crop protection, higher input costs, freight and logistics, which are primarily market-driven, and unfavorable currency, partially offset by ongoing cost and productivity actions. The market driven trends are expected to continue as global supply chains and logistics remain constrained across industries.
2020 versus 2019
COGS was $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,575 million (62 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by currency benefits, lack of inventory step-up in 2020 as compared to $272 million recognized in 2019, and ongoing cost and productivity actions. The decrease was partially offset by increased volumes, higher input costs in both seed and crop protection and higher royalties in seed. Amortization of inventory step-up was 2 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.
COGS was $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) on an as reported basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,386 million (61 percent of net sales) on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased volumes, higher input costs in both seed and crop protection and higher royalties in seed, partially offset by the above noted currency benefits and ongoing cost and productivity actions.
Research and Development Expense ("R&D")
2021 versus 2020
R&D expense was $1,187 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $1,142 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increases in contract labor, variable
compensation and unfavorable currency, partially offset by ongoing cost and productivity actions.
2020 versus 2019
R&D expense was $1,142 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1,147 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by currency benefits and ongoing cost and productivity actions, partially offset by increased investments to support new products in crop protection.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A")
2021 versus 2020
SG&A was $3,209 million (20 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3,043 million (21 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven primarily by increases in commission expense, employee related benefit costs, salaries and wages, variable compensation, enterprise resource planning ("ERP") costs and unfavorable currency, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and ongoing cost and productivity actions.
2020 versus 2019
SG&A was $3,043 million (21 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $3,065 million (22 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by currency benefits and ongoing cost and productivity actions taken to curtail spending, partially offset by higher commissions and selling expenses due to higher volumes, higher ERP costs and higher product launch costs.
Amortization of Intangibles
2021 versus 2020
Intangible asset amortization was $722 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $682 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the full year impact of the trade name asset, which changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to definite lived with a useful life of 25 years in the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information for the above items.
2020 versus 2019
Intangible asset amortization was $682 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $475 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the full year impact of germplasm assets, which changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to a definite lived with a useful life of 25 years in the fourth quarter of 2019. The remaining increase in amortization expense is primarily due to amortization of the trade name asset that was changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to definite lived in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The $92 million net charge associated with the Synergy Program was comprised of $69 million of contract termination charges and $30 million of asset related charges, partially offset by a $7 million benefit on the reduction of severance and related benefit costs. The $14 million net benefit associated with the DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring Program included a $17 million benefit on the reduction of severance and related benefit costs, partially offset by $3 million of asset related charges.
Asset Impairment
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company recognized a $144 million pre-tax ($110 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charge in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations related to certain IPR&D assets within the seed segment.

Integration and Separation Costs
Integration and separation costs were $744 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These costs consisted primarily of financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting, and other professional advisory fees associated with the preparation and execution of activities related to the Business Separations and the integration of EID’s Pioneer and Crop Protection businesses with DAS. Pro forma integration and separation costs were $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These costs were primarily driven by financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting, and other professional advisory fees associated with the preparation and execution of activities related to the Business Separations and the integration of EID’s Pioneer and Crop Protection businesses with DAS.
Other Income - Net
2021 versus 2020
Other income - net was income of $1,348 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and income of $212 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit credits, driven by the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments, a decrease in net exchange losses, and the Employee Retention Credit pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act as enhanced by the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) and American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”). The increases are partially offset by the 2021 officer indemnification payment and a charge related to a contract termination with a third-party service provider. See Note 9 - Supplementary Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
2020 versus 2019
Other income - net was income of $212 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and income of $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit credits was offset by higher net exchange losses as well as net losses on sales of businesses and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net gains in 2019 and a change in miscellaneous income. Other income - net for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $(53) million loss on the expected sale of the La Porte site. See Note 9 - Supplementary Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The objective of this program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies in order to minimize, on an after-tax basis, the effects of exchange rate changes. The net pre-tax exchange gains and losses are recorded in other income - net and the related tax impact is recorded in provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 9 - Supplementary Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Interest Expense
2021 versus 2020
Interest expense was $30 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change was primarily driven by lower average short-term borrowings and lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average long-term borrowings.
2020 versus 2019
Interest expense was $45 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change was primarily driven by lower average debt balances as a result of the redemption/repayment transactions in the second quarter of 2019 related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (refer to Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower average interest rates.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes on Continuing Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the company’s effective tax rate of 22.3 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of 2,346 million was unfavorably impacted by the tax impact of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not deductible in their local jurisdictions, the tax impact of income from pension and other post employment benefits, and a $23 million charge associated with repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. These items were partially offset by the impacts of favorable geographic mix of earnings and a $(57) million benefit related to U.S. tax credits for increasing research activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company’s effective tax rate of (12.0) percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $675 million was favorably impacted by a $(182) million tax benefit associated with the recognition of an elective cantonal component of the recent enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Reform”), a $(51) million tax benefit related to a return to accrual adjustment associated with an elective change in accounting method for the 2019 tax year impact of The Act's foreign tax provisions, a $(14) million tax benefit related to a return to accrual adjustment to reflect a change in estimate on the impact of a tax law enactment in a foreign jurisdiction, as well as an additional $(14) million of net tax benefits associated with changes in accruals for certain prior year tax positions in various other jurisdictions. These benefits were partially offset by the impacts of unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, the tax impact of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not deductible in their local jurisdictions, and a $19 million tax charge associated with a state tax valuation allowance in the U.S. based on a change in judgment about the realizability of a deferred tax asset.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company’s effective tax rate of 14.6 percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $(316) million was unfavorably impacted by a tax charge of $146 million related to the U.S. state blended tax rate changes associated with the Business Separations and a tax charge of $35 million related to application of foreign tax provisions. Other net unfavorable effective tax rate impacts included those related to the Argentine peso devaluation, integration and separation costs, non-tax-deductible amortization of the fair value step-up in inventories as a result of the Merger, the tax impact of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not deductible in their local jurisdictions, as well as geographic mix of earnings. Those unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a tax benefit of $(102) million related to an internal legal entity restructuring associated with the Business Separations, tax benefits of $(38) million associated with the enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Reform”), a $(34) million tax benefit associated with the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a legal entity in Switzerland, as well as $(19) million of tax benefits associated with changes in accruals for certain prior year tax positions and reductions in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits due to the closure of various tax statutes of limitations.

Interest Expense
2021 versus 2020
EID’s interest expense was $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header “Interest Expense - 2021 versus 2020,” and by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

EID’s interest expense was $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header "Interest Expense - 2020 versus 2019," and by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2021, EID had an effective tax rate of 22.2 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2,296 million, driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2021” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, EID had an effective tax rate of (18.3) percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $575 million, driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2020” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, EID had an effective tax rate of 16.8 percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $(422) million, driven by the items noted on page 43, under the header "Provision for Income Taxes - 2019" and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on a related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Corporate Outlook - 2022
Global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong with an expected record demand for grain and oilseeds. The company anticipates total U.S. corn and soybean planted area to be flat, with a modest shift towards soybeans.
The company expects net sales to be in the range of $16.7 billion and $17.0 billion, driven by new product sales and continued focus on the company’s price for value strategy, partially offset by currency headwinds.
The company expects Operating EBITDA to be in the range of $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion with new product sales, pricing and ongoing cost savings actions offsetting the expected increased input costs. Operating Earnings Per Share is expected to be in the range of $2.30 and $2.50 per share. Refer to further discussion of Non-GAAP metrics on pages 52 - 54.
The above outlook does not contemplate any extreme weather events, operational disruptions, significant changes in customers' demand or ability to pay, or further acceleration of currency and inflation impacts resulting from global economic conditions. Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the company’s control, such as Significant Items, without unreasonable effort (refer to page 53 for Significant Items recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019). However, the company expects non-operating benefits to be approximately $1 billion lower, as a result of the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments, an increase in the discount rates, and a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Refer to the company's discussion on Long-term Employee Benefits on page 65. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, the company recognizes non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a restructuring and asset related charge. For further discussion of accelerated prepaid royalty amortization refer to the Company's Critical Accounting Estimates for Prepaid Royalties on page 63.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The supplemental unaudited pro forma statements of operations (the "unaudited pro forma statements of operations") for Corteva for the year ended December 31, 2019 gives effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016.
For the periods presented below, Corteva’s results for all periods prior to the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization consist of the combined results of operations for Historical EID and DAS, and Corteva’s results for all periods after the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization represent the consolidated balances of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations below were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments, and events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., amortization of inventory step-up costs) are excluded. One-time transaction-related costs incurred prior to, or concurrent with, the closing of the Merger, the debt redemptions/repayments, and the Corteva Distribution are not included in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations through March 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations do not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs, that were not already reflected in GAAP results, following the separation and distribution transactions that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of Corteva. As no assurance can be made that these costs will be incurred or the growth synergies will be achieved, no adjustment has been made.
The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Corteva’s results of operations actually would have been had the above transactions been completed on January 1, 2016. In addition, the unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not purport to project the future operating results of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations were based on and should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.
Segment Reviews
The company operates in two reportable segments: seed and crop protection. The company’s seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The segment offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects and herbicides used to control weeds, and trait technologies that enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and also provides digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize product selection and, ultimately, help maximize yield and profitability. The segment competes in a wide variety of agricultural markets. The crop protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers and pasture and range management herbicides.
Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and segment operating EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, segment operating EBITDA is calculated on a pro forma basis, as this is the manner in which the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") assesses performance and allocates resources. Pro forma adjustments used in the calculation of pro forma segment operating EBITDA were determined in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments. For the year ended December 31, 2019, these adjustments give effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016 (refer to supplemental unaudited pro forma financial statements on page 45). The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB benefit (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EID businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (costs) excluded from segment operating EBITDA. All references to prices are based on local price unless otherwise specified.
A reconciliation of segment operating EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations after income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is included in Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Seed
Seed net sales were $8,402 million in 2021, up 8 percent from $7,756 million in 2020. The increase was driven by a 4 percent increase in price and a 4 percent increase in volume. Local price gains were driven by strong adoption of new Seed technology, including price execution in Latin America and EMEA, with corn price up 5 percent globally. These gains were partially offset by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, where price was down 2 percent. The increase in volume was driven by strong demand for corn in Brazil, coupled with higher soybean and corn sales in North America.
Seed operating EBITDA was $1,512 million in 2021, up 25 percent from $1,208 million in 2020. Continued price execution, volume gains, ongoing cost and productivity actions, lower royalties, and lower bad debt expense more than offset higher input costs, higher freight and warehousing costs, and higher variable compensation costs.
Seed net sales were $7,756 million in 2020, up 2 percent from $7,590 million in 2019. The increase was driven by a 5 percent increase in volume and 1 percent increase in price, partially offset by a 4 percent unfavorable impact from currency. Volume growth was driven by the recovery of soybean planted area in North America and strong summer and Safrinha sales in Brazil. Global corn price grew 2 percent year over year, primarily driven by continued penetration from products such as Qrome® and PowerCore ULTRATM. North America soybean price increased 2 percent versus the year-ago period due to superior product performance and strong execution. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real.
Seed operating EBITDA was $1,208 million in 2020, up 16 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $1,040 million in 2019. Favorable mix, volume gains and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset the unfavorable impact of currency, higher input costs and higher royalties.

Crop Protection
Crop protection net sales were $7,253 million in 2021, up 12 percent from $6,461 million in 2020. The increase was due to a 6 percent increase in volume, a 5 percent increase in price and a 2 percent favorable impact from currency, partially offset by a 1 percent unfavorable portfolio impact.
Volume gains were led by continued penetration of new products globally, with combined sales of over $1.4 billion in 2021, up nearly $450 million compared to the prior-year period, led by EnlistTM and ArylexTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide. These volume gains were partially offset by an approximate $275 million impact from the company's decision to phase out select low-margin products.
The increase in price was primarily driven by gains in North America and Latin America, including pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs. Favorable currency impacts were primarily from the Euro. The portfolio impact was driven by a divestiture in Asia Pacific.
Crop protection operating EBITDA was $1,202 million in 2021, up 20 percent from $1,004 million from 2020. Pricing execution, continued penetration of new products, ongoing cost and productivity actions, and a favorable impact from currency more than offset higher input costs, including raw material and logistical costs, and higher variable compensation costs.
Crop protection net sales were $6,461 million in 2020, up from $6,256 million in 2019. Sales gains were driven by a 7 percent increase in volume and a 4 percent increase in price, which was partially offset by a 7 percent impact from currency and a 1 percent impact from portfolio.
The increase in volume was driven by continued penetration of new products globally, with combined sales of $1 billion in 2020, up $265 million compared to the prior-year period, led by EnlistTM, ArylexTM, and RinskorTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide. Local price growth was driven by increases in Latin America to offset currency, coupled with favorable mix globally from new product launches. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real. The Company has recognized approximately $150 million in pricing to offset the weakening Brazilian Real for the full year. The portfolio impact was driven by divestitures in Asia Pacific and North America.
Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $1,004 million in 2020, down from pro forma segment operating EBITDA of $1,066 million in 2019. Favorable mix, ongoing cost and productivity actions, together with volume gains, were more than offset by the negative impact of currency, increased investment to fund growth and higher input costs. Currency net of pricing was a $70 million headwind, inclusive of $150 million in pricing actions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include Operating EBITDA and operating earnings (loss) per share. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below. For the year ended December 31, 2019, information is on a pro forma basis and these non-GAAP measures are being reconciled to a pro forma GAAP financial measure prepared and presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments, which are reconciled to the GAAP reported figures. See Article 11 Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations on page 46.
Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Effective January 1, 2021, on a prospective basis, the company excludes from segment operating EBITDA net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB benefits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EID businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating earnings (loss) per share is defined as "earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations - diluted" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items, the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits (costs), the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont, and the after-tax impact of net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Although amortization of the company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

Reconciliation of Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations after Income Taxes to Operating EBITDA
1.Effective January 1, 2021, on a prospective basis, the company excludes net unrealized gains or losses from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. There were no unrealized mark-to-market (gains) losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Significant Items
1.The tax benefit impact of significant items for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a net tax charge of $35 million related to application of foreign tax provisions, a net tax charge of $146 million related to U.S. state blended tax rate changes associated with the Internal Reorganizations, and a net tax benefit of $(102) million related to an internal legal entity restructuring associated with the Internal Reorganizations. Unless specifically addressed above, the income tax effect on significant items was calculated based upon the enacted tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.
2.The tax only significant item benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a net benefit for the impact of changes in valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax asset positions of two legal entities in Brazil of $(57) million and $44 million, as well as an adjustment related to the impacts of Swiss Tax Reform of $4 million. The tax only significant item benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the impacts of the recognition of an elective cantonal component of the recent enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ("Swiss Tax Reform") ($(182) million benefit) and a benefit due to an elective change in accounting method that alters the 2019 impact of the business separation on foreign tax provisions ($(29) million benefit), partially offset by a state tax valuation allowance in the U.S. based on a change in judgment about the realizability of a deferred tax asset ($19 million charge).

The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned to EID are as follows:
1.In addition, Corteva, Inc. has been assigned a long-term issuer credit rating of A- with Stable outlook by Standard & Poor's and an Issuer Default Rating of A with Stable outlook by Fitch Ratings.
The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its operations, including seasonal working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and pension obligations. Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. Corteva considers the borrowing costs and lending terms when selecting the source to fund its operations and working capital needs.
The company had access to approximately $6.4 billion in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These facilities provide support to meet the company’s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases and redemptions of securities and funding Corteva's costs and expenses.
On January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EID entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes originating from the Delaware Litigation and Pending Arbitration, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement and escrow account to be used to support and manage potential future legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the “MOU”). The MOU replaces the 2017 amendment to the Chemours Separation Agreement. According to the terms of the cost sharing arrangement within the MOU, Corteva and DuPont together, on one hand, and Chemours, on the other hand, agreed to a 50-50 split of certain qualified expenses related to PFAS liabilities incurred over a term not to exceed twenty years or $4 billion of qualified spend and escrow account contributions in the aggregate. DuPont’s and Corteva’s 50% share under the MOU will be limited to $2 billion, including qualified expenses and escrow contributions (see below for discussion of escrow contributions). These expenses and escrow account contributions will be subject to the existing Letter Agreement, under which DuPont and Corteva will each bear 50% of the first $300 million (up to $150 million each), and thereafter DuPont bears 71% and Corteva bears the remaining 29%.
In order to support and manage any potential future PFAS liabilities, the parties have also agreed to establish an escrow account. The MOU provides that (1) no later than each of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, Chemours shall deposit $100 million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit $100 million in the aggregate into an escrow account and (2) no later than September 30 of each subsequent year through and including 2028, Chemours shall deposit $50 million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit $50 million in the aggregate into an escrow account. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, each party may be permitted to defer funding in any year (excluding 2021). Over this period, Chemours will deposit a total of $500 million in the account and DuPont and Corteva will deposit an additional $500 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the escrow account (including interest) is less than $700 million, Chemours will make 50% of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva together will make 50% of the deposits necessary to restore the balance of the escrow account to $700 million. Such payments will be made in a series of consecutive annual equal installments commencing on September 30, 2029 pursuant to the escrow account replenishment terms as set forth in the MOU. During 2021, the company contributed is initial deposit into the MOU Escrow Account, which is classified as noncurrent restricted cash equivalents and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the MOU and Letter Agreement.

In November 2018, EID entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facilities”). The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities became effective May 2019. Corteva, Inc. became a party at the time of the Corteva Distribution. In May 2021, the company entered into an amendment that extended the maturity date of the 3-year revolving credit facility from May 2022 to May 2023. Other than the change in maturity date, there were no material modifications to the terms of the credit facility. The Revolving Credit Facilities may serve as a substitute to the company's commercial paper program, and can be used, from time to time, for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. The Revolving Credit Facilities also contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2021 the company was in compliance with these covenants.
In March 2020, the company drew down $500 million under the three-year revolving credit facility to finance its short term liquidity needs as a result of the volatility and increased borrowing costs of commercial paper resulting from the unstable market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and repaid that borrowing in full in June 2020.
In May 2020, EID issued $500 million of 1.70 percent Senior Notes due 2025 and $500 million of 2.30 percent Senior Notes due 2030 (the May 2020 Debt Offering). The proceeds of this offering are intended to be used for general corporate purposes.
The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions.
The company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including cash, commercial paper, a receivable repurchase facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, and factoring.
In February 2021, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1 billion (the "2021 Repurchase Facility") which expired in December 2021. Under the 2021 Repurchase Facility, Corteva sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date.
In February 2022, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $500 million (the "2022 Repurchase Facility") which expires in December 2022. See further discussion of the 2022 Repurchase Facility in Note 26 - Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 12 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of its seed and crop protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information on the company’s guarantees.
Capacity Expansion
During 2021, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $113 million increase in the capital investment (approximately $260 million in total) for the previously announced expansion of Spinosyns fermentation capacity. The 30 percent increase in capacity is staged to come online over the next several years. Higher capital investment is primarily due to updated design requirements impacting materials, labor and engineering costs.

Debt Redemptions/Repayments
On March 22, 2019, EID issued notices of redemption in full of all of its outstanding notes (the “Make Whole Notes”) listed in the table below:
The Make Whole Notes were redeemed on April 22, 2019 at the make-whole redemption prices set forth in the respective Make Whole Notes. On and after the date of redemption, the Make Whole Notes were no longer deemed outstanding, interest on the Make Whole Notes ceased to accrue and all rights of the holders of the Make Whole Notes were terminated. For further information on the Make Whole Notes, see Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2016, EID entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as amended, from time to time, the "Term Loan Facility") under which EID could make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid were not available for subsequent borrowings. On May 2, 2019, EID terminated its Term Loan Facility and repaid the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest through and including May 1, 2019. For further information on the termination of the Term Loan Facility, see Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In connection with the repayment of the Make Whole Notes and the Term Loan Facility, EID paid a total of $4.6 billion in the second quarter 2019, which included breakage fees and accrued and unpaid interest on the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility. The repayment of the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility was funded with cash from operations and a contribution from DowDuPont.
On May 7, 2019, DowDuPont publicly announced the record date in connection with the Corteva Distribution. In connection with such announcement, EID was required to redeem $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.200% Notes due 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (collectively, the Special Mandatory Redemption or “SMR Notes”) setting forth the date of redemption of the SMR Notes. The date of redemption was May 17, 2019 and EID paid a total of $2.0 billion, which included accrued and unpaid interest on the SMR Notes. The company funded the payment with a contribution from DowDuPont. Following the redemption, the SMR Notes are no longer outstanding and no longer bear interest and all rights of the holders of the SMR Notes have terminated.
The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of which $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2021, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. with global operating cash flows, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities, and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets.

The increase in cash provided by (used for) operating activities was driven by an increase in net income, and improvement in working capital primarily driven by higher customer prepayments and higher accounts payable.
Cash provided by (used for) operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,064 million compared to $1,070 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by (used for) operating activities was driven by an increase in net income, including a decrease in integration and separation costs, and improvement in working capital, partially offset by the absence of the net impact of cash earnings from EID ECP and EID Specialty Products entities, as a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019.
Cash provided by (used for) investing activities was $(362) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(674) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to lower purchases of investments and proceeds of marketable securities, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.
Cash provided by (used for) investing activities was $(674) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $(904) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to lower capital expenditures driven by the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019, partially offset by higher net purchases of investments and lower proceeds from sales of property, businesses, and consolidated companies.
Capital expenditures totaled $573 million, $475 million, and $1,163 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes capital expenditures of $497 million, related to the EID Specialty Products and EID ECP (i.e., ethylene copolymers business, excluding its ethylene acrylic elastomers business) Entities. The company expects 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $645 million.
Cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $(1,266) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to lower borrowings and higher repurchases of Corteva common stock.
Cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $(2,929) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to lower payments on long-term debt, due to the 2019 debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (using a portion of the contributions from DowDuPont), lower net payment on borrowings (less than 90 days), the May 2020 Debt Offering, and the absence of distributions to DowDuPont (which in 2019 were used primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments). This was partially offset by dividends to Corteva stockholders, repurchases of Corteva common stock and payments for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019 there was a transfer of cash to DowDuPont as part of the Internal Reorganizations.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
Part II
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits
Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.
Substantially all of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. The weighted average discount rates used in developing the 2022 net periodic pension and OPEB costs are expected to be 2.82 percent and 2.59 percent, respectively.
Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining the 2021 net periodic pension cost in the U.S., 5.75 percent of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was used. After re-evaluating the current strategic asset allocation and recent market conditions, the company lowered the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption to 4.50 percent to be used in determining the 2022 net periodic pension cost in the U.S. Consistent with prior years, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets.
In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months, however, as a result of the Merger, the market-related value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from September 1, 2017 through the year ended December 31, 2019.
The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:
For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.

The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021:
Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under "Long-term Employee Benefits" beginning on page 65 and in Note 20 - Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental Matters
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2021, the company had accrued obligations of $452 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $68 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $592 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal Contingencies
The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Indemnification Assets
The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and / or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the
Part II
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to indemnifications.
Income Taxes
The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.
Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2021, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $782 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $366 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.
Valuation of Assets and Impairment Considerations
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.
Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.
The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management.
Part II
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The company’s reporting units include seed, crop protection and digital.
For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.
If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill associated with the reporting unit. The company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs, or the market approach.
Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategy and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the company’s valuations ranged from 9.25 percent to 16.5 percent. Under the market approach, the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies.
Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2021, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20 percent, and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary.
Prepaid Royalties
The company’s seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty.
At December 31, 2021, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $303 million and $256 million, respectively. The majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.’s (“Pioneer”) non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto Company's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies,
Part II
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company accelerated the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the subsequent five years. During the ramp-up period, the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). The rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized.
In connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio, beginning January 1, 2020 the company presents and discloses the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the company recognized $125 million in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. The expected non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2022 is approximately $102 million, aggregating to approximately $235 million over the next 3 years.
Further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement, including the Transition Plan, could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Certain Guarantee Contracts
Information with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not made significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.
Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments consist of long-term debt, operating and finance lease obligations and environmental remediation obligations. Refer to further discussion on long-term debt and operating and finance lease obligations in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities and Note 16 - Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. Refer to discussion on environmental remediation obligations on page 68 of this report.
Information related to the company's other significant contractual obligations are summarized in the following table:
1.Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement.
2.Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
3. Represents undiscounted remaining payments under Pioneer license agreements ($305 million on a discounted basis).
4. Includes liabilities related to employee-related benefits other than pension and other post employment benefits, asset retirement obligations and other noncurrent liabilities.
5. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Long-term Employee Benefits
The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees ("other post employment benefits" or "OPEB"). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans.
Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.
Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018, resulting in the participants no longer accruing additional benefits. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who were under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.
In September 2021, the company transferred approximately $250 million of certain benefit obligations and related assets associated with the principal U.S. pension plan to an insurance company through the purchase of nonparticipating group annuity contracts. The company may consider additional annuity purchases in the future.
In December 2020, the company amended its retiree medical, dental and life insurance plans resulting in the company no longer providing retiree dental and life insurance benefits effective January 1, 2022 and Corteva’s portion of the cost of non-Medicare retiree medical coverage no longer being adjusted for cost increases, which capped the Corteva cost at the level as of December 31, 2021 ("2020 OPEB Plan Amendments"). As a result of these changes, the company recorded a $(939) million decrease in OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021, a substantial amount of the prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) in 2020 was recognized in other income - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $8 million, $9 million, and $39 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $41 million, $53 million, and $82 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $198 million, $207 million, and $202 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net

impact of per capita health care cost, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.
In 2022, the company expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan and approximately $140 million to its OPEB plans. The company does not anticipate making contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2022.
The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:
1.The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a charge of $33 million for the company contributions to be paid in 2022, which was included in accrued and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee benefit plan credits were $(1,167) million and $(213) million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change is due to the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments and lower discount rates. See "Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 60 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.
For 2022, long-term employee benefits credit is expected to decrease by about $1 billion. The decrease is mainly due to the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments, an increase in the discount rates, and a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 5.75 percent to 4.50 percent.
Environmental Matters
The company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.
Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below:
1.Environmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the $200 million threshold and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header Corteva Separation Agreement.
Environmental Operating Costs
As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including
Part II
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.
About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
Remediation Accrual
Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:
1.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.
2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EID's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and subsequent MOU, and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.
Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $592 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2021. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.
Part II
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued
The above noted $452 million accrued obligations includes the following:
1.Represents liabilities that are subject to the $200 million threshold and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header "Corteva Separation Agreement."
2.The company has recorded an indemnification asset related to these accruals, including $40 million related to the Superfund sites.
3.Accrual balance represents management’s best estimate of the costs of remediation and restoration, although it is reasonably possible that the potential exposure, as indicated, could range above the amounts accrued, as there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates. Accrual balance includes $68 million for remediation of Superfund sites. Amounts do not include possible impacts from the remediation elements of the EPAs October 2021 PFAS Strategic Roadmap (as applicable) or possible revisions to Chemours’ Consent Order with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, as any possible impacts, to the extent such items would be reimbursable under the MOU, are not yet determinable.
4.Represents liabilities that are subject to the $150 million threshold and sharing agreements as discussed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header "Chemours/ Performance Chemicals."
5.Included accrued obligations of $133 million due in the next twelve months with the remainder being due subsequent to 2022.
As of December 31, 2021, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 130 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 70 of the 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in "de minimis buyouts" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. There were no new notices in 2021 or 2020.
Environmental Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $9 million in 2022.
Climate Change
The company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives.
Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.
Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on our customers’ ability to use the company's products, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for

existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its overall risk management.
The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company's businesses, strategy and financial planning and are presented in the 14 ten-year sustainability goals that were set in 2020. For each goal, the company established key performance indicators and criteria to achieve the goals, which are provided on the company's website at: https://www.corteva.com/sustainability.html. The information contained on the company’s website is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the company’s other SEC filings.
As demonstrated by the goals, Corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses while enabling a more resilient agriculture value chain. Corteva has an established climate strategy, including appropriate Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas reduction targets. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability.
The company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people. By doing more to address climate change today, the company is fortifying its ability to grow food, grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come.
