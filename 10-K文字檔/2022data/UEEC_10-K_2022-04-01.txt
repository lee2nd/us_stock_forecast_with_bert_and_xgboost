This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Results of Operations years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Year ended December 31, 2021 versus year ended December 31, 2020
During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $59 and $643 of revenues, respectively. The minimal revenues are due to the continued focus of the Company’s capital and resources towards obtaining a Class III PMA.
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $29,800,669 and $14,849,099, respectively. The increase in operating expenses is due primarily to a $14,138,292 increase in stock-based compensation expense, $69,649 write-off of inventory, $101,350 write-off of property and equipment and $682,000 of litigation settlement expense during 2021 (see Note 7 to the financial statements) which the Company did not have in 2020.
The increase in stock-based compensation is primarily related to vesting and amortization of RSUs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company amended the RSU agreement with its former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. The amendment resulted in the vesting of 21,970,000 RSUs along with the issuance of an additional 2,000,000 shares of restricted stock as a bonus. The change in vesting and issuance of the bonus shares of common stock resulted in the immediate recognition of $26,127,300 in stock-based compensation expense. The Company also recognized $43,121 of stock-based compensation due to the amortization of the RSUs that vested on January 1, 2021, issued 100,000 shares of common stock for settlement of a consulting agreement valued at $111,000, issued 125,000 shares of common stock for services valued at $102,500 and issued 560,000 shares of common stock valued at $477,175 due to vesting of RSUs.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $12,420,930 of stock-based compensation related to an amendment to the restricted stock award agreement made during the year. The amendment resulted in the vesting of 7,595,000 of restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and the immediate recognition of $5,392,450 of expenses and also $7,028,480 of stock-based compensation due to the amortization of the RSUs that vested on January 1, 2021. The Company also issued 425,000 shares of common stock for services with a value of $301,875.
Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(748,548) and $(862,749), respectively. The increase in other expense was due to total interest expense of $618,251 and loss on debt settlement of $434,570 offset by other income of $304,273. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the amortization of beneficial conversion features on convertible notes payable and convertible notes payable - related party during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaling $608,710 compared to $535,766 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The loss on debt settlement is due to the Company issuing shares of common stock with a fair value of $1,205,718 for the settlement of $771,148 of various debts and accrued liabilities - related party. Other income is due to the Company receiving $304,273 as full and final payment for settlement of its December 2019 arbitration with Maxim.
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $30,549,183 as compared to a net loss of $15,711,400 for the prior year. The increase in the net loss is due to an increase in stock-based stock compensation of $14,138,292, $69,649 write-off of inventory, $101,350 write-off of property and equipment and an increase in litigation settlement expenses of $682,000 compared to the prior year for the reasons described above.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a negative working capital of $1,141,894. The Company has not yet attained a level of operations, and for the foreseeable future will not be pursuing commercial operations, which will allow it to meet its current overhead expense obligations. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our 2021 and 2020 financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company has funded its initial operations with private placements, and unsecured loans from related parties, there can be no assurance that adequate financing will continue to be available to the Company and, if available, on terms that are favorable to the Company. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on many events outside of our direct control, including, among other things, our ability to achieve our business goals and objectives, as well as improvement in the economic climate.
Cash Flows
The Company’s cash on hand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $21,799 and $46,076, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its HemoStyp product by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company receives orders for its HemoStyp products directly from its customers. Revenues are recognized based on the agreed upon sales or transaction price with the customer when control of the promised goods are transferred to the customer. The transfer of goods to the customer and satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation will occur either at the time when products are shipped or when the products arrive and are received by the customer. No discounts were offered by the Company. The Company does not provide an estimate for returns as there is no anticipation for any returns in the normal course of business.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or liabilities incurred, whichever is more reliably measured. Share-based compensation for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The Company accounts for stock compensation arrangements with non-employees in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at the value on the grant date.
