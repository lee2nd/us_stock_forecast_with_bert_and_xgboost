Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Effects of the Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, have and could continue to adversely affect the Company, and the Company’s customers and suppliers as a result of quarantines, facility closures, closing of “brick and mortar” retail outlets and logistics restrictions imposed or which otherwise occur in connection with the pandemic. More broadly, the high degree of unemployment resulting from the pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products and services and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the effect the long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020
Revenues. We had net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3,081,792, as compared to $6,225,848 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease reflects a significant contraction of retail sales in 2021 from 2020, primarily as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales include bulk oils for wholesale, capsules, gummies, tinctures, lotions, salves, creams, balm sticks, lip balms and pet chews, all in various potency levels and flavors. We co-package in addition to marketing our own Veritas Farms brand product line.
Cost of Sales. All expenses incurred to grow, process, and package the finished goods are included in our cost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $4,108,133 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $3,268,249 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of an inventory write down which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. We had gross (expense) of ($1,026,341) for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to gross margin of $2,957,599 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $6,300,733 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $10,420,569 for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the significant reduction in marketing expenses, as well as the reduction in the number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2021 in addition to a significant reduction in our stock-based compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative personnel costs, facilities expenses, professional fee expenses and marketing costs for our Veritas Farms brand products.
Interest expense was $86,645 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $129,569 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense incurred to related parties was $65,650 during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in interest expense for both periods is the accretion of discounts recorded related to financial instrument derivatives that were deemed a part of the financings that we entered into.
Net (Loss). As a result of the decrease in operating, marketing and public company expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased to ($7,263,567) or ($0.17) per share based on 43,377,832 weighted average shares outstanding, from ($7,592,539) or ($0.18) per share based on 42,586,651 weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash. We have historically experienced negative cash flows and have relied on the proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities to fund our operations. In addition, we have utilized stock-based compensation as a means of paying for consulting and salary related expenses. At December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $1,832,595.
Cash increased to $481,763 at December 31, 2021 from $107,693 at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to cash provided by financing activities.
As of December 31, 2021, total assets were $8,597,840, as compared to $12,408,021 at December 31, 2020. Assets primarily decreased due to decreases in accounts receivable, inventories and right of use assets.
Total liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were $3,772,555, as compared to $4,760,654 at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due in large part to decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, right of use lease liability.
Net cash used in operating activities increased to $4,755,792 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $2,969,075 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Results of operations, offset by decreases in inventories, accounts payable stock-based compensation comprised most of the change.
Net cash used in investing activities was $80,289 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $88,038 for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting a decrease in cash used for the purchase of property and equipment in 2021.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $5,210,151 for year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $803,994 from a loan received under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program as part of the business incentives offered in the CARES Act received in February 2021, and net proceeds of $86,895 and $3,665,440 from private offerings of our equity securities. This compares to net cash provided by financing activities of $2,088,263 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:
(1) Amounts do not include interest to be paid.

Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources; Debt Obligations
Our primary sources of capital to develop and implement our business plan and expand our operations have been the proceeds from private offerings of our equity securities, PPP loans, capital contributions made by members prior to completion of the September 2017 271 Lake Davis Acquisition by the Company and loans from stockholders.
In March 2020, the Company received a $200,000 loan from a single investor, evidenced by a one-year convertible promissory note (“Convertible Note”). The Convertible Note bears interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, which accrues and is payable together with principal at maturity. Principal and accrued interest under the Convertible Note may, at the option of the holder, be converted in its entirety into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.40 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar recapitalization transactions. On May 14, 2021, the Company paid $20,000 in accrued interest to the holder, and the Company and the investor extended the maturity date of the Convertible Note to September 6, 2021. In September 2021, the Company and the investor further extended the maturity date of the Convertible Note to October 1, 2022.
In September 2020, the Company commenced a $4.0 million private offering of up to 8,000,000 Units (“Units”) at a price of $0.50 per Unit, which private offering ended April 30, 2021. Each Unit consists of (a) two shares of common stock; and (b) one warrant, entitling the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 at any time through August 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, the Company sold 2,080,000 Units in the private offering for gross proceeds of $1,040,000 with offering costs of $154,965 resulting in net proceeds of $885,035. From January 1, 2021 through April 30, 2021, the Company sold an additional 200,000 Units for gross proceeds of $100,000 with offering costs of $13,105 resulting in net proceeds of $86,895. The terms of this offering provided that, if during the one-year period from the final closing of the offering, the Company undertakes a subsequent private offering of its equity, equity equivalent or debt securities (a “Subsequent Offering”), the investor will be entitled to exchange their Units purchased in the offering for an equivalent dollar amount of securities sold in the Subsequent Offering (based on the respective offering prices). The Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with these investors which states, among other things, that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering, among other things, the resale of all or such portion of the registrable securities that are not then registered on an effective registration statement. As of December 31, 2021, all Unit holders converted their Units to Series A Preferred Shares.
On May 11, 2021, the Company consummated the issuance and sale of the Preferred Shares to the Wit Trust described under “Business - Our Background” above, which generated gross proceeds of $2,000,000 (including certain bridge financing previously furnished by the Wit Trust to the Company in April 2021).
On September 30, 2021, the Company completed a private offering which commenced on August 5, 2021 of Series A Preferred Shares to certain investors, pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 2,000,000 Series A Preferred Shares at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (“2021 Private Placement”) in exchange for (i) the payment of $1,860,000 (including $1,644,068.49 principal plus accrued but unpaid interest in bridge financing provided by certain investors during April, July and August 2021 upon the conversion of the investors’ secured convertible promissory notes, and conversion of an account payable); and (ii) the surrender of 280,000 Units. The investors in the 2021 Private Placement included: Mr. Johnson upon the conversion of $50,000 promissory note; Mr. Pino upon the conversion of $25,000 promissory note; Mr. Vickers upon conversion of $50,000 promissory note and accounts payable; Mr. van der Post, a member of the Board of Director of the Company, in the amount of $50,000, and; the Wit Trust, in the amount of $65,931.51 and upon conversion of $1,500,000 secured convertible promissory notes and $19,068.49 in accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the 2021 Private Placement and the voting rights accorded the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares, the Wit Trust now holds approximately 88% of the voting power of the Company.
On October 12, 2021, the Company issued a secured convertible credit line promissory note in the principal amount for up to $1,500,000 (the “Secured Convertible Promissory Note”), which Secured Convertible Promissory Note was issued to the Wit Trust. The Secured Convertible Promissory Note is secured by the Company’s assets and contain certain covenants and customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in an acceleration of the Secured Convertible Promissory Note. The Secured Convertible Promissory Note is convertible as follows: aggregate loaned principal and accrued interest under the Secured Convertible Promissory Note may, at the option of the holder, be converted in its entirety into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.05 per share. The Secured Convertible Promissory Note will accrue interest on the aggregate amount loaned at a rate of 10% per annum. All unpaid principal, together with any then unpaid and accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Secured Convertible Promissory Note, is due and payable if not converted pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Secured Convertible Promissory Note on the earlier of (i) October 1, 2024, or (ii) following an event of default.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP in the United States, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has sustained substantial losses from operations since its inception. As of and for the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of ($33,930,714) and a net loss of ($7,263,567). These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Continuation as a going concern is dependent on the ability to raise additional capital and financing until we can achieve a level of operational profitability, though there is no assurance of success.
The Company believes that it will require additional financing to fund its growth and achieve profitability The Company anticipates that such financing will be generated from subsequent private offerings of its equity and/or debt securities. While we believe additional financing will be available to us as needed, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, when needed. Moreover, any such additional financing may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. The absence of additional financing, when needed, could substantially harm the Company, its business, results of operations and financial condition.
Capital Expenditures
Any amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately service any increase in our business. To date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future.
Presently, we have approximately $20,000 planned for capital expenditures to further develop the Company’s infrastructure to allow for growth in our operations over the next 12 months. We expect to fund these capital expenditure needs through a combination of vendor provided financing, the use of operating or capital equipment
leases and cash provided from operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Factors Affecting Future Performance
Item 1A of this report sets forth risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. If any of these risks, or any risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.
Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Purchases of property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation is recognized over the estimated economic useful lives of each class of assets and is computed using the straight-line method.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the amortization period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal and external factors relating to each asset, including cash flows, local market developments, industry trends and other publicly available information. If these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the Company over the remaining amortization period indicate that the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value will be adjusted to the fair market value.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include deferred revenue, costs incurred related to deferred revenue, the useful lives of property and equipment and the useful lives of intangible assets.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, (“ASC 740”). Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.
In accordance with ASC 740, management evaluated the Company’s tax positions and concluded that the Company had taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the financial statements to comply with the provisions of this guidance. The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress.
Effective September 27, 2017, the Company became taxed as a C-Corporation. Income tax benefits are recognized for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, only when it is determined that the income tax position will more-likely than-not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company has analyzed tax positions taken for filings with the Internal Revenue Service and all tax jurisdictions where it operates. The Company believes that income tax filing positions will be sustained upon examination and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any reserves, or related accruals for interest and penalties for uncertain income tax positions at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
