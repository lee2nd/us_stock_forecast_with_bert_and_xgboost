Industry Factors and Market Conditions
Within the nitrogen fertilizer business, earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, utilization, and operating costs and expenses, including pet coke and natural gas feedstock costs.
The price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and
December 31, 2021 | 30
production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.
Nitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors’ facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments, and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.
General Business Environment
Throughout 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments and others in response thereto negatively impacted the worldwide economy, financial markets, and the agricultural industry, resulting in significant business and operational disruptions. Consequently, the U.S. demand for liquid transportation fuels, including ethanol (the production of which is a significant driver of demand for corn), declined, causing many refineries and plants to reduce production or idle. During 2021, government restrictions eased, vaccines became available, and demand for transportation fuels increased. Demand for ethanol for fuels blending has largely recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels, although an increase in outbreaks of any variant of COVID-19 could reverse this recovery. Concerns over the long-term negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and business prospects across the world have contributed to increased market and grain price volatility and have diminished expectations for the global economy.
The Partnership believes the general business environment in which it operates will continue to remain volatile into 2022, driven by uncertainty around the availability and prices of its feedstocks, demand for its products, and global supply disruptions. As a result, future operating results and current and long-term financial conditions could be negatively impacted if economic conditions decline, remain volatile, and do not return to pre-pandemic levels. Due to the uncertainty of the global recovery, including its duration, timing, and strength, the Partnership is not able at this time to predict the extent to which these events may have a material, or any, effect on its financial or operational results in future periods.
Market Indicators
While there is risk of shorter-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the Partnership believes the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The Partnership views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn and soybeans as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and other renewable fuels, and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve should provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S. over the longer term.
Corn and soybeans are two major crops planted by farmers in North America. Corn crops result in the depletion of the amount of nitrogen within the soil in which it is grown, which in turn, results in the need for this nutrient to be replenished after each growing cycle. Unlike corn, soybeans are able to obtain most of their own nitrogen through a process known as “N fixation.” As such, upon harvesting of soybeans, the soil retains a certain amount of nitrogen which results in lower demand for nitrogen fertilizer for the following corn planting cycle. Due to these factors, nitrogen fertilizer consumers generally operate a balanced corn-soybean rotational planting cycle as evident through the chart presented below for 2021, 2020, and 2019.
The relationship between the total acres planted for both corn and soybean has a direct impact on the overall demand for nitrogen products, as the market and demand for nitrogen increases with increased corn acres and decreases with increased soybean acres. Additionally, an estimated 11 billion pounds of soybean oil is expected to be used in producing cleaner biodiesel in marketing year 2021/2022. Multiple refiners have announced renewable diesel expansion projects for 2022 and beyond, which will only increase the demand for soybeans and potentially for corn and canola. Due to the uncertainty of how these factors will truly affect the grain markets, it is not yet known how the nitrogen business will be impacted.
The 2021 United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) reports on corn and soybean acres planted indicated farmers planted 93.4 million acres of corn, representing an increase of 3.0% in corn acres planted as compared to 90.7 million corn acres in 2020. Planted soybean acres are estimated to be 87.2 million acres, representing a 4.6% increase in soybean acres planted as compared to 83.4 million soybean acres in 2020. The combined corn and soybean planted acres of 180.6 million is
December 31, 2021 | 31
the highest in history. Based on current grain inventories and crop prices, farm economics are expected to continue to be very attractive in 2022.
Ethanol is blended with gasoline to meet renewable fuel standard requirements and for its octane value. Ethanol production has historically consumed approximately 35% of the U.S. corn crop, so demand for corn generally rises and falls with ethanol demand. There was a decline in ethanol demand that began in 2020 and continued through 2021 due to decreased demand for transportation fuels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the lower ethanol demand did not alter the spring 2021 planting decisions by farmers as evidenced in the charts below.
(1)Information used within this chart was obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”).
(2)Information used within this chart was obtained from the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Services.
Weather continues to be a critical variable for crop production. Grain prices rose significantly from the summer of 2020 into the spring of 2021, leading to higher planted acreage for corn and soybeans. Even with higher planted acres and trendline yields per acre, inventory levels for corn and soybeans remain below historical levels and prices have remained elevated. The higher grain prices and historically low crop inventories are leading to strong farm economics in advance of spring 2022. These conditions are expected to drive strong demand for nitrogen fertilizer, as well as other crop inputs.
Fertilizer prices have risen significantly since January 1, 2021 due to strong grain prices, the strong spring 2021 planting season, and lower fertilizer supply due to nitrogen fertilizer production outages during Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida and significant escalation in global feedstock costs for nitrogen fertilizer production. While natural gas prices were at historical lows across the world in 2020, they have escalated significantly since the summer of 2021, causing nitrogen fertilizer production to be reduced or shut-in in Europe. In addition to escalating coal and LNG prices in China, nitrogen fertilizer exports have been reduced significantly in the second half of 2021 and are expected to continue to be reduced through the first half of 2022.
On June 30, 2021, CF Industries Nitrogen, L.L.C., Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership, and Terra International (Oklahoma) LLC filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (“USDOC”) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) requesting the initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on imports of UAN from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago (“Trinidad”). In August 2021, USDOC decided to pursue an investigation to determine the extent of dumping and unfair subsidies associated with imports from Russia and Trinidad, and the ITC initiated a concurrent investigation to determine whether such imports materially injure the U.S. industry. On November 30, 2021, USDOC determined that UAN imports from Russia are unfairly subsidized at rates ranging from 9.66% to 9.84% and UAN imports from Trinidad are unfairly subsidized at a rate of 1.83%. On January 27, 2022, USDOC found that Russian UAN imports are sold at less than fair value into the U.S. market at rates ranging from 9.15% to 127.19% and that Trinidadian UAN imports at a rate of 63.08%. As a result of these determinations, USDOC will impose cash deposit requirements on imports of UAN from Russia and Trinidad based on the preliminary rates of antidumping duties. We believe that if the antidumping and countervailing duty preliminary determinations are confirmed by USDOC, there will likely be lower amounts of imported UAN from Russia and Trinidad.

Results of Operations
The following should be read in conjunction with the information outlined within the previous sections of this Part II, Item 7, and the financial statements and related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.
The chart presented below summarizes our ammonia utilization rates on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Partnership’s facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons of ammonia produced divided by capacity adjusted for planned maintenance and turnarounds.
Utilization is presented solely on ammonia production rather than each nitrogen product as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of facility configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on ammonia upgrade capabilities, we believe this measure provides a meaningful view of how well we operate.
December 31, 2021 | 33
On a consolidated basis, utilization decreased 6% to 92% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to downtime associated with the Messer air separation plant at the Coffeyville Facility in January, June, August, October, and November of 2021 (the “Messer Outages”), downtime at the East Dubuque Facility due to Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, downtime at the Coffeyville Facility and East Dubuque Facility in July and September 2021, respectively, due to externally driven power outages (the “Power Outages”), and downtime at the East Dubuque Facility in October 2021 for an R2 repair (the “R2 Outage”).
Sales and Pricing per Ton - Two of our key operating metrics are total sales volumes for ammonia and UAN, along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate. Total product sales volumes were unfavorable, driven by lower production due to the Messer Outages, Winter Storm Uri, Power Outages, and the R2 Outage. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the lower sales volumes were more than offset by improved prices of 92% for ammonia and 74% for UAN. Ammonia and UAN sales prices were favorable primarily due to higher crop pricing coupled with lower fertilizer supply driven by production outages from Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 and Hurricane Ida in August and September 2021, as well as increased industry turnaround activity and lower global fertilizer production due to higher natural gas prices in Europe and Asia. Product pricing at the gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure comparable across the fertilizer industry.
Production Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products. Production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the Messer Outages, Winter Storm Uri, the Power Outages, and the R2 Outage. The table below presents these metrics for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands of tons) 2021 2020 2019
Ammonia (gross produced) 807 852 766
Ammonia (net available for sale) 275 303 223
UAN 1,208 1,303 1,255
Feedstock - Our Coffeyville Facility utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Our East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas in its production of ammonia. The table below presents these feedstocks for both facilities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

Financial Highlights
Overview - For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership’s operating income and net income were $134.5 million and $78.2 million, respectively, a $169.4 million increase from an operating loss and a $176.4 million increase from a net loss, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Beyond the goodwill impairment of $41.0 million negatively impacting the 2020 period, these income improvements were driven primarily by higher ammonia and UAN sales prices in 2021, partially offset by higher feedstock costs and operating expenses.

December 31, 2021 | 35
Net Sales - Net sales increased by $182.6 million to $532.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to favorable sales pricing contributing $205.1 million in higher revenue, offset by decreased sales volumes resulting in $35.4 million of lower revenue as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net sales included $31.4 million and $33.3 million in freight revenue, respectively, and $10.3 million and $10.1 million in other revenue, respectively.
The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales, excluding urea products, freight, and other revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, ammonia and UAN sales prices were favorable primarily due to higher crop pricing coupled with lower fertilizer supply driven by production outages from Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 and Hurricane Ida in August and September 2021, as well as increased industry turnaround activity and lower global fertilizer production due to higher natural gas prices in Europe and Asia during 2021. Total product sales volumes were unfavorable driven by lower production due to the Messer Outages, Winter Storm Uri, the Power Outages, and the R2 Outage.
(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.
Cost of Materials and Other - Cost of materials and other for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $98.3 million, compared to $91.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $7.2 million increase was comprised primarily of a $12.0 million increase in natural gas costs at our East Dubuque Facility due to higher natural gas prices, $4.5 million increase in pet coke costs at our Coffeyville Facility related to higher third-party coke pricing caused by higher crude oil prices and higher related party pet coke pricing due to the UAN-indexed pricing formula, and $1.5 million increase in purchases of hydrogen. These increases were offset by a decrease in freight expenses and distribution costs of $4.0 million due to downtime in October and November 2021 and a discontinuation of the Gavilon Railcar Lease in April 2021, a decrease related to a build in our ammonia and UAN inventories contributing $3.5 million, and a decrease in ammonia purchases of $3.3 million.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - For the year ended December 31, 2021, direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $198.7 million as compared to $157.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $40.8 million increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs for labor of $4.6 million and share-based compensation expenses of $15.6 million as a result of higher market prices for CVR Partners’ units, higher electrical provider pricing and usage of $13.7 million, higher natural gas prices of $9.9 million, higher insurance costs of $2.4 million, and increased turnaround expenses of $2.2 million. These costs were partially offset by a decrease related to a build in ammonia and UAN inventories of $7.8 million.
December 31, 2021 | 36
Depreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of inventory changes offset by increases in accelerated depreciation related to projects to be completed by 2025 that will retire assets earlier than their original expected useful life.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other increased approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily related to higher personnel costs in 2021 due to an increase in share-based compensation expenses resulting from the increase in CVR Partners’ unit price.
Other Income, Net - Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.7 million, compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to sales of natural gas volumes at the East Dubuque Facility in February 2021.
Non-GAAP Measures
Our management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, and reconciliations to those measures, to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.
Beginning with the second quarter of 2021, management began reporting Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below. We believe the presentation of this non-GAAP measure is meaningful to compare our operating results between periods and peer companies. All prior periods presented have been conformed to the definition below. The following are non-GAAP measures we present for the year ended December 31, 2021:
EBITDA - Net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.
Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for certain significant non-cash items and items that management believes are not attributable to or indicative of our on-going operations or that may obscure our underlying results and trends.
Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - Net cash provided by operating activities reduced by (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) change in working capital, and (iv) other non-cash adjustments.
Available Cash for Distribution - EBITDA for the quarter excluding non-cash income or expense items (if any), for which adjustment is deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of our general partner (the “Board”) in its sole discretion, less (i) reserves for maintenance capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, and (ii) reserves for future operating or capital needs (if any), in each case, that the Board deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion.
December 31, 2021 | 37
Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the Board.
We present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders, and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including, but not limited to, our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the fertilizer industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods, and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” included herein for reconciliation of these amounts. Due to rounding, numbers presented within this section may not add or equal to numbers or totals presented elsewhere within this document.
Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results
Our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below.
Major Scheduled Turnaround Activities
Coffeyville Facility - The next planned turnaround at the Coffeyville Facility is expected to commence in the summer of 2022. Additionally, the Coffeyville Facility had planned downtime which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2021 at a cost of $2.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we also incurred turnaround expense of $0.3 million, related to planning for the Coffeyville Facility’s expected turnaround in the summer of 2022.
East Dubuque Facility - The next planned turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility is expected to occur in the summer of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred turnaround expense of $0.6 million, related to planning for the East Dubuque Facility’s expected turnaround in the summer of 2022.
Goodwill Impairment
As a result of lower expectations for market conditions in the fertilizer industry during 2020, the market performance of the Partnership’s common units, a qualitative analysis, and additional risks associated with the business, the Partnership performed an interim quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill for the Coffeyville Facility reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. The results of the impairment test indicated the carrying amount of this reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value, and a full, non-cash impairment charge of $41.0 million was required.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal source of liquidity has historically been and continues to be cash from operations, which can include cash advances from customers resulting from prepay contracts. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations, and paying distributions to our unitholders, as further discussed below.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in U.S. economic activity in 2020 and 2021. These effects caused significant volatility and disruption of the financial markets, and we have observed adverse impacts to our business and financial performance, of which the nature and extent of such impacts remains uncertain. In early 2021, as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic started to recover, Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida caused unprecedented disruptions to natural gas and electricity supply throughout the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions, leading to lower fertilizer supply due to production outages which increased the price of fertilizer. This period of extreme economic disruption may continue to have an impact on our business, results of operations, and access to sources of liquidity. While we believe demand for our fertilizer products is stable, there is still uncertainty on the horizon as COVID-19 vaccines are distributed and countries and states continue to monitor their efforts against the virus, and variants thereof, and weigh further lock-down measures. In executing financial discipline, we have successfully implemented and are maintaining the following measures:
•Taking advantage of downtime to perform maintenance activities which enabled us to defer the East Dubuque Facility turnaround from 2021 to 2022; and
•Reducing the amount of maintenance capital expenditures to only include those projects which are a priority to support continuing safe and reliable operations, or which we consider are critical to support future activities.
When paired with the actions outlined above, we believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, rising material and labor costs and other inflationary pressures. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.
Depending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations, and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
On June 23, 2021, the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries completed a private offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due June 2028 (the “2028 Notes”), which mature on June 15, 2028, and partially redeemed the Partnership’s 9.25% Senior Notes due June 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) in the amount of $550.0 million. On September 23, 2021 and December 22, 2021, the Partnership redeemed an additional $15.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal of the 2023 Notes. On February 22, 2022, the Partnership redeemed the remaining $65 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. Collectively, these transactions represent a significant and favorable change in the Partnership’s cash flow and liquidity position, with an annual savings of approximately $26.0 million in future interest expense, as compared to our 2020 Form 10-K. Additionally, on September 30, 2021, the Partnership entered into a new credit agreement with an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million with a maturity date of September 30, 2024 (the “ABL Credit Facility”) and terminated its $35.0 million ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016, as amended (the “2016 ABL Credit Agreement”). The Partnership and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable covenants under their respective debt instruments as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 5 (“Long-Term Debt”) of this Report for further information.
We do not have any “off-balance sheet arrangements” as such term is defined within the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 5 (“Long-Term Debt”) of this Report for further information.
Capital Spending
We divide capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health, and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. We undertake growth capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed.
Our total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, along with our estimated expenditures for 2022 are as follows:
Year Ended December 31, Estimated
(in thousands) 2021 2020 2022
Maintenance capital $ 16,226 $ 11,651 $32,000 - 34,000
Growth capital 9,460 4,780 4,000 - 5,000
Total capital expenditures $ 25,686 $ 16,431 $36,000 - 39,000
Our estimated capital expenditures are subject to change due to unanticipated changes in the cost, scope, and completion time for capital projects. For example, we may experience unexpected changes in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the nitrogen fertilizer facilities. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined
December 31, 2021 | 41
by the Board. We will continue to monitor market conditions and make adjustments, if necessary, to our current capital spending or turnaround plans.
The next planned turnaround is at the Coffeyville Facility and is expected to occur in the summer of 2022, with an estimated cost of $10 to $13 million. The turnaround at our East Dubuque Facility is expected to commence in the summer of 2022, with an estimated cost of $13 to $15 million. Additionally, the Coffeyville Facility had planned downtime for certain maintenance activities, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 at a cost of $2.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we also incurred approximately $0.3 million and $0.6 million, in turnaround expense related to planning for the Coffeyville Facility’s and East Dubuque Facility’s expected turnarounds in 2022, respectively.
Distributions to Unitholders
The current policy of the Board is to distribute all Available Cash the Partnership generated on a quarterly basis. Available Cash for each quarter will be determined by the Board following the end of such quarter. Available Cash for each quarter is calculated as EBITDA for the quarter excluding non-cash income or expense items (if any), for which adjustment is deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board in its sole discretion, less (i) reserves for maintenance capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, and (ii) reserves for future operating or capital needs (if any), in each case, that the Board deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the Board.
Distributions, if any, including the payment, amount, and timing thereof, are subject to change at the discretion of the Board. The following table presents distributions paid by the Partnership to CVR Partners’ unitholders, including amounts paid to CVR Energy, as of December 31, 2021.
Distributions Paid (in thousands)
Related Period Date Paid Distribution Per
Common Unit Public Unitholders CVR Energy Total
2021 - 2nd Quarter August 23, 2021 $ 1.72 $ 11,678 $ 6,694 $ 18,372

Total distributions $ 4.65 $ 31,571 $ 18,098 $ 49,669
There were no distributions declared or paid by the Partnership related to the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2020, and no distributions were declared or paid during 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, CVR Partners paid distributions totaling $4.00 per common unit on a split-adjusted basis, or $45.3 million. Of these distributions, CVR Energy received $15.6 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, the Partnership, upon approval by the Board on February 21, 2022, declared a distribution of $5.24 per common unit, or $56.0 million, which is payable March 14, 2022 to unitholders of record as of March 7, 2022. Of this amount, CVR Energy will receive approximately $20.4 million, with the remaining amount payable to public unitholders.
Capital Structure
On May 6, 2020, the Board, on behalf of the Partnership, authorized a unit repurchase program (the “Unit Repurchase Program”). The Unit Repurchase Program enables the Partnership to repurchase up to $10 million of the Partnership’s common units. On February 22, 2021, the Board authorized an additional $10 million for the Unit Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership repurchased 24,378 common units on the open market in accordance with a repurchase agreement under Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a cost of $0.5 million, inclusive of transaction costs, or an average price of $21.70 per common unit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as adjusted to reflect the impact of the 1-for-10 reverse unit split of the Partnership’s common units that was effective as of November 23, 2020, the Partnership repurchased 623,177 common units, respectively, at a cost of $7.1 million, inclusive of transaction costs, or an average price of $11.35 per common unit. As of December 31, 2021, the Partnership had $12.4 million in authority remaining under the Unit Repurchase Program. This Unit Repurchase Program does not obligate the Partnership to acquire any common units and may be cancelled or terminated by the Board at any time.

Cash Flows
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below:
Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands) 2021 2020 2019
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 188,725 $ 19,740 $ 39,157
Investing activities (20,342) (18,550) (18,529)
Financing activities (86,426) (7,625) (45,410)
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 81,957 $ (6,435) $ (24,782)
Operating Activities
The change in net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to a $171.3 million increase in EBITDA, a $22.0 million net increase in non-cash share based compensation as a result of higher market prices for CVR Partners’ units, favorable changes in working capital of $6.7 million, and a $8.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt primarily associated with the partial redemption of the 2023 Notes in June 2021. This activity is partially offset by a non-cash impairment of goodwill of $41.0 million recognized in 2020.
Investing Activities
The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to increased capital expenditures during 2021 of $2.0 million due to deferring certain capital projects from 2020 to 2021.
Financing Activities
The change in net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the partial redemptions of the 2023 Notes of $580.0 million, cash distributions paid of $49.7 million, the payment of $3.9 million in deferred financing costs during the second and third quarters of 2021 related to the offering of the 2028 Notes and the ABL Credit Facility, and the redemption of the remaining 2021 Notes of $2.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the Partnership’s June 2021 offering of $550.0 million of the 2028 Notes, coupled with a reduction of $6.5 million in repurchases of the Partnership’s common units in 2021 compared to 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) of this Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to the Partnership.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requiring management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates based on the best available information at the time. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Inventory Valuation
The cost of our fertilizer product inventories is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Our FIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We compare the estimated realizable value of inventories to their cost by product at each of our facilities. Depending on inventory levels, the per-ton realizable value of our fertilizer
December 31, 2021 | 43
products is estimated using pricing on in-transit orders, pricing for open, fixed-price orders that have not shipped, and, if volumes remain unaccounted for, current management pricing estimates for fertilizer products. Management’s estimate for current pricing reflects up-to-date pricing in each facility’s market as of the end of each reporting period. Reductions to selling prices for unreimbursed freight costs are included to arrive at net realizable value, as applicable. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019, there was no adjustment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a loss on inventory to reflect net realizable value of $0.7 million. Due to the amount and variability in volume of fertilizer product inventories maintained, changes in production costs, and the volatility of market pricing for fertilizer products, losses recognized to reflect fertilizer product inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value could have a material impact on the Partnership’s results of operations.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill
Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets (for example, at a fertilizer facility level).
The Partnership tests goodwill for impairment annually on November 1 of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. One of our reporting units, the Coffeyville Facility, had a goodwill balance of $41.0 million at December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, following completion of the spring planting season, the market pricing for ammonia and UAN, which are the facility’s two primary products, experienced significant pricing declines driven by updated market expectations around supply and demand fundamentals which were expected to continue into the second half of 2020. Additionally, significant uncertainty remained as to the nature and extent of impacts to be seen on the overall demand for corn and soybean given reduced ethanol production and broader economic conditions which had negatively impacted demand. Therefore, in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2020, given the pricing declines experienced in the second quarter of 2020, further muting of our near-term economic recovery assumptions, including management’s revised forecasts for product pricing in 2020 and beyond, and market price performance of our common units, we concluded an impairment indicator was present and a triggering event under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, had occurred as of June 30, 2020 and an interim quantitative impairment assessment was performed. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for goodwill included, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, discount rates, inflationary factors, and cost of capital. Based on the interim quantitative analysis, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Coffeyville Facility reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $41.0 million during 2020. There was no goodwill remaining as of December 31, 2020.
We performed our annual impairment reviews of goodwill for 2019, on November 1 and concluded no impairments. For the period ended December 31, 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment and concluded there were no events or circumstances which would trigger the performance of a quantitative analysis after reviewing all factors impacting the Coffeyville Facility reporting unit, including improved market conditions and financial results in 2019 as compared to the financial forecasts from those used in the fair value analysis at December 31, 2018, where the estimated fair value of the Coffeyville Facility reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 36% based upon the results of our quantitative goodwill impairment test.
