ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and related notes. Some statements and information contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, “Business - Forward-Looking Statements.”
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our audited financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses Willamette Valley Vineyards’ financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, leases, investments, income taxes, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue - The Company’s principal sources of revenue are derived from direct sales and sales through distributors of wine. Distributor sales are recognized from wine sales at the time of shipment and passage of title. The Company’s payment arrangements with wholesalers provide primarily 30-day terms and, to a limited extent, 45-day, 60-day or longer terms for some international wholesalers. Direct sales from items sold through the Company’s retail locations are recognized at the time of sale.
The Company pays depletion allowances to the Company’s distributors based on their sales to their customers. The Company sets these allowances on a monthly basis and the Company’s distributors bill them back on a monthly basis. All depletion expenses associated with a given month are recognized in that month as a reduction of revenues. The Company also reimburses for samples used by distributors up to 1.5% of product sold to the distributors. Sample expenses are recognized at the time the Company is billed by the distributor as a selling, general and administrative expense.
Amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling expenses are included in the net revenue. Expenses incurred for outbound shipping and handling charges are included in selling, general and administrative expense.
Inventory - The Company values inventories at the lower of actual cost to produce the inventory or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and adjusts its production requirements for the next twelve months based on estimated forecasts of product demand. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In the future, if the Company’s inventory cost is determined to be greater than the net realizable value of the inventory upon sale, the Company would be required to recognize such excess costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Therefore, although the Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the ultimate selling price and cases sold and, therefore, the carrying value of the Company’s inventory and its reported operating results.
Additionally, the Company regularly evaluates inventory for obsolescence and marketability and if it determines that the inventory is obsolete, or no longer suitable for use or marketable, the cost of that inventory is recognized in cost of sales at the time of such determination.
Vineyard Development - The Company capitalizes internal vineyard development costs prior to the vineyard land becoming fully productive. These costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises. Amortization of such costs as annual crop costs is done on a straight-line basis for the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years. The Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs. Amortization of vineyard development costs are included in capitalized crop costs that in turn are included in inventory costs and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold.
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance against those assets, if available evidence suggests that some of those assets will not be realized.
The effect of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in the financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions would withstand an examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As facts and circumstances change, management reassesses these probabilities and would record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.
Overview
The Company generates revenue from the sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers. The Company is experiencing increased levels of competition in traditional wholesale to retail grocery distribution from large California based wineries that are acquiring, producing and marketing Oregon branded wines. Direct to consumer sales primarily include sales through the Company’s tasting rooms and wine club. Direct to consumer sales provide a higher gross profit to the Company due to prices received being closer to retail than those prices paid by wholesalers. The Company continues to emphasize growth in direct to consumer sales through use of the Hospitality Center, opening new tasting rooms and growth in wine club membership. The Company had 8,625 wine club memberships for the year ended December 31, 2021, a net increase of 752 when compared to 2020. Additionally, the Company’s preferred stock sales since August 2015 have resulted in approximately 9,400 preferred stockholders many of which the Company believes are wine enthusiasts. When considering joint ownership, we believe these new shareholders represent approximately 14,000 potential customers of the Company. The Company also has approximately 2,200 common shareholders which we believe represent an estimated 3,300 potential customers when considering joint ownership. Additionally, the Company has made a significant investment in developing alternative wine brands, products, direct sales methods and venues.
Periodically, the Company will sell grapes or bulk wine, which primarily consists of inventory that does not meet Company standards or is in excess to production targets. However, this activity is not a significant part of the Company’s activities.
The Company sold approximately 203,817 and 180,850 cases of produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 22,967 cases, or 12.7% in the current year over the prior year. The increase in case sales was primarily the result of increased shipments to distributors and higher direct sales in 2021 when compared to 2020.
Cost of Sales includes grape costs, whether purchased or grown at Company vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and processing costs, bottling, packaging, warehousing and shipping and handling costs associated with purchased production materials. For grapes grown at Company vineyards, costs include farming expenditures and amortization of vineyard development costs.
At December 31, 2021, wine inventory included approximately 101,627 cases of bottled wine and 502,755 gallons of bulk wine in various stages of the aging process. Case wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months and generally before the release date of the next vintage. The Winery bottled approximately 206,954 cases during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Impact of COVID-19 on Operations
The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a National Public Health Emergency in the United States, and on March 8, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency to address the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon. The outbreak in Oregon and other parts of the United States, as well as the response to COVID-19 by federal, state and local governments could have a continued material adverse impact on economic and market conditions in the United States, which may negatively affect our business and operations. Although the administration of vaccines in Oregon and throughout the United States contributed to the lifting of most restrictive measures, there remains ongoing uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 variations on infection levels. The re-emergence of significant increases in infection rates could result in governments re-imposing restrictive measures that could reduce or impair economic activity. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government responses to the outbreak presents continued uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company and its performance and financial results.
We have not yet experienced significant disruptions to our supply chain network; however, any future restrictions imposed by our local or state governments may have a negative impact on our future direct to consumer sales. In response to the previous closure of, and capacity restrictions in, our tasting rooms, the Company launched curbside pick-ups, and complimentary shipping specials with minimum purchase, which were able to more than offset the expected declines in direct to consumer sales.
Additionally, the demand for the Company’s wine sold directly or through distributors to restaurants, bars, and other hospitality locations could be reduced in the near-term due to the re-imposition of orders from state and local governments restricting consumers from visiting, as well as in some cases the temporary closure of such establishments.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the pandemic, and in particular the response to the COVID-19 variants that have emerged, is continuing to evolve. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company’s customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Results of Operations
compared to 2020
Net income was $2,445,463 and $3,394,996, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $949,533, or 28.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this decrease was higher operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the previous year.
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $1,001,180 and $2,278,618, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $1,277,438, or 56.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher preferred stock dividends.
The Company had net sales revenues of $31,786,864 and $27,314,852 for the years December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $4,472,012 or 16.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from direct sales of $2,739,589 or 26.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, combined with an increase in revenue from sales to distributors of $1,732,423 or 10.3% in 2021 compared to 2020.
The Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer retail sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to distributors. During 2021, revenues from retail sales increased 26.0%, revenues from in-state sales decreased 12.7%, and revenues from out-of-state sales increased 25.0%, compared to 2020.
Direct sales included $103,471 and $103,958 of bulk wine and grape sales in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and represented approximately 41.7% and 38.6% of the Company’s total net revenue for 2021 and 2020, respectively, while the Company’s remaining revenues came from sales through distributors.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company’s revenue, excluding excise taxes, from the Winery’s operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Retail sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $13,306,156 and $10,560,913, respectively, an increase of $2,745,243, or 26.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. The increase in retail sales revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly a result of increased revenues from our brand ambassador program and increased wine club sales and sales made over the internet as well as higher tasting room sales.
Bulk Wine/miscellaneous sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $103,471 and $103,958, respectively, a decrease of $487 or, 0.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, over the prior year period.
In-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $5,824,130 and $6,671,743, respectively, a decrease of $847,163, or 12.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. Management believes this decrease is primarily due to less product being available to sell at the end of 2021.
Out-of-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $12,937,605 and $10,350,708, respectively, an increase of $2,586,897, or 25.0%. Management believes this increase is related to increased sales and promotion efforts in 2021.
The Company pays alcohol excise taxes to both the OLCC and to the TTB. These taxes are based on product sales volumes. The Company is liable for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s warehouse on a per gallon basis. The Company also pays taxes on the grape harvest on a per ton basis to the OLCC for the Oregon Wine Board. The Company’s excise related taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $384,498 and $372,470, an increase of $12,028, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. This increase was due primarily to increased wine sales revenues in 2021 and the timing of removals.
Cost of Sales was $13,121,191 and $10,585,076 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $2,536,115, or 24.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, over the prior year period. This change was primarily the result of an increase in sales in 2021.
Gross profit was $18,665,673 and $16,729,776 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $1,935,897, or 11.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. This increase was generally driven by an increase in sales revenues partially offset by a higher cost of sales.
The gross margin percentage was 58.7% and 61.2% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. This decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily the result of an overall decrease in per case margins mostly due to the release of wines in 2021 from vintages produced from higher product costs such as the 2020 vintage.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $14,975,654 and $11,728,003 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $3,247,651, or 27.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. This increase was mainly the result of increased selling expenses with tasting rooms being open for more days in 2021 and shipping, packaging and administrative cost increases associated with efforts to increase sales and accommodate and develop retail growth and new operations.
Income from operations was $3,690,019 and $5,001,773 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $1,311,754, or 26.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase was higher cost of sales and higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.
Interest income was $12,412 and $21,022 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $8,610. Interest expense was $391,272 and $414,061 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $22,789, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to the decrease in loan balances in 2021 compared to the previous year.
Other income, net, was $155,183 and $165,916 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $10,733, or 6.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period.
Provision for income taxes was $1,020,879 and $1,379,654 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $358,775, or 26.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. This decrease in income taxes in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of lower income from operations in 2021.
Income per common share after preferred dividends was $0.20 and $0.46 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $0.26, or 56.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this decrease is a decrease in net income in 2021 compared to 2020.
The Company had cash balances of $13,747,285 at December 31, 2021, and $13,999,755 at December 31, 2020. The Company had no outstanding line of credit balances at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
EBITDA
In 2021, the Company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) decreased 16.9% to $5,797,295 from $6,980,083 in 2020, primarily as a result of a decrease in net income.
EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income, including financing costs. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as “GAAP”, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations as a measure of performance, nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We use EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of our own operating results and as a benchmark relative to our competitors. We consider it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expense are not actual cash costs, and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities.
EBITDA has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our GAAP results as reported. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. See the Statement of Cash Flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA for the periods indicated:
Sales
Wine case sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and ending inventory amounts for the year ended December 31, 2021, are shown on the following table:
Approximately 52% of the Company’s case sales during 2021 were of the Company’s flagship varietal, Pinot Noir. Case sales of Pinot Gris and Riesling follow with approximately 16% and 11% of case sales each, respectively. The Company sold approximately 203,817 and 180,850 cases of Company-produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This represents an increase of approximately 22,967 cases, or 12.7% in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase in case sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of increased shipments through the wine club, internet and telephone sales as well as distributors.
The Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to distributors. These three sales channels represent 41.7%, 18.1% and 40.2%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. This compares to 38.6%, 24.0% and 37.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Miscellaneous and grape sales are included in direct-to-consumer sales.
The Company’s direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors offer comparable products to customers and utilize similar processes and share resources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-to-consumer sales generate a higher gross profit margin than national sales to distributors due to differentiated pricing between these segments.
Wine Inventory
The Company had approximately 101,627 cases of bottled wine on-hand at the end of 2021. Management believes sufficient bulk wine inventory is on-hand to bottle approximately 211,419 cases of wine in 2022 and that sufficient stock is on hand to meet current demand levels until the 2021 vintage becomes available.
Production Capacity
Current production volumes are within the current production capacity constraints of the Winery when including storage capacity at the Tualatin Winery and utilization of temporary storage when appropriate. In 2021, approximately 206,954 cases were produced. The Winery has capacity to store and process about 258,620 cases of wine per year at the Estate Winery but can expand that capacity by utilizing storage at the Tualatin Winery as well as temporary storage. Management continues to invest in new production technologies intended to increase the efficiency and quality of wine production. During 2021, the Company did not choose to utilize the wine production facilities at the Tualatin Winery but did utilize it for wine storage. The Tualatin Winery has capacity to produce approximately 28,000 cases of wine. The facility is maintained in good condition. Management intends to fully utilize the production capacity at the Estate Winery before expanding into the Tualatin Winery.
Grape Supply
For the 2021 and 2020 vintages, the Company grew approximately 50% and 41% of all grapes harvested, respectively. The remaining grapes harvested were purchased from other growers. In 2021 and 2020, 30% and 50% of grapes harvested were purchased under short-term contracts, and 19% and 9% of grapes harvested were purchased under long-term contracts, respectively. The Company considers short-term contracts to be for single vintage years and long-term contracts to cover multiple vintage years.
Grapes are typically harvested and received in September and October of the vintage year. Upon receipt, the grapes are weighed, and a quality analysis is performed to ensure the grapes meet the standards set forth in the purchase contract. Based on the quantity of qualifying grapes received, the full amount payable to the grower is recorded to the grapes payable liability account. Approximately 50% of the grapes payable amount is due in November of the vintage year. The remaining amount is due in March of the following year. The grapes are processed into wine, which is typically bottled and available for sale between five months and two years from date of harvest.
The Company received $1,166,116 and $220,650 worth of grapes from long-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company received $1,762,283 and $3,339,460 worth of grapes from short-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total grapes payable was $1,388,601 and $1,307,165 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Grapes payable includes $538,677 and $126,024 of grapes payable from long-term contracts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company plans to address long-term grape supply needs by developing new vineyards on properties currently owned or secured by lease. The Company has approximately 46 acres of vineyards that have been planted but are in the pre-productive stage. We anticipate that these vineyards will begin producing grapes within the next one to three years. The Company has approximately 251 acres of land that is suitable for future vineyard development. Management currently has plans to plant approximately 42 acres in 2022, which we anticipate will begin producing grapes in 2026. Additionally, the Company intends to seek out opportunities to acquire land for future grape plantings in order to continue to increase available quantities, maintain control over farming practices, more effectively manage grape costs and mitigate uncertainty associated with long-term contracts.

Seasonality
The Company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenue and net income. Typically, first quarter sales are the lowest of any given year, and sales volumes increase progressively through the fourth quarter mostly because of consumer buying habits.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital balance of $24.5 million and a current ratio of 3.05:1. The Company had cash balances of $13,747,285, at December 31, 2021.
Total cash provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,572,708, which resulted primarily from cash provided by net income combined with increased non-cash operating expenses, such as depreciation and unearned revenue, being partially offset by cash used in connection with increased inventory and accounts receivable.
Total cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10,301,395, which primarily consisted of cash used on construction activity and vineyard development costs.
Total cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $7,476,217, which primarily consisted of proceeds from investor deposits related to the Preferred Stock offering as well as the issuance of Preferred Stock, being partially offset by the repayment of debt and payment of a preferred stock dividend.
In 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the construction of a new tasting room at the Bernau Estate Vineyard, expected to be completed during the 2022 fiscal year. The total construction costs for the Bernau Estate Tasting Room is expected to be approximately $15.6 million, which will be funded through a combination of cash on hand as well as equity financing through Preferred Stock offerings. Construction began in July 2019 and was paused in March 2020 as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and has now been restarted. As of December 31, 2021, we had incurred approximately $9.5 million in costs related to the project.
In December of 2005, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Umpqua Bank that allows borrowing up to $2,000,000 against eligible accounts receivable and inventories, as defined in the agreement. The revolving line bears interest at prime less 0.5%, with a floor of 3.25%, is payable monthly, and is subject to renewal. In July 2021, the Company renewed the credit agreement until July 31, 2023. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance on this revolving line of credit and the Company was in compliance with the line of credit’s financial covenants.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total long-term debt balance of $5,535,096, including the portion due in the next year, owed to Farm Credit Services, exclusive of debt issuance costs of $132,483. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a total long-term debt balance of $5,985,228, exclusive of debt issuance costs of $145,731. The debt with NW Farm Credit Services was used to finance the Hospitality Center and subsequent remodels, invest in winery equipment to increase the Company’s winemaking capacity, complete the storage facility, and acquire new vineyard land for future development.
