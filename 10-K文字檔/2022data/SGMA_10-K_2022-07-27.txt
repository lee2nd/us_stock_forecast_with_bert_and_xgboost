(“SigmaTron”), its wholly-owned subsidiaries Standard Components de Mexico S.A., AbleMex, S.A. de C.V., Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd., Spitfire Controls (Cayman) Co. Ltd., Wagz, Inc., wholly-owned foreign enterprises Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. and international procurement office SigmaTron Taiwan branch (collectively, the “Company”) and other Items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements concerning the Company’s business or results of operations. Words such as “continue,” “anticipate,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “plan,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the Company. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company’s plans, actions and actual results could differ materially. Such statements should be evaluated in the context of the direct and indirect risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s business including, but not necessarily limited to, the risks inherent in any merger, acquisition or business combination (including the December 2021 acquisition of Wagz,Inc.); the Company’s continued dependence on certain significant customers; the continued market acceptance of products and services offered by the Company and its customers; pricing pressures from the Company’s customers, suppliers and the market; the activities of competitors, some of which may have greater financial or other resources than the Company; the variability of the Company’s operating results; the results of long-lived assets impairment testing; the ability to achieve the expected benefits of acquisitions as well as the expenses of acquisitions; the collection of aged account receivables; the variability of the Company’s customers’ requirements; the impact of inflation on the Company’s operating results; the availability and cost of necessary components and materials; the impact acts of war may have to the supply chain; the ability of the Company and its customers to keep current with technological changes within its industries; regulatory compliance, including conflict minerals; the continued availability and sufficiency of the Company’s credit arrangements; the costs of borrowing under the Company’s senior and subordinated credit facilities, including under the rate indices that replaced LIBOR; the ability to meet the Company’s financial and restrictive covenants under its loan agreements; changes in U.S., Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese or Taiwanese regulations affecting the Company’s business; the turmoil in the global economy and financial markets; the spread of COVID-19 and variants (commonly known as “COVID-19”) which has threatened the Company’s financial stability by causing a disruption to the Company’s global supply chain, caused plant closings or reduced operations thus reducing output at those facilities; the continued availability of scarce raw materials, exacerbated by global supply chain disruptions, necessary for the manufacture of products by the Company; the stability of the U.S., Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese and Taiwanese economic, labor and political systems and conditions; global business disruption caused by the Russia invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions; currency exchange fluctuations; and the ability of the Company to manage its growth. These and other factors which may affect the Company’s future business and results of operations are identified throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as risk factors, may be detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements speak as of the date of such filings, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update such statements in light of future events or otherwise unless otherwise required by law.
Overview
The Company operates in two reportable segments as an independent provider of EMS, and as a provider of products to the Pet Tech market. The EMS segment includes printed circuit board assemblies, electro-mechanical subassemblies and completely assembled (box-build) electronic products. The Pet Tech reportable segment offers electronic products such as the Freedom Smart Dog Collar, a wireless, geo-mapped fence, and wellness system, and apparel and accessories.
The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company’s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer’s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers. The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers. The Company believes that short-term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility, given that the Company’s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers.
In connection with the production of assembled products, the Company provides services to its customers, including (1) automatic and manual assembly and testing of products; (2) material sourcing and procurement; (3) manufacturing and test engineering support; (4) design services; (5) warehousing and distribution services; (6) assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies and (7) compliance reporting. The Company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the United States, Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan.
The Company began its Pet Technology operations after the December 2021 acquisition of Wagz, Inc., discussed below under “Recent Developments”.
Sales can be a misleading indicator of the Company’s financial performance. Sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services (turnkey versus consignment) rendered by the Company and the demand by customers. Consignment orders require the Company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer, and the Company charges only for its labor, overhead and manufacturing costs, plus a profit. In the case of turnkey orders, the Company provides, in addition to manufacturing services, the components and other materials used in assembly. Turnkey contracts, in general, have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly, owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold. Variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the Company’s revenue and gross margin levels. Consignment orders accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for each of the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021.
The Company’s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the Company to manufacture in China, Mexico, Vietnam or the U.S. We believe this strategy will continue to serve the Company well as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies.
Factors Affecting Results
Supply Chain Component Shortages and COVID-19. The Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. The impact of COVID continued in fiscal 2022 and is expected to continue to impact the Company in future periods. The Company has experienced some plant closures in fiscal 2022 and has experienced significant supply chain issues due to world-wide component shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic and both public and private measures taken to contain it have negatively affected the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, all of which may continue to worsen.
For more information on the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our financial condition and results of operations have been impacted and may in the future be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.”
PPP Loan and CARES Act. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 the Company received a $6,282,973 PPP Loan. The Company received the PPP Loan under the CARES Act. The Company believes it met the requirements for eligibility. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 and continuing in fiscal year 2022, the Company had operational interruptions and incurred significant expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic at all of its operations. In some locations the interruptions and expenses were worse than others.
The Company was notified of the forgiveness of the PPP Loan by the SBA on July 9, 2021 and all principal and accrued interest were forgiven. The accounting for the forgiveness is reflected in the Company’s Statement of Operations of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules as a non-cash gain upon extinguishment of long-term debt.
Recent Developments
On December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Wagz under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 19, 2021, as amended by the First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 7, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”). Wagz has developed and brought to market a high tech pet collar and has multiple other products in development. Wagz is an IoT company which both owns intellectual property and secures recurring revenue through subscriptions for its services.
Prior to the acquisition, the Company had an investment in Wagz of $600,000, Convertible Secured Promissory Notes issued by Wagz of $12,000,000 and Secured Promissory Notes issued by Wagz of $1,380,705. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, prior to the acquisition, the Convertible Secured Promissory Notes converted to 12,000,000 shares of Wagz common stock, resulting in a 25.5% ownership in Wagz. As described in Note F - Acquisition of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, the Company’s 25.5% equity interest in Wagz common stock was remeasured to fair value of $6,299,765, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $6,300,235.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, 2,443,870 shares of common stock of the Company were issued in the merger for a value of $25,245,177, of which 1,546,592 shares are allocated to Wagz shareholders (excluding the Company) for a total value of $15,976,295, and 897,278 shares are allocated to the Company and treated as treasury stock for a total value of $9,268,881 and were recorded in the Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity under Issuance of stock for acquisition, respectively. The treasury shares were retired as of April 30, 2022.
On July 18, 2022, SigmaTron, Wagz and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Lender”) amended the Credit Agreement dated as of January 29, 2021, by entering into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Facility” or “Credit Agreement”). The Facility, as amended, allows the Company to borrow on a revolving basis up to the lesser of (i) $70,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base minus any reserves established by Lender. The Facility bears interest at the adjusted REVSOFR30 rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate per annum applicable to the Facility will be the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (“SOFR”), plus the Applicable Margin of 2.0%. The maturity date of the Facility was extended to July 18, 2027.
In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, Lender and The Private Credit Group of TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”) under the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), entered into the Intercreditor Agreement, dated July 18, 2022, and acknowledged by SigmaTron and Wagz (the “ICA”), to set forth and govern the lenders’ respective lien priorities, rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement.
The Facility is secured by: (a) a first priority security interest in SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s: (i) accounts and inventory (excluding Term Priority Mexican Inventory (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (“ICA”)) and certain inventory in transit, (ii) deposit accounts, (iii) proceeds of business interruption insurance that constitute ABL BI Insurance Share (as defined in the ICA), (iv) certain other property, including payment intangibles, instruments, equipment, software and hardware and similar systems, books and records, to the extent related to the foregoing, and (v) all proceeds of the foregoing, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the “ABL Priority Collateral”); and (b) a second priority security interest in Term Priority Collateral (as defined below) other than (i) real estate and (ii) unless Lender requests a pledge thereof following July 18, 2022, the equity interests of SigmaTron’s foreign subsidiaries.
On July 18, 2022, SigmaTron, Wagz and The Private Credit Group of TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), and other Lenders party thereto (collectively, “TCW”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) pursuant to which TCW made a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $40,000,000 (the “TCW Term Loan”). The TCW Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum applicable to the Term Loan Facility based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (“SOFR”), plus the Applicable Margin of 7.50% (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement). The Term Loan will have a SOFR floor of 1.00%. The maturity date of the TCW Term Loan is July 18, 2027.
The TCW Term Loan is secured by: (a) a first priority security interest in all property of SigmaTron and Wagz that does not constitute ABL Priority Collateral, which includes: (i) SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s real estate other than SigmaTron’s Del Rio, Texas, warehouses, (ii) SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s machinery, equipment and fixtures (but excluding ABL Priority Equipment (as defined in the ICA)), (iii) the Term Priority Mexican Inventory (as defined in the ICA), (iv) SigmaTron’s stock in its direct and indirect subsidiaries, (v) SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s general intangibles (excluding any that constitute ABL Priority Collateral), goodwill and intellectual property, (vi) the proceeds of business interruption insurance that constitute Term BI Insurance Share (as defined in the ICA), (vii) tax refunds, and (viii) all proceeds thereof, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the “Term Priority Collateral”); and (b) a second priority security interest in all collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral. Also, SigmaTron’s three Mexican subsidiaries pledged all of their assets as security for the TCW Term loan.
Critical Accounting Policies:
Management Estimates and Uncertainties - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods, the allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete reserves for inventory, deferred income, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions, valuation allowance for deferred taxes and valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
The potential impact of future disruptions and continued economic uncertainty over COVID-19, including variants, and the global supply chain may have a significant adverse impact on the timing of delivery of customer orders and the levels of future customer orders. It is possible that these potential adverse impacts may result in the recognition of material impairments of the Company’s long-lived assets or other related charges in future periods.
Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s primary performance obligation to its customers is the production of finished goods electronic assembly products pursuant to purchase orders. The Company has concluded that control of the products it sells and transfers to its customers and an enforceable right to receive payment is customarily established at the point in time when the finished goods are shipped to its customers, or in some cases delivered pursuant to the specified shipping terms of each customer arrangement. With respect to consignment arrangements, control transfers and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the goods are shipped to the customer from the consignment location or when delivered to the customer (pursuant to agreed upon shipping terms). In those limited instances where finished goods delivered to the customer location are stored in a segregated area which are not controlled by the customer (title transfer, etc.) until they are pulled from the segregated area and consumed by the Company’s customer, revenue is recognized upon consumption. For tooling services, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when the customer takes possession of dies or molds. For engineering, design, and testing services, the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as the respective services are rendered as its customers simultaneously derive value from the Company’s performance. From the time that a customer purchase order is received and contract is established, the Company’s performance obligations are typically
fulfilled within a few weeks. The Company does not have any performance obligations that require more than one year to fulfill.
Each customer purchase order sets forth the transaction price for the products and services purchased under that arrangement. The Company evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers and exercises judgment to recognize revenue based upon the amount the Company expects to be paid for each sales transaction it enters into with its customers. Some customer arrangements include variable consideration, such as volume rebates, some of which depend upon the Company’s customers meeting specified performance criteria, such as a purchasing level over a period of time. The Company exercises judgment to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration at each reporting date.
Inventories - Inventories are valued at cost. Cost is determined by an average cost method and the Company allocates labor and overhead to work-in-process and finished goods. In the event of an inventory write-down, the Company records expense to state the inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company establishes inventory reserves for valuation, shrinkage, and excess and obsolete inventory. The Company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Of the Company’s raw materials inventory, a substantial portion has been purchased to fulfill committed future orders or for which the Company is contractually entitled to recover its costs from its customers. For the remaining raw materials inventory, a provision for excess and obsolete inventories is recorded for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions. Upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory, the corresponding reserve is relieved to ensure the cost basis of the inventory reflects any reductions. Actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the Company’s inventories and cost of products sold as the inventory is sold or otherwise relieved.
Intangible Assets - Intangible assets are comprised of finite life intangible assets including customer relationships, trade names and patents. The fair value recorded as of April 30, 2022 is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the acquired trade names and patents was determined using the relief from royalty method, which is a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow approach. The relief from royalty method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. The relief from royalty method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by the intangible asset, multiplying it by a royalty rate deemed to be avoided through ownership of the asset and discounting the projected royalty savings amounts back to the acquisition date using the internal rate of return.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - The Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment. Property, machinery and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, the Company first performs an impairment review based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of its assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment, if any, for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group and its carrying value. The Company further conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment. The Company’s analysis for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 did not indicate that any of its other long-lived assets were impaired.
Impairment of Goodwill - Goodwill represents the cost of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Income Tax - The Company’s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates by management are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense assessment.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company begins with historical results and changes in accounting policies, and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment and estimates by management about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, the Company considers three years of cumulative operating income and/or loss. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount more likely than not to be realized. SigmaTron and Wagz will file U.S. tax returns on a consolidated basis for periods ending after the merger. Therefore, a valuation allowance was established on the group’s U.S. deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2022. The Company has established a valuation allowance of $4,146,208 on its federal and state NOL carryforwards and other U.S. deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2022.

Results of Operations:
FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2022 COMPARED
TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2021
The following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to net sales for the years indicated:
Net sales
Net sales increased $101,147,752, or 36.4%, to $378,866,424 in fiscal 2022, compared to $277,718,672 in fiscal 2021. The Company’s sales increased in fiscal year 2022 in consumer electronics, industrial electronics and medical/life science compared to the prior year. The overall increase in net sales was primarily due to increasing demand from existing and new customers. In addition, net sales were higher in fiscal 2022, due to certain customer price increases implemented as a result of increased raw material and other operating costs that occurred during the fiscal year.
Costs of products sold
Cost of products sold increased $81,668,078, or 32.3%, to $334,434,553 (88.3% of net sales) in fiscal 2022, compared to $252,766,475 (91.0% of net sales) in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher material, logistics and other operating costs as a result of higher sales volumes and the impact of global supply chain disruptions that caused factory inefficiencies. Labor costs and other manufacturing costs were higher in fiscal 2022 as fiscal 2021, due to inflationary pressures
Gross profit margin
Gross profit margin was 11.7% of net sales, in fiscal year 2022 compared to 9.0% of net sales in fiscal 2021. The increase was due to higher customer price increases, partially offset with higher material, logistics and other operating costs associated with global supply chain disruptions that caused factory inefficiencies.‌
Selling and administrative expenses
Selling and administrative expenses increased $7,339,658, or 34.0% to $28,902,071 (7.6% of net sales) in fiscal 2022, compared to $21,562,413 (7.8% of net sales) in fiscal 2021. Of the $7,339,658 increase, $2,861,211 relates to the Wagz business, acquired on December 31, 2021 and therefore were not included in fiscal 2021 operations. In addition, selling and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2022 due to transaction expenses for the Wagz acquisition, higher Company performance bonus expense and higher costs due to inflationary pressures.
Impairment of notes receivable and investment
Prior to the acquisition, the Company had an investment in Wagz of $600,000, Convertible Secured Promissory Notes issued by Wagz of $12,000,000 and Secured Promissory Notes issued by Wagz of $1,380,705. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, prior to the acquisition, the Convertible Secured Promissory Notes converted to 12,000,000 shares of Wagz common stock, resulting in a 25.5% ownership in Wagz. As described in Note F - Acquisition of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, the Company’s 25.5% equity interest in Wagz common stock was remeasured to fair value of $6,299,765, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $6,300,235.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net, increased slightly to $1,500,294 in fiscal 2022 compared to $1,291,024 in fiscal year 2021. The increase relates to higher average borrowings, as well as increased interest rates in fiscal 2022.
Income tax expense

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
Operating Activities
Cash flow used in operating activities was $20,227,399 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $8,098,946 for the prior fiscal year. Cash flow used in operating activities was primarily the result of an increase in both inventory and accounts receivable in the amount of $68,314,626 and $12,188,024, respectively. Cash flow from operating activities was offset by an increase in accounts payable and deferred revenue in the amount of $32,824,474 and $10,487,828, respectively. The increase in inventory is the result of an increase in inventory purchases to satisfy customer orders. Further, capacity issues in the component industry made it difficult to obtain some components to complete assemblies for shipping. The increase in accounts payable is the result of more favorable payment terms with vendors and increased inventory purchases.

Notes Payable - Banks
Prior to January 29, 2021, the Company had a senior secured credit facility with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”). The revolving credit facility allowed the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (i) $45,000,000 (the “Revolving Line Cap”) less reserves or (ii) the Borrowing Base, but no more than 80% of the Company’s Revolving Line Cap. Prior to its payoff and termination, the U.S. Bank senior secured credit
facility was due to expire on March 31, 2022. On January 29, 2021, the Company paid the balance outstanding under the senior secured credit facility in the amount of $25,574,733. The unamortized deferred financing costs of $158,476 were expensed in fiscal year 2021 upon extinguishment of the debt.
On January 29, 2021, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Lender”), pursuant to which Lender has agreed to provide the Company with a secured credit facility maturing on January 29,2026, of which (a) up to $50,000,000 is available on a revolving loan basis, and (b) an aggregate of $6,500,000 was borrowed pursuant to two term loans (the “Facility”). The Facility is secured by substantially all of SigmaTron’ assets including mortgages on its two Illinois properties.
The Facility allows the Company to choose among interest rates at which it may borrow funds for revolving loans: “CBFR Loans,” the interest on which is based on (A) the “REVLIBOR30 Rate” (as defined in the Agreement) unless the REVLIBOR30 Rate is not available, in which case the interest is generally the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the U.S., plus (B) an applicable margin of 2.0% (effectively 2.41% per annum at April 30, 2022); or “Eurodollar Loans,” the interest on which is based on (X) an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Agreement) for any interest period multiplied by the Standard Reserve Rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus (Y) an applicable margin of 2.0%. Under the revolving portion of the Facility, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of (i) $50,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base. The Facility is collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company. Under the Agreement, a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (“FCCR”) financial covenant of 1.10x is applicable only during an FCCR trigger period which occurs when (i) an event of default (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, and Lender has elected to impose a FCCR trigger period upon notice to the Company or (ii) availability falls below the greater of (a) 10% of the revolving commitment and (b) the outstanding principal amount of the term loans. The Company was not in a FCCR trigger period as of April 30, 2022.
