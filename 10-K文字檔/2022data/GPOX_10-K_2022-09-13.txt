We will require additional funds for our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses.
Specifically, based on nominal operations we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows:
We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately $1,692,000 over the next 12 months to pay for our planned expenses. In addition, our planned expenses, including legal, accounting and audit fees, and general and administrative expenses, may be higher in the event we enter into any significant transactions. These planned cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Although our cash requirements may be offset in part by anticipated revenues, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations, execute our business plan, and repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities.
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our future operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. If we are not successful in raising sufficient capital to execute our business plan, we will be required to scale down or delay our plan of operation to accommodate our available resources.
Contractual Obligations
Not required for smaller reporting companies
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

Convertible Financial Instruments
The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP.
When the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all such compensation to employees and non-employees to be calculated based on its fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date and recognized in the earnings over the requisite service or vesting period.
