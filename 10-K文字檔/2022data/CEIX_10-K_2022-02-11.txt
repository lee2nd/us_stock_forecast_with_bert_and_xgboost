ITEM 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
COVID-19 Update
The Company is monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) and has taken, and will continue to take, steps to mitigate the potential risks and impact on the Company and its employees. The health and safety of our employees is paramount. To date, the Company has experienced a few localized outbreaks, but due, in part, to the health and safety procedures put in place by the Company, we have been able to continue operating. The Company continues to monitor the health and safety of its employees closely in order to limit potential risks to our employees, contractors, family members and the community.
Additionally, COVID-19 led to an unprecedented decline in coal demand that began in the first quarter of 2020 and hit its lowest point in May 2020, largely driven by government-imposed shutdowns of non-essential businesses. We are considered a critical infrastructure company by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As a result, we were exempt from Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's executive order, issued in March 2020, closing all businesses that are not life sustaining until Pennsylvania's phased reopening, which began in the second quarter of 2020. While many government-imposed shutdowns of non-essential businesses in the United States and abroad have been phased out, there is a possibility that such shut-downs may be reinstated. Depressed demand for our coal may also result from a general recession or reduction in overall business activity caused by COVID-19.
Over the past year, the general business environment has improved, resulting in higher demand for our product as government-imposed shutdowns and other COVID-19-related restrictions have been eased. However, imbalances in the global supply chain coupled with inflationary pressures have had both positive and negative impacts to our operations. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including Presidential mandates, federal and state regulations, new information concerning the severity of COVID-19 variants, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects. We expect this could continue to impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company will continue to take steps it believes are appropriate to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on its operations, liquidity and financial condition.
2021 Highlights:
• Coal shipments of 23.7 million tons, of which a record 11.0 million tons went into the export market and 37% of the total sales were used in non-power generations applications.
•
Payments on total consolidated indebtedness of $101.2 million - reduced Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Second Lien Notes (each as defined below), and equipment-financed debt outstanding by $25.0 million, $30.9 million, $17.1 million and $28.2 million, respectively.
Outlook for 2022:
•
We expect that the PAMC will sell approximately 23 million to 25 million tons in 2022.
•
We expect PAMC average revenue per ton sold to be $55.00-$57.00 and PAMC average cash cost of coal sold per ton, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be $29.00-$31.00.
•
We are planning to make capital expenditures during 2022 as follows: $110 to $125 million associated with PAMC maintenance, $42 to $47 million in connection with the remaining development of the Itmann Mine, and $10 to $23 million associated with other expenditures (including ESG initiatives).
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Our management team uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability. The metrics include: (i) coal production, sales volumes and average revenue per ton; (ii) cost of coal sold, a non-GAAP financial measure; (iii) cash cost of coal sold, a non-GAAP financial measure; (iv) average cash cost of coal sold per ton, a non-GAAP financial measure; (v) average margin per ton sold, an operating ratio derived from non-GAAP financial measures; (vi) average cash margin per ton sold, an operating ratio derived from non-GAAP financial measures; and (vii) adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.
Cost of coal sold, cash cost of coal sold, average cash cost of coal sold per ton, average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold normalize the volatility contained within comparable GAAP measures by adjusting certain non-operating or non-cash transactions. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides a helpful measure of comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing, capital structures and tax rates than ours. Each of these non-GAAP metrics are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:
•
our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;
•
the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow;
•
our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;
•
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities; and
•
the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to total costs, total coal revenue, net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and these measures and the way we calculate them may vary from those of other companies. As a result, the items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We evaluate our cost of coal sold and cash cost of coal sold on an aggregate basis. We define cost of coal sold as operating and other production costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in coal inventory, both in volumes and carrying values. The cost of coal sold includes items such as direct operating costs, royalty and production taxes, direct administration costs, and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs on production assets. Cost of coal sold excludes any indirect costs, such as selling, general and administrative costs, freight expenses, interest expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization costs on non-production assets and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal. The cash cost of coal sold includes cost of coal sold less depreciation, depletion and amortization costs on production assets. We define average cash cost of coal sold per ton as cash cost of coal sold divided by tons sold. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cost of coal sold, cash cost of coal sold and average cash cost of coal sold per ton is total costs and expenses.
The following table presents a reconciliation of cost of coal sold, cash cost of coal sold and average cash cost of coal sold per ton to total costs and expenses, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except per ton information).
We evaluate our average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold on a per-ton basis. We define average margin per ton sold as average revenue per ton sold, net of average cost of coal sold per ton. We define average cash margin per ton sold as average revenue per ton sold, net of average cash cost of coal sold per ton. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold is total coal revenue.
The following table presents a reconciliation of average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold to total coal revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except per ton information).
We define adjusted EBITDA as (i) net income (loss) plus income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization, as adjusted for (ii) certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation and unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss).
Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. Shareholders
CONSOL Energy reported net income attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. stockholders of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net loss attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. stockholders of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
CONSOL Energy's business consists of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex and the CONSOL Marine Terminal segments, as well as various corporate and other business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal segments. The other business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves and Resources, closed mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
PAMC ANALYSIS:
The PAMC division's principal activities consist of mining, preparation and marketing of bituminous coal, sold primarily to power generators, industrial end-users and metallurgical end-users. The division also includes selling, general and administrative costs, as well as various other activities assigned to the PAMC division, but not included in the cost components on a per unit basis.
The PAMC division had earnings before income tax of $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to earnings before income tax of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in the 2021 earnings was an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments of $52 million (see Note 21 - Derivatives in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). Variances are discussed below.
Coal Production
The table below presents total tons produced (in thousands) from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the periods indicated:
Coal production was 23.9 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 18.8 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2020.The PAMC’s coal production increased primarily due to improved demand for the Company’s coal after reaching a low point in the second quarter of 2020 due to negative impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Coal Operations
The PAMC division's coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for these periods were as follows:
(1) Average cash cost of coal sold per ton and average cost of coal sold per ton are non-GAAP measures, and average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold are operating ratios derived from non-GAAP measures. See “How We Evaluate Our Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Coal Revenue
Coal revenue was $1,085 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $771 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. After a steep decline following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, demand for the Company's coal has improved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of improved global coal demand, continued tightness of coal supply and higher natural gas and electric power prices, the Company realized higher pricing on both its export contracts and contracts that contain positive electric power-price adjustments, as well as an increase in the volume of coal sold in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Freight Revenue and Freight Expense
Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on the weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation, primarily rail, used by the customers to which the Company contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is completely offset by freight expense. Freight revenue and freight expense were both $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $64 million increase was due to increased shipments to customers where the Company was contractually obligated to provide transportation services.
Unrealized Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments
The Company periodically sells or purchases forward contracts, swaps and options in the over-the-counter coal market in order to manage its exposure to coal prices. The increases in API2 coal prices resulted in unrealized mark-to-market losses of $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to these commodity derivative contracts. The Company did not experience similar unrealized gains or losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company did not previously enter into hedging arrangements to manage its exposure to coal prices.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $62 million decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of certain mining rights and additional customer contract buyouts in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. These partial contract buyouts involved negotiations to reduce coal quantities of several customer contracts in exchange for payment of certain fees to the Company, and do not impact forward contract terms.
Cost of Coal Sold
Cost of coal sold is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in both the volumes and carrying values of coal inventory. The costs of coal sold include items such as direct operating costs, royalties and production taxes, direct administration costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs on production assets. Total cost of coal sold was $864 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or $150 million higher than the $714 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the total cost of coal sold was primarily driven by increased production activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly in response to greater market demand. Average cost of coal sold per ton was $36.43 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $38.24 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average cost of coal sold per ton is reflective of higher productivity levels and effective cost control measures.
Other Costs
Other costs include items that are assigned to the PAMC division but are not included in unit costs, such as idle mine costs, coal reserve holding costs and purchased coal costs. Total other costs decreased $47 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily attributable to the temporary idling of longwalls at the Bailey and Enlow Fork mines due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered the widespread government-imposed shutdowns that significantly reduced electricity consumption and industrial activity and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal in that year.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
The amount of selling, general and administrative costs related to the PAMC division was $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $19 million increase was primarily related to increased expense under the long-term and short-term incentive compensation plans for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was payable to the Company's employees as a result of achieving certain financial metrics and a substantial increase in the Company's share price compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
CONSOL MARINE TERMINAL ANALYSIS:
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division provides coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. The division also includes selling, general and administrative activities and interest expense, as well as various other activities assigned to the CONSOL Marine Terminal division.
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division had earnings before income tax of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to earnings before income tax of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Throughput tons for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 13.8 million tons, compared to 10.1 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the COVID-related demand decline that impacted part of 2020. However, terminal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 included revenues from a take-or-pay contract for volumes in excess of actual throughput tons. This contract expired on December 31, 2020 and was not renewed.
OTHER ANALYSIS:
The other division includes revenue and expenses from various corporate and diversified business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal divisions. The diversified business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves and Resources, closed mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
Other business activities had a loss before income tax of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss before income tax of $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Variances are discussed below.
Coal Revenue
Coal revenue consists of the sale of coal mined during the development of the Itmann Mine located in Wyoming County, West Virginia. The increase is due to the increased volume of coal mined during the ongoing development of the mine.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change is due to the following items:
Royalty income - non-operated coal decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to a decline in operating activity by third-party companies mining in reserves to which we have a royalty claim, which reduced our royalty revenues.
The decrease in income resulting from the sale of certain coal lease contracts is attributable to one of several transactions completed in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Company's non-operating surface and mineral assets outside of the PAMC. These transactions helped to enhance the Company's liquidity and improve its financial flexibility in the year ended December 31, 2020, but did not reoccur during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 2 - Major Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Litigation proceeds in the amount of $9 million were received during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of positive developments in legal matters in which the Company was the plaintiff but did not reoccur during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gain on Sale of Assets
Gain on sale of assets decreased $4 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of the number of gas wells sold in 2021 compared to 2020.
Operating and Other Costs
Operating and other costs were $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Operating and other costs decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to the following items:
Employee-Related Legacy Liability Expense decreased $17 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions made at the beginning of each year. See Note 15 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans and Note 16 - Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis and Workers' Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Operating Cost of Coal Sold - Itmann is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in both the volumes and carrying values of coal inventory. The costs of coal sold include items such as direct operating costs, royalties and production taxes and direct administration costs. The increase is due to the increased volume of coal mined during the ongoing development of the mine.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $5 million in the period-to-period comparison due to adjustments to the Company's asset retirement obligations based on current projected cash outflows.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Selling, general and administrative costs are allocated to the Company's Other division based on a percentage of resources utilized, a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures. The decrease of $4 million is primarily a result of fees incurred in connection with the CCR Merger for the year ended December 2020. This was offset, in part, by increased expense under the long-term and short-term incentive compensation plans for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was payable to the Company's employees as a result of achieving certain financial metrics and a substantial increase in the Company's share price compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gain on Debt Extinguishment
Gain on debt extinguishment of $1 million and $21 million was recognized in the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, due to the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, which traded substantially below par value in 2020 but experienced a significant recovery in prices in 2021.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, remained materially consistent in the period-to-period comparison.
Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net (Loss) Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. Shareholders
CONSOL Energy reported net loss attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. stockholders of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. stockholders of $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
CONSOL Energy's business consists of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex and the CONSOL Marine Terminal segments, as well as various corporate and other business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal segments. The other business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves and Resources, closed mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
PAMC ANALYSIS:
The PAMC division's principal activities consist of mining, preparation and marketing of bituminous coal, sold primarily to power generators, industrial end-users and metallurgical end-users. The division also includes selling, general and administrative costs, as well as various other activities assigned to the PAMC division, but not included in the cost components on a per unit basis.
The PAMC division had earnings before income tax of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to earnings before income tax of $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Variances are discussed below.
Coal Production
The table below presents total tons produced (in thousands) from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the periods indicated:
Coal production was 18.8 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 27.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2019. The PAMC division's coal production decreased primarily due to the temporary idling of longwalls at the Bailey and Enlow Fork mines. This was mainly in response to weakened customer demand as a result of a warmer than normal winter, followed by global demand destruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, the widespread government-imposed shut-downs, which significantly reduced electricity consumption and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal.
Coal Operations
The PAMC division's coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for these periods were as follows:
(1) Average cash cost of coal sold per ton and average cost of coal sold per ton are non-GAAP measures and average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold are operating ratios derived from non-GAAP measures. See “How We Evaluate Our Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Coal Revenue
Coal revenue was $771 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total tons sold decreased in the period-to-period comparison in response to weakened customer demand due to a warmer than normal winter followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, each of which reduced electricity consumption and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal. Additionally, lower natural gas prices as compared to the prior year contributed to electric generation trending toward gas, rather than coal, as a fuel source. The decrease in overall demand, including in both the domestic and export markets the Company serves, resulted in lower pricing received on the Company's sales contracts.
Freight Revenue and Freight Expense
Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on the weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation, primarily rail, used by the customers to which the Company contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is completely offset by freight expense. Freight revenue and freight expense were both $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $20 million increase was due to increased shipments to customers where the Company was contractually obligated to provide transportation services.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $61 million increase was primarily the result of the sale of certain mining rights and additional customer contract buyouts in the year ended December 31, 2020, offset, in part, by a decrease in sales of externally purchased coal to blend and resell. These partial contract buyouts involved negotiations to reduce coal quantities of several customer contracts in exchange for payment of certain fees to the Company, and do not impact forward contract terms.
Cost of Coal Sold
Cost of coal sold is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in both the volumes and carrying values of coal inventory. The costs of coal sold include items such as direct operating costs, royalties and production taxes, direct administration costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs on production assets. Total cost of coal sold was $714 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or $307 million lower than the $1,021 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average cost of coal sold per ton was $38.24 for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $37.37 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the total cost of coal sold was primarily driven by decreased production activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly in response to weakened market demand, while on a per unit basis, the decreased production resulted in an overall increase in the average cost of coal sold per ton.
Other Costs
Other costs include items that are assigned to the PAMC division but are not included in unit costs, such as coal reserve holding costs and purchased coal costs. Total other costs increased $40 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the temporary idling of longwalls at the Bailey and Enlow Fork mines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, the widespread government-imposed shutdowns, which significantly reduced electricity consumption and industrial activity and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
The amount of selling, general and administrative costs related to the PAMC division was $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $10 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison was primarily related to several initiatives launched by management to reduce costs, including compensation reductions, curtailment of discretionary expenses and headcount management, partially offset by fees incurred as a result of the CCR Merger.
CONSOL MARINE TERMINAL ANALYSIS:
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division provides coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. The division also includes selling, general and administrative activities and interest expense, as well as various other activities assigned to the CONSOL Marine Terminal division.
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division had earnings before income tax of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to earnings before income tax of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Overall earnings before income tax were relatively consistent in the period-to-period comparison. The improvement in operating and other costs was the result of cost reduction initiatives implemented at the CONSOL Marine Terminal, and was also directly related to reduced throughput due to weakened export markets and global demand destruction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, the widespread government-imposed shut-downs. However, due to the take-or-pay arrangements in both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the decline in demand was mitigated. This improvement was offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative costs, which are allocated to the Company's divisions based on a percentage of resources utilized, a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures.
OTHER ANALYSIS:
The other division includes revenue and expenses from various corporate and diversified business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal divisions. The diversified business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves and Resources, closed mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
Other business activities had a loss before income tax of $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss before income tax of $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Variances are discussed below.
Coal Revenue
Coal revenue consists of the sale of coal mined during the development of the Itmann Mine located in Wyoming County, West Virginia.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is due to the following items:
The increase in income resulting from the sale of certain coal lease contracts is attributable to one of several transactions completed in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Company's non-operating surface and mineral assets outside of the PAMC. These transactions helped to enhance the Company's liquidity and improve its financial flexibility. See Note 2 - Major Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Royalty income - non-operated coal decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to a decline in operating activity by third-party companies mining in reserves to which we have a royalty claim, which reduced our royalty revenues.
Litigation proceeds in the amount of $9 million were received during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of positive developments in legal matters in which the Company is the plaintiff.
Gain on Sale of Assets
Gain on sale of assets increased $13 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to the sale of various gas wells during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating and Other Costs
Operating and other costs were $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating and other costs decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to the following items:
Employee-Related Legacy Liability Expense decreased $11 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions made at the beginning of each year. See Note 15 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans and Note 16 - Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis and Workers' Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Operating Cost of Coal Sold - Itmann is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in both the volumes and carrying values of coal inventory. The costs of coal sold include items such as direct operating costs, royalties and production taxes and direct administration costs.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $9 million in the period-to-period comparison due to adjustments to the Company's asset retirement obligations based on current projected cash outflows.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Selling, general and administrative costs are allocated to the Company's Other division based on a percentage of resources utilized, a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures. The increase of $14 million is primarily a result of fees incurred in connection with the CCR Merger and also a result of increases in the portion of selling, general and administrative expenses allocated to the Other division due to an increase of resources utilized at the Itmann Mine (as a result of its continued development), closed mines and in other business development activities as compared to the prior year.
(Gain) Loss on Debt Extinguishment
Gain on debt extinguishment of $21 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, which traded substantially below par value.
Loss on debt extinguishment of $24 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, the $110 million required repayment on the Term Loan B Facility, and the refinancing of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility. See Note 13 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, is comprised of interest on the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 and the 5.75% MEDCO Revenue Bonds. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased $5 million in the period-to-period comparison, primarily related to the $110 million required repayment on the Term Loan B Facility, as well as the refinancing of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility, both of which occurred during the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is also attributable to repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaling approximately $54 million and $53 million, respectively (see Note 5 - Stock and Debt Repurchases of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and at the date of the financial statements. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. CONSOL Energy bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current coal mine disturbance and final coal mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of the Company's total asset retirement obligations, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $238 million at December 31, 2021. This liability is reviewed annually, or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary, by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly.
Accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. For active locations, the present value of the estimated asset retirement obligations is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. For locations that have been fully depleted or closed, the present value of the change is recorded directly to the consolidated statements of income. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the reclamation of land upon mine closure, the treatment of mine water discharge where necessary, and the plugging of gas wells acquired for mining purposes. Changes in the assumptions used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the asset retirement obligations. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future expenditures, estimated mine lives, assumptions involving inflation rates and the assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.
Accounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement obligation and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets.
The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the Company must assess the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company’s assumptions.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $57 million. At December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy had a valuation allowance of $1 million on deferred tax assets.
CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is reversed when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that CONSOL Energy believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. At December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy has liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $4 million. There were no liabilities for uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. When evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the Company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income. In making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company’s assumptions. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, CONSOL has valuation allowances related to net operating losses of $1 million and $3 million, respectively.
Recoverable Coal Reserves
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about CONSOL Energy's reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by the Company's staff. CONSOL Energy's coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third-party consultant. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include:
•
geological conditions;
•
historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;
•
the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;
•
assumptions governing future prices; and
•
future operating costs.
Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating CONSOL Energy's reserves.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
CONSOL Energy's potential sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility and securitization facility (which are discussed below), the proceeds of the sale of the PEDFA Bonds loaned to us (discussed below) and, if necessary, the ability to issue additional equity or debt securities. The Company believes that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet its short-term working capital requirements, long-term capital expenditure requirements, and debt servicing obligations, as well as to provide required letters of credit.
The demand for coal experienced unprecedented decline but has substantially improved since the significant COVID-related demand trough in the second quarter of 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made repayments of $28 million, $25 million, $17 million and $31 million on its equipment-financed debt, Term Loan A Facility, 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and Term Loan B Facility, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, our total liquidity was $381 million, which comprises $150 million of cash and cash equivalents and the remaining capacity of $231 million on our revolving credit facility.
While many government-imposed shut-downs of non-essential businesses in the United States and abroad have been phased out, there is a possibility that additional shut-downs may be reinstated if the severity of the pandemic grows. Depressed demand for our coal may also result from a general recession or reduction in overall business activity caused by COVID-19. During the widespread government-imposed shut-downs in fiscal year 2020, some of our customers unsuccessfully attempted to invoke force majeure or similar provisions in the contracts they have in place with us in order to avoid taking possession of and paying us for our coal that they are contractually obligated to purchase. A decrease in demand for our coal, the failure of our customers to purchase coal from us that they are obligated to purchase pursuant to existing contracts, or disruptions in the logistics chain preventing us from shipping our coal would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. During the 2021 fiscal year and continuing into 2022, CONSOL Energy has encountered multiple transportation delays as a result of the disruption of the global supply chain and logistics infrastructure. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of COVID-19 variants, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects. We expect this could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company will continue to take steps it believes are appropriate to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on its operations, liquidity and financial condition.
The Company expects to maintain adequate liquidity through its operating cash flow and revolving credit facility to fund its working capital and capital expenditures in the short-term and long-term. The Company's cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was supported by its contracted position, strong spot market activity and its ongoing cost and capital control measures.
The Company started a capital construction project on the coarse refuse disposal area in 2017, which is expected to continue through 2023. The construction on the coarse refuse disposal area is now funded, in part, by the $75 million of tax-exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were loaned to the Company and which the Company expects to expend over approximately the next two years, as qualified work is completed. Through the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received reimbursement for qualified expenses from restricted cash held in escrow in the amount of $29 million. The Company has $46 million remaining in restricted cash associated with this financing that will be used to fund future spending on the coarse refuse disposal area. The Company also began construction of the Itmann Mine in the second half of 2019; development mining began in April 2020, and full production is expected following construction of a preparation plant near the mine site, which is planned for completion during the second half of 2022. When fully operational, the Company anticipates approximately 900 thousand product tons per year of high-quality, low-vol coking coal production from the Itmann Mine. The preparation plant being constructed also includes a highly efficient rail loadout and the capability for processing up to an additional 750 thousand to 1 million third-party product tons annually. This potential third-party processing revenue is expected to provide an additional avenue of growth for the Company.
Uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to CONSOL Energy. These risks include a reduction of our ability to raise capital in the equity markets, less availability and higher costs of additional credit and potential counterparty defaults. Overall market disruptions, similar to what was experienced in 2020, may impact the Company's collection of trade receivables. As a result, CONSOL Energy regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and counterparties and manages credit exposure through payment terms, credit limits, prepayments and security.
Over the past few years, the insurance and surety markets have been increasingly challenging, particularly for coal companies. We have experienced rising premiums, reduced coverage and/or fewer providers willing to underwrite policies and surety bonds. Terms have generally become more unfavorable, including increases in the amount of collateral required to secure surety bonds. Further cost burdens on our ability to maintain adequate insurance and bond coverage may adversely impact our operations, financial position and liquidity.
The Company initiated an API2 hedging program in the second quarter of 2021. As a precursor to initiating this strategy, market dynamics demonstrated ongoing pricing volatility and a trend toward shorter-term export contracts. Given these factors, the Company has sought to utilize swap arrangements to mitigate the pricing volatility and secure future cash flows for a portion of 2022 export sales. These swap arrangements partially mitigate the Company's exposure to pricing volatility associated with its spot export business and certain of its physical contracts which contain variable pricing based on the API2 index.
CONSOL Energy participates in the United Mine Workers of America (the “UMWA”) Combined Benefit Fund and the UMWA 1992 Benefit Plan which generally accepted accounting principles recognize on a pay-as-you-go basis. These benefit arrangements may result in additional liabilities that are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. The various multi-employer benefit plans are discussed in Note 17-Other Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. CONSOL Energy's total contributions under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 were $4,760, $5,383 and $6,042 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on available information at December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy's obligation for the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund and 1992 Benefit Plan is estimated to be approximately $46,381. CONSOL Energy also uses a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees and letters of credit to secure its financial obligations for employee-related, environmental, performance and various other items which are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. Management believes these items will expire without being funded. See Note 23-Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details of the various financial guarantees that have been issued by CONSOL Energy.
The Company is continuing to actively monitor the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and capital resources. As disclosed previously and above, we took several steps throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to reinforce our liquidity. From a coal shipment perspective, the decline in coal demand seemed to have hit its lowest point in May 2020 and has since shown significant improvement. However, if the demand for our coal decreases due to future COVID-19 variants or any potential government-induced lockdowns, this could adversely affect our liquidity in future periods. Our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility, Term Loan B Facility, Securitization Facility and the Indenture entered into in connection with our 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”) contain certain financial covenants. Events resulting from the effects of COVID-19 may negatively impact our liquidity and, as a result, our ability to comply with these covenants, which were amended during the second quarter of 2020. These events could lead us to seek further amendments or waivers from our lenders, limit access to or require accelerated repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facilities, or require us to pursue alternative financing. We have no assurance that any such alternative financing, if required, could be obtained at terms acceptable to us, or at all, as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on capital markets at such time.
Cash Flows (in millions)
Cash provided by operating activities increased $177 million in the period-to-period comparison, primarily due to a $117 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as well as other working capital changes that occurred throughout both periods.
Cash used in investing activities increased $51 million in the period-to-period comparison. Capital expenditures increased $47 million primarily due to an early buyout of an existing operating lease for a set of longwall shields and the construction of a preparation plant near the Itmann Mine. Further details regarding the Company's capital expenditures are set forth below.
Cash used in financing activities decreased $51 million in the period-to-period comparison, primarily driven by the receipt of $75 million in proceeds loaned to the Company from the issuance of Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority tax-exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds during the year ended December 31, 2021. This was offset, in part, by an increase in net payments on indebtedness in the period-to-period comparison due to the Company's ongoing de-leveraging efforts.
Senior Secured Credit Facilities
In November 2017, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with PNC Bank, N.A. with commitments up to $300 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a Term Loan A Facility of up to $100 million (the “TLA Facility”) and a Term Loan B Facility of up to $400 million (the “TLB Facility”, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). On March 28, 2019, the Company amended the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to increase the borrowing commitment of the Revolving Credit Facility to $400 million and reallocate the principal amounts outstanding under the TLA Facility and the TLB Facility. On June 5, 2020, the Company amended the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “amendment”) to provide eight quarters of financial covenant relaxation, effect an increase in the rate at which borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility bear interest, and add an anti-cash hoarding provision. On March 29, 2021, the Company amended the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to revise the negative covenant with respect to other indebtedness to allow the Company to incur obligations under the tax-exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds. Borrowings under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a floating rate which can be, at the Company's option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility depends on the total net leverage ratio, whereas the applicable margin for the TLB Facility is fixed. The amendment increased the applicable margin by 50 basis points on both the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit and TLA Facilities is March 28, 2023. The TLB Facility's maturity date is September 28, 2024. In June 2019, the TLA Facility began amortizing in equal quarterly installments of (i) 3.75% of the original principal amount thereof, for four consecutive quarterly installments commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2019, (ii) 6.25% of the original principal amount thereof for the subsequent eight quarterly installments commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and (iii) 8.75% of the original principal amount thereof for the quarterly installments thereafter, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. In June 2019, the TLB Facility began amortizing in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% per annum of the amended principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity.
Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by (i) all owners of the PAMC held by the Company, (ii) any other members of the Company’s group that own any portion of the collateral securing the Revolving Credit Facility, and (iii) subject to certain customary exceptions and agreed materiality thresholds, all other existing or future direct or indirect wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of the Company. The obligations are secured by, subject to certain exceptions (including a limitation of pledges of equity interests in certain subsidiaries and certain thresholds with respect to real property), a first-priority lien on (i) the Company’s interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, (ii) the equity interests in the Partnership held by the Company (iii) the CONSOL Marine Terminal, (iv) the Itmann Mine, and (v) the 1.4 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves and Resources. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of customary affirmative covenants. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of negative covenants, including (subject to certain exceptions) limitations on (among other things): indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments, and prepayments of junior indebtedness. The amendment added additional conditions to be met for the covenants relating to investments in joint ventures, general investments, share repurchases, dividends, and repurchases of the Second Lien Notes (as defined below). The additional conditions require that there be no outstanding borrowings and no more than $200 million of outstanding letters of credit on the Revolving Credit Facility. Further restrictions apply to investments in joint ventures, share repurchases and dividends that require the total net leverage ratio shall not be greater than 2.00 to 1.00.
The Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility also include financial covenants, including (i) a maximum first lien gross leverage ratio, (ii) a maximum total net leverage ratio, and (iii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The maximum first lien gross leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated EBITDA, as used in the covenant calculation, excludes non-cash compensation expenses, non-recurring transaction expenses, extraordinary gains and losses, gains and losses on discontinued operations, non-cash charges related to legacy employee liabilities and gains and losses on debt extinguishment, and subtracts cash payments related to legacy employee liabilities. The maximum total net leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness, minus Cash on Hand, to Consolidated EBITDA. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Fixed Charges. Consolidated Fixed Charges, as used in the covenant calculation, include cash interest payments, cash payments for income taxes, scheduled debt repayments, dividends paid, and Maintenance Capital Expenditures. The amendment revised the financial covenants applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility relating to the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio, maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, so that:
•
for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2020 through March 31, 2021, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 2.50 to 1.00, the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 3.75 to 1.00, and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio shall be 1.00 to 1.00;
•
for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2021 through September 30, 2021, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 2.25 to 1.00 and the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 3.50 to 1.00;
• for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio shall be 1.05 to 1.00;
•
for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 2.00 to 1.00 and the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 3.25 to 1.00; and
•
for the fiscal quarters ending on or after June 30, 2022, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 1.75 to 1.00, the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 2.75 to 1.00 and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio shall be 1.10 to 1.00.
The maximum first lien gross leverage ratio was 0.97 to 1.00 at December 31, 2021. The maximum total net leverage ratio was 1.49 to 1.00 at December 31, 2021. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.73 to 1.00 at December 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2021.
The TLB Facility also includes a financial covenant that requires the Company to repay a certain amount of its borrowings under the TLB Facility within ten business days after the date it files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC if the Company has excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) during the year covered by the applicable Annual Report on Form 10-K. There was no required repayment during the year ended December 31, 2020 with respect to the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy made the required repayment of approximately $5 million based on the amount of the Company's excess cash flow as of December 31, 2020. As a result of achieving certain financial metrics as of December 31, 2021, the Company is not required to make an excess cash flow payment with respect to the year ended December 31, 2021. The required repayment is equal to a certain percentage of the Company’s excess cash flow for such year, ranging from 0% to 75% depending on the Company’s total net leverage ratio, less the amount of certain voluntary prepayments made by the Company, if any, under the TLB Facility during such fiscal year.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, which effectively converted $150 million of the TLB Facility's floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, and $50 million of the TLB Facility's floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022.
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments when due, cross-default and cross-judgment default and certain bankruptcy and insolvency events.
At December 31, 2021, the Revolving Credit Facility had no borrowings outstanding and $169 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $231 million of unused capacity. From time to time, CONSOL Energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agencies' statutes and regulations. CONSOL Energy sometimes uses letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce the Company's borrowing facility capacity.
Securitization Facility
On November 30, 2017, (1)(i) CONSOL Marine Terminals LLC, as an originator of receivables, (ii) CONSOL Pennsylvania Coal Company LLC (“CONSOL Pennsylvania”), as an originator of receivables and as initial servicer of the receivables for itself and the other originators (collectively, the “Originators”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, and (iii) CONSOL Funding LLC (the “SPV”), a Delaware special purpose entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, as buyer, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) and (2)(i) CONSOL Thermal Holdings LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, as sub-originator (the “Sub-Originator”), and (ii) CONSOL Pennsylvania, as buyer and as initial servicer of the receivables for itself and the Sub-Originator, entered into a Sub-Originator Sale Agreement (the “Sub-Originator PSA”). In addition, on November 30, 2017, the SPV entered into a Receivables Financing Agreement (the “Receivables Financing Agreement”) by and among (i) the SPV, as borrower, (ii) CONSOL Pennsylvania, as initial servicer, (iii) PNC Bank, as administrative agent, LC Bank and lender, and (iv) the additional persons from time to time party thereto as lenders. Together, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Sub-Originator PSA and the Receivables Financing Agreement establish the primary terms and conditions of an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization”). In March 2020, the securitization facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date from August 30, 2021 to March 27, 2023.
Pursuant to the Securitization, (i) the Sub-Originator sells current and future trade receivables to CONSOL Pennsylvania and (ii) the Originators sell and/or contribute current and future trade receivables (including receivables sold to CONSOL Pennsylvania by the Sub-Originator) to the SPV and the SPV, in turn, pledges its interests in the receivables to PNC Bank, which either makes loans or issues letters of credit on behalf of the SPV. The maximum amount of advances and letters of credit outstanding under the Securitization may not exceed $100 million.
Loans under the Securitization accrue interest at a reserve-adjusted LIBOR market index rate equal to the one-month Eurodollar rate. Loans and letters of credit under the Securitization also accrue a program fee and a letter of credit participation fee, respectively, ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum depending on the total net leverage ratio of CONSOL Energy. In addition, the SPV paid certain structuring fees to PNC Capital Markets LLC and will pay other customary fees to the lenders, including a fee on unused commitments equal to 0.60% per annum.
The SPV’s assets and credit are not available to satisfy the debts and obligations owed to the creditors of CONSOL Energy, the Sub-Originator or any of the Originators. The Sub-Originator, the Originators and CONSOL Pennsylvania as servicer are independently liable for their own customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities. In addition, CONSOL Energy has guaranteed the performance of the obligations of the Sub-Originator, the Originators and CONSOL Pennsylvania as servicer, and will guarantee the obligations of any additional originators or successor servicer that may become party to the Securitization. However, neither CONSOL Energy nor its affiliates will guarantee collectability of receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors thereunder.
The agreements comprising the Securitization contain various customary representations and warranties, covenants and default provisions which provide for the termination and acceleration of the commitments and loans under the Securitization in certain circumstances including, but not limited to, failure to make payments when due, breach of representation, warranty or covenant, certain insolvency events or failure to maintain the security interest in the trade receivables, and defaults under other material indebtedness.
At December 31, 2021, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $22 million. At December 31, 2021, the facility had no outstanding borrowings and $22 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving no unused capacity. CONSOL Energy posted $157 thousand of cash collateral to secure the difference in outstanding letters of credit and the eligible accounts receivable. Costs associated with the receivables facility totaled $1,048 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. These costs have been recorded as financing fees which are included in Operating and Other Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company has not derecognized any receivables due to its continued involvement in the collections efforts.
11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025
On November 13, 2017, the Company issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 (the “Second Lien Notes”) pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of November 13, 2017, by and between the Company and UMB Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee and collateral trustee (the “Trustee”). On November 28, 2017, certain subsidiaries of the Company executed a supplement to the Indenture and became party to the Indenture as a guarantor (the “Guarantors”). The Second Lien Notes are secured by second priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors that are pledged and on a first-priority basis as collateral securing the Company’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (described above), subject to certain exceptions under the Indenture.
Since November 15, 2021, the Company has had the right to redeem all or part of the Second Lien Notes at the redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of the Second Lien Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), beginning on November 15 of the years indicated:
Prior to November 15, 2021, the Company had the right to redeem all or a part of the Second Lien Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium, as defined in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of the Second Lien Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not redeemed the Second Lien Notes, in part or in full.
The Indenture contains covenants that will limit the ability of the Company and the Guarantors, to (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness; (iii) declare or pay dividends on the Company’s common stock, redeem stock or make other distributions to the Company’s stockholders; (iv) make investments; (v) restrict dividends, loans or other asset transfers from the Company’s restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of the Company’s assets; (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (ix) create unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If the Second Lien Notes achieve an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and no default under the Indenture exists, many of the foregoing covenants will terminate and cease to apply. The Indenture also contains customary events of default, including (i) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (ii) default in payment when due of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (iii) covenant defaults; (iv) cross-defaults to certain indebtedness, and (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of the Guarantors. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Second Lien Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an event of default arises from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Company, any restricted subsidiary of the Company that is a significant subsidiary or any group of restricted subsidiaries of the Company that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary, all outstanding Second Lien Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.
If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control, holders of the Second Lien Notes will be entitled to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of that holder’s Second Lien Notes pursuant to an offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. The Company will offer to make a cash payment equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Second Lien Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
The Second Lien Notes were issued in a private offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A and to persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority Bonds
In April 2021, CONSOL Energy borrowed the proceeds received from the sale of tax-exempt bonds issued by the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority ("PEDFA") in aggregate principal amount of $75 million. The PEDFA Bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.00% for an initial term of seven years. The PEDFA Bonds mature on April 1, 2051, but are subject to mandatory purchase by the Company on April 13, 2028, at the expiration of the initial term rate period. The PEDFA Bonds were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “PEDFA Indenture”) dated as of April 1, 2021, by and between PEDFA and Wilmington Trust, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the “PEDFA Notes Trustee”). PEDFA made a loan of the proceeds of the PEDFA Bonds to the Company pursuant to a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) dated as of April 1, 2021 between PEDFA and the Company. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company agreed to make all payments of principal, interest and other amounts at any time due on the PEDFA Bonds or under the PEDFA Indenture. PEDFA assigned its rights as lender under the Loan Agreement, excluding certain reserved rights, to the PEDFA Notes Trustee. Certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “PEDFA Notes Guarantors”) executed a Guaranty Agreement (the “Guaranty”) dated as of April 1, 2021 in favor of the PEDFA Notes Trustee, guarantying the obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement to pay the PEDFA Bonds when and as due. The obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement and of the PEDFA Notes Guarantors under the Guaranty are secured by second priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the PEDFA Notes Guarantors on parity with the Second Lien Notes. The Loan Agreement and Guaranty incorporate by reference covenants in the Indenture under which the Second Lien Notes were issued (discussed above).
Material Cash Requirements
CONSOL Energy expects to make payments of $78,910 on its long-term debt obligations, including interest, in 2022. Refer to Note 13 - Long-Term Debt for additional information concerning material cash requirements in future years. CONSOL Energy expects to make payments of $30,835 on its operating and finance lease obligations, including interest, in 2022.

Interest on the industrial revenue bonds is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and interest on the notes is guaranteed by CONSOL Energy.
• An aggregate principal amount of $75 million of tax-exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds, which were issued to finance the ongoing expansion of the coal refuse disposal area at the Bailey Preparation Plant, which bear interest at 9.00% per annum for an initial term of seven years and mature in April 2051. Interest on the tax-exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

At December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy had no borrowings outstanding and approximately $169 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $400 million senior secured Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy had no borrowings outstanding and approximately $22 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $100 million Securitization Facility.
Stock and Debt Repurchases
In December 2017, CONSOL Energy’s Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase, from time to time, the Company's outstanding shares of common stock or its 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025. Since its inception, the Company's Board of Directors has subsequently amended the program several times, the most recent of which amendment in April 2021 raised the aggregate limit of the Company's repurchase authority to $320 million and extended the program until December 31, 2022.
Under the terms of the program, CONSOL Energy is permitted to make repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or in structured share repurchase programs. CONSOL Energy is also authorized to enter into one or more 10b5-1 plans with respect to any of the repurchases. Any repurchases of common stock or notes are to be funded from available cash on hand or short-term borrowings. The program does not obligate CONSOL Energy to acquire any particular amount of its common stock or notes, and can be modified or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The program is conducted in compliance with applicable legal requirements and within the limits imposed by any credit agreement, receivables purchase agreement, indenture or the tax matters agreement between the Company and its former parent and is subject to market conditions and other factors.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, CONSOL Energy spent approximately $17 million to retire $18 million of its 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, which continued to trade below par value during the first half of 2021. No shares of common stock were repurchased under this program during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Total Equity and Dividends
Total equity attributable to CONSOL Energy was $673 million at December 31, 2021 and $554 million at December 31, 2020. See the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.
On December 30, 2020, the CCR Merger was completed (see Note 2 - Major Transactions). CONSOL Energy accounted for the change in its ownership interest in the Partnership as an equity transaction, which was reflected as a reduction of noncontrolling interest with corresponding increases to common stock and capital in excess of par value.
The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energy's Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. The determination to pay dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energy's financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities limit CONSOL Energy's ability to pay dividends up to $25 million annually, which increases to $50 million annually when the Company's total net leverage ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00 and subject to an aggregate amount up to a cumulative credit calculation set forth in the facilities, with additional conditions of there being no outstanding borrowings and no more than $200 million of outstanding letters of credit on the Revolving Credit Facility, and the total net leverage ratio shall not be greater than 2.00 to 1.00. The Company's total net leverage ratio was 1.49 to 1.00 and the cumulative credit was approximately $160 million at December 31, 2021. The cumulative credit starts with $50 million and builds with excess cash flow commencing in 2018. Separately, the Indenture to the 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes limits dividends when the Company's total net leverage ratio exceeds 2.00 to 1.00 and subject to an amount not to exceed an annual rate of 4.0% of the quoted public market value per share of such common stock at the time of the declaration.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805). The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that enter into a business combination within the scope of Subtopic 805-10, Business Combinations-Overall. The amendments in this Update require that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The amendments in this Update do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with Topic 606. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, but does not expect this update to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04 - Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The amendments in this update affect all entities that issue freestanding written call options that are classified in equity. Specifically, the amendments affect those entities when a freestanding equity-classified written call option is modified or exchanged and remains equity classified after the modification or exchange. The amendments that relate to the recognition and measurement of EPS for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options affect entities that present EPS in accordance with the guidance in Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, but does not expect this update to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in Topic 848, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. Amendments in this Update to the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. The Company adopted this guidance in 2021, and there was no material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments in this Update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs), and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This Update also provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this Update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications by Topic or Industry Subtopic as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected for a Topic or an Industry Subtopic, the amendments in this Update must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. The Company adopted this guidance in 2021, and there was no material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 - Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in this Update clarify certain interactions between the guidance to account for certain equity securities under Topic 321, the guidance to account for investments under the equity method of accounting in Topic 323, and the guidance in Topic 815, which could change how an entity accounts for an equity security under the measurement alternative or a forward contract or purchased option to purchase securities that, upon settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option in accordance with Topic 825, Financial Instruments. These amendments improve current GAAP by reducing diversity in practice and increasing comparability of the accounting for these interactions. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in 2021, and there was no material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) to reduce the complexity of accounting for income taxes while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in Update 2019-12 will remove the following exceptions: (1) the exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and (3) the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments in Update 2019-12 will also simplify the accounting for income taxes in the areas of franchise tax, step up in the tax basis of goodwill associated with a business combination, allocation of current and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements, and presentation of the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The Update adds minor codification improvements for income taxes related to employee stock ownership plans and investments in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for using the equity method. These changes will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in 2021, and there was no material impact on the Company's financial statements.
