Overview
Southern States Bancshares, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “our” or “we”) is a bank holding company headquartered in Anniston, Alabama. We operate primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern States Bank (the “Bank”), an Alabama banking corporation. We provide banking services from 15 offices in Alabama and Georgia. The Bank is a full service community banking institution, which offers an array of deposit, loan and other banking-related products and services to businesses and individuals in our communities. Our principal business activities include commercial and retail banking.
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in the understanding of our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial statements; changes in certain key items in our financial statements from period to period; and the primary factors that we use to evaluate our business.
Recent Developments
On February 7, 2022, we entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements (each, a “Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers (the “Purchasers” and each, a "Purchaser") pursuant to which we issued and sold in a private placement $48.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our Line of Credit and to make purchases under the Program (as defined below) and intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including capital and liquidity to support our growth and further purchases under the Program.
On February 16, 2022, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "Program") that authorizes us to repurchase up to $10 million of our common stock. The Program will be in effect until December 31, 2022 with the timing of purchases and number of shares repurchased under the Program dependent upon a variety of factors including price, trading volume, corporate and regulatory requirements, and market conditions. We are not obligated to purchase any shares under the Program and the Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
Update Regarding COVID-19 and Current Developments
During the pandemic, we took steps to protect both customers and employees while continuing to provide full service banking. This included closing branches to walk-in business when appropriate and utilizing all drive through facilities and allowing for appointment-based banking. We increased cash levels in ATMs and communicated with customers regarding remote options for banking services. New technology was implemented to allow employees to work from home in addition to allowing for external parties such as auditors and examiners to continue to conduct necessary reviews and examinations.
We participated as a lender in the PPP as established by the CARES Act. Loans totaling $71.7 million were made to 399 existing customers. We proactively worked with customers to assist them in navigating through the pandemic. We granted deferrals on 396 loans totaling $280.1 million, or approximately 28.0% of our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, there were eight loans on deferral for a total of $8.0 million, or 0.78% of total loans. There was one loan remaining on deferral totaling $442,000, or 0.04% of total loans at December 31, 2021 , and such deferral ended in February 2022. We know of no significant customer issues resulting from the pandemic.
We participated in the second round of PPP loans, which has been substantially second requests from the 2020 PPP loan recipients. In the second round of PPP loans, $31.7 million of loans were made to 194 existing customers. We continue to actively monitor and consider COVID-19 implications in our operations, lending, and customer needs.

Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business
The most significant factors we use to evaluate our business and results of operation are net income, return on average assets and return on average equity. We also use net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is our principal source of net income and represents the difference between interest income and interest expense. We generate interest income from interest-earning assets that we own, including loans and investment securities. We incur interest expense from interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings, notably FHLB advances, subordinated notes and our Line of Credit.
Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income primarily consists of: (i) service charges on deposit accounts; (ii) swap fees; (iii) SBA/USDA fees; (iv) bank card services and interchange fees; (v) mortgage banking activities; (vi) benefits from changes in cash surrender value of Bank Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI"); and (vii) other miscellaneous fees and income.
Our income from service charges on deposit accounts, which includes nonsufficient funds fees, is impacted by several factors, including number of accounts, products utilized and account holder cash management behaviors. These are further impacted by deposit products utilized by customers, marketing of new products and other factors. The income recognized on SBA and USDA loans, mortgage banking and interest rate swaps are impacted by prevailing market conditions and volumes of loans originated.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense primarily consists of: (i) salaries and employee benefits; (ii) equipment and occupancy expenses; (iii) professional and other service fees; (iv) data processing and telecommunication expenses; (v) FDIC deposit insurance and regulatory assessments; and (vi) other operating expenses.
Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition
The most significant factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include asset quality, capital and liquidity.
Asset Quality
We monitor the quality of our assets based upon factors including level and severity of deterioration in borrower cash flows and asset quality. Problem assets are assessed and reported as delinquent, classified, nonperforming, nonaccrual or troubled debt restructurings. We also monitor credit concentrations. We manage the allowance for loan losses to reflect loan volumes, identified credit and collateral conditions, economic conditions and other qualitative factors.
Capital
We monitor capital using regulatory capital ratios. Factors used other than regulatory rules include overall financial condition, including the trend and volume of problem assets, reserves, risks, level and quality of earnings, and anticipated growth, including acquisitions.
Liquidity
Deposits primarily consist of commercial and personal accounts maintained by businesses and individuals in our primary market areas. We also utilize brokered deposits, Qwickrate certificates of deposits and reciprocal deposits through a third-party network that effectively allows depositors to receive insurance on amounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently $250,000. We manage liquidity based on factors that include the amount of core deposits to total deposits, level of non-customer deposits, short-term funding needs and sources, and the availability of unused funding sources.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
We had net income of $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.5 million, or 53.4%. The increased net income was substantially the result of overall asset growth and a $2.8 million gain on sale of a USDA loan that occurred during the first quarter of 2021. This increase was offset slightly by increased salaries and benefits expense on additional employees in both production and support.
The following table shows the average daily outstanding balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity, together with the average yields on our assets and average costs of our liabilities for the periods indicated. Yields and costs are calculated by dividing the annualized income or expense by the average daily balances of the corresponding assets or liabilities for the same period.
(1)Includes nonaccrual loans.
(2)Net interest spread is the difference between interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)Net interest margin is a ratio of net interest income to average interest earning-assets for the same period.
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates.
The following tables set forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to: (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate); and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been proportionately allocated to both volume and rate.
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $52.9 million compared to $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $11.3 million, or 27.3%. The increase in net interest income was comprised of a $7.5 million, or 14.9%, increase in interest income, plus a $3.8 million, or 44.1%, decrease in interest expense. The growth in interest income was primarily attributable to a $163.8 million, or 17.2%, increase in average gross loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, partially offset by a 0.12% decrease in the yield on gross loans. The increase in average gross loans outstanding was substantially due to organic growth. The $3.8 million decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily related to a 0.54% decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase of $124.3 million, or 14.8%, in average interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was due to organic growth. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.78% and 3.63%, respectively, compared to 3.64% and 3.37%, respectively, for the same period in 2020, which reflects the increases in interest income discussed above relative to the greater decreases in interest expense.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $3.0 million compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In December 2021, the provision was recorded primarily based on growth, and in December 2020, it included environmental factors related to the pandemic. In the year ended December 31, 2021, there were net recoveries of $3,000. In the year ended December 31, 2020, there were net charge offs of $706,000.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans was 1.18% and 1.15% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans, without including PPP loans, was 1.19% and 1.23% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10.8 million compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.3 million, or 26.5%. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1)Other income and fees include income and fees associated with miscellaneous services, the increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI, and BOLI death benefit payments.
Income from service charges on deposit accounts includes fees for overdraft privilege charges, insufficient funds charges, account analysis service fees on commercial accounts, and monthly account service fees. These fees increased $70,000, or 4.8%, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to increases in the volume of service fees and wire transfer fees.
Interest rate swap fees represent fees received when the Bank’s customer enters into a back-to-back swap agreement. This program was launched in May of 2020. These fees decreased $474,000, or 33.7%, to $931,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was the result of a reduction in transaction volume during 2021.
SBA/USDA fees primarily include gains on the sale of loans and servicing of the loans. These fees increased $3.2 million, or 424.9%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $756,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Bank realized a gain of $2.8 million on the sale of a USDA loan during the first quarter of 2021, which contributed to the large increase from 2020.
Bank card services and interchange fees are derived from debit cards and foreign ATM transactions. These fees increased $422,000, or 36.1%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of greater transactional volume and a change in provider that generated additional interchange fees during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Income from mortgage banking activities primarily includes origination fees and gains on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Income from mortgage banking activities decreased $64,000, or 4.2%, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a slow down of demand in the secondary market during 2021.
Net gains (losses) on securities decreased $799,000 to a net loss of $57,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a net gain of $742,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The loss in the year ended 2021 was the result of repositioning a portion of the securities portfolio into tax-exempt municipals during the first quarter of 2021. This was offset by net gains from market adjustments on equity securities during 2021.
Other income and fees decreased $105,000, or 7.1%, to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the end of a lease-back period for a new branch and operating facility in Birmingham, Alabama. This was offset as a result of the Bank receiving a larger amount of BOLI death benefits during 2021 compared to the amount received in 2020.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $36.4 million compared to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.3 million, or 13.2%, which primarily resulted from increases in salaries, performance-based compensation and employee benefits, professional fees, and other expense. This was offset by a reduction in other real estate expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1)Other expenses include items such as FDIC insurance, telephone expenses, marketing and advertising expense, debit card expenses, courier fees, directors’ fees, travel and entertainment expenses, and insurance.
Salaries and employee benefits primarily include: (i) amounts paid to employees for base pay, incentive compensation, and bonuses; (ii) health and other related insurance paid by the Bank on behalf of our employees; and (iii) retirement plans provided for employees including the 401(k) and non-qualified plans maintained for certain key employees. Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.9 million, or 15.5%, from $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to normal salary adjustments, increases in benefit and incentive costs, and the addition of production and support personnel in the fourth quarter of 2020 and early 2021. The number of full time equivalent (“FTE”) employees was 196 at December 31, 2021, compared to 188 at December 31, 2020.
Equipment and occupancy expenses consist of depreciation on property, premises, equipment and software, rent expense for leased facilities, maintenance agreements on equipment, property taxes, and other expenses related to maintaining owned or leased assets. Equipment and occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $3.6 million compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $42,000, or 1.1%. The decrease was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in maintenance expenses.
Professional services expenses, which include legal fees, audit and accounting fees, and consulting fees, increased $739,000, or 42.7%, to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily the result of a $285,000 increase in PPP administration expense, a $172,000 increase in SBA servicing expense, and an additional $300,000 in legal expenses primarily related to Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") properties during 2021.
Data processing fees, which primarily consists of data processing services for core processing from a third-party vendor, increased $292,000, or 15.9%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of general increases, and new services including a new lending platform that rolled out during the second quarter of 2021.
Other real estate (income) expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 115.6%, to a net income of $147,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a net expense of $945,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was substantially the result of write-downs and holding expenses incurred on foreclosed equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020 and net OREO rental income during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other expenses increased $1.5 million, or 27.8%, to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was substantially due to an increase in insurance expense as a result of going public, additional charitable donations, an increase in FDIC insurance expense based on the growth in assets, and additional debit card expenses. Public relations and travel/entertainment increased, which were unusually low in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial Condition
Total assets grew $450.1 million, or 33.8%, to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020.
Our loans, net of unearned income, increased $220.2 million, or 21.4%, to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Not considering the impact of PPP loans, the growth for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $277.5 million, which represents 28.8% growth.
Our securities portfolio increased $37.8 million, or 33.2%, to $151.8 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $114.0 million at December 31, 2020.
Cash and cash equivalents grew $199.0 million, or 234.4%, to $284.0 million at December 31, 2021, from $84.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Deposits grew $416.8 million, or 36.6%, to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The majority of the growth was in noninterest-bearing deposits and money market accounts.
Total stockholders’ equity increased $36.5 million, or 26.0%, to $177.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $140.7 million at December 31, 2020. This growth was due to new capital raised as a result of the IPO as well as strong earnings for the year.
Loan Portfolio
Loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing the Company’s financial condition.
The Company originates residential real estate loans for the secondary market. The Company sells the residential real estate loans exclusively to two private investors who solely and independently make the credit decision and set the closing conditions. The loans are closed in the Company’s name but are immediately assigned to the designated investor. These loans have an average turn time to purchase of 30 days or less. These mortgage loans are designated on the Company’s balance sheet as held for sale. This segment represents less than 0.002% of total loans based on the latest thirteen-month average.
We have three loan portfolio segments: real estate (“RE”) which is divided into three classes, commercial and industrial (“C&I”), and consumer and other. A class is generally determined based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristic of the loan, and method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. Classes within the RE portfolio segment include construction and development or (“C&D”), residential mortgages, and commercial mortgages.
Our loan clients primarily consist of small to medium sized business, the owners and operators of these businesses, as well as other professionals, entrepreneurs and high net worth individuals. We believe owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, residential construction loans and commercial business loans provide us with higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, and are complemented by our relatively lower risk residential real estate loans to individuals.
The following describes risk characteristics relevant to each of the loan portfolio segments:
Real estate-The Company offers various types of real estate loan products, which are divided into the classes described below. All loans within this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the valuation of real estate:
•Construction and development, or C&D, loans include extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of the real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral.
•Residential mortgages include 1-4 family first mortgage loans, which are repaid by various means such as a borrower’s income, sale of the property, or rental income derived from the property. These include second liens or open-end residential real estate loans, such as home equity lines. These loans are typically repaid by the same means as 1-4 family first mortgages.
•Commercial mortgages include both owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and other commercial real estate loans, such as commercial loans secured by income producing properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans made to operating businesses are long-term financing of land and buildings and are repaid by cash flows generated from business operations. Real estate loans for income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers are repaid from rent income derived from the properties.
Commercial and industrial-This loan portfolio segment includes loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, leases, or expansion projects. Loans are repaid by business cash flows. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of the underlying borrower, particularly cash flows from the borrowers’ business operations.
Consumer and other-This loan portfolio segment includes direct consumer installment loans, overdrafts and other revolving credit loans. Loans in this portfolio are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures.
The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of the composition of loans, excluding loans held for sale on the dates indicated:
Gross loans increased $220.4 million, or 21.3%, to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. The net increase in the Company’s gross loans was due to organic growth of $277.7 million and offset by a net decrease of $57.4 million in PPP loans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s participation in the PPP program resulted in new loans of $31.7 million and forgiveness of $89.1 million on existing loans. Portfolio segments and classes remained relatively consistent since December 31, 2020.
The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes of our gross loans by category at December 31, 2021:
The majority of our fixed rate loans have a one to five-year maturity. This type of loan has historically been about 50% of total loans over the past three years because the majority of our commercial loans are priced with five-year balloons.
The Company is primarily involved in real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer lending activities with customers throughout our markets in Alabama and Georgia. About 82.8% of our gross loans were secured by real property as of December 31, 2021, compared to 74.4% as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes that these loans are not concentrated in any one single property type and that they are geographically dispersed throughout our markets. Our debtors’ ability to repay their loans is substantially dependent upon the economic conditions of the markets in which the Company operates, which consist primarily of wholesale/retail and related businesses.
Commercial real estate loans were 57.1% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2021 and represented 49.8% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2020. C&D loans were 13.9% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2021, and represented 9.9% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2020. The regulatory concentration ratio of the Company’s commercial real estate loans to total risk-based Bank capital is 273.8% as of December 31, 2021 and 225.2% as of December 31, 2020. C&D loans represented 95.4% of total risk-based Bank capital as of December 31, 2021 as compared to 71.9% as of December 31, 2020. The regulatory concentration ratios of commercial real estate loans and construction and development loans to total risk-based capital as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were each below the 300%/100% concentration limits provided in regulatory guidance. Further, these loans are geographically diversified, primarily throughout our markets in Alabama and Georgia.
The Company has established concentration limits in its loan portfolio for commercial real estate loans by loan types, including collateral and industry, among others. All loan types are within established limits with the exception of the hotels/motels category, which have occasionally exceeded the Company’s limit of 50% of total capital. The Company capped its hospitality loans in January 2020 and multi-family loans in September 2020. This sector’s concentration is actively managed by the Senior Management team, including the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Risk/Credit Officer, and Chief Operating Officer.
The Company requires all business purpose loans to be underwritten by a centralized underwriting department located in Birmingham, Alabama. Industry-tested underwriting guidelines are used to assess a borrower’s historical cash flow to determine debt service, and the Company further stress tests the debt service under higher interest rate scenarios. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending to allow us to react to a borrower’s deteriorating financial condition, should that occur.
Construction and Development. Loans for residential construction are for single-family properties to developers or investors. These loans are underwritten based on estimates of costs and the completed value of the project. Funds are advanced based on estimated percentage of completion for the project. Performance of these loans is affected by economic conditions as well as the ability to control the costs of the projects. This category also includes commercial construction projects.
Construction and development loans increased $71.9 million, or 70.1%, to $174.5 million as of December 31, 2021 from $102.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The majority of this increase was due to continued loan growth primarily in the Georgia markets.
Residential. We offer one-to-four family mortgage loans on both owner-occupied primary residences and investor-owned residences, which make up approximately 68.8% of our residential loan portfolio. Our residential loans also include home equity lines of credit, which total $18.9 million, or approximately 12.8% of our residential portfolio as of December 31, 2021. By offering a full line of residential loan products, the owners of the small to medium sized businesses that we lend to use us, instead of a competitor, for financing a personal residence. We also offer multi-family loans, which comprise 17.3% of the portfolio. Other residential loans make up the remaining 1.1% of the portfolio.
Residential multi-family loans decreased $4.7 million, or 3.1%, to $147.5 million as of December 31, 2021 from $152.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The majority of this decrease was due to three large loans being paid off in the Auburn/Opelika, Alabama market.
Commercial Real Estate. The Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans for commercial property that is owned by real estate investors, construction loans to build owner-occupied properties, and loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments. Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to the Company’s commercial loans. These loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows for income-producing properties and collateral values for non-income-producing properties. The repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loans or the sale or refinancing of the property. Real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company’s real estate portfolio are diversified by type and geographic location. The Company believes the diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that may affect any single market or industry.
Commercial real estate loans increased $201.6 million, or 39.2%, to $716.5 million as of December 31, 2021 from $514.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase in commercial real estate loans during this period was mostly driven by general increases in lending activity, primarily in the Company’s Georgia markets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio was comprised of $322.6 million in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans and $72.3 million in commercial construction loans.
Commercial and Industrial. Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably. Underwriting standards have been designed to determine whether the borrower possesses sound business ethics and practices, to evaluate current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations, and to ensure appropriate collateral is obtained to secure the loan. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, or inventory, and typically include personal guarantees. Owner-occupied real estate is included in commercial and industrial loans, as the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the operations of the commercial borrower’s business rather than on income-producing properties or the sale of the properties.
Commercial and industrial loans, excluding PPP loans, increased $9.9 million, or 5.2% to $197.7 million as of December 31, 2021 from $187.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company sold a $20.6 million loan to USDA during the first quarter of 2021 that was originated at the end of 2020, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million.
Consumer and Other. The Company utilizes the central underwriting department for all consumer loans over $200,000 in total credit exposure regardless of collateral type. Loans below this threshold are underwritten by the responsible loan officer in accordance with the Company’s consumer loan policy. The loan policy addresses types of consumer loans that may be originated and the requisite collateral, if any, which must be perfected. We believe the relatively smaller individual dollar amounts of consumer loans that are spread over numerous individual borrowers minimize risk.
Consumer and other loans (non-real estate loans) decreased $935,000, or 9.7%, to $8.7 million as of December 31, 2021 from $9.6 million as of December 31, 2020.
Loan Participations
In the normal course of business, the Company periodically sells participating interests in loans to other banks and investors. All participations are sold on a proportionate (pro-rata) basis with all cash flows divided proportionately among the participants and no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset without the consent of all the participants. Other than standard 90-day prepayment provisions and standard representations and warranties, participating interests are sold without recourse. We also purchase loan participations from time to time.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 loan participations sold to third-parties (which are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets) totaled $81.7 million and $43.6 million, respectively. We sell participations to manage our credit exposures to borrowers. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we purchased loan participations totaling $62.1 million and $24.7 million, respectively. The variances come from purchases and sales of participations in the ordinary course of business.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is funded as losses are estimated through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Confirmed losses are charged off immediately. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
The allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, as well as probable credit losses inherent in the balance of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the uncollectibility of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, the overall portfolio quality, specific problem loans, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower’s ability to pay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. This evaluation does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions.
The allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for loan losses for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data.
A loan is considered impaired when it is probable, based on current information and events, that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans, for which the terms have been modified at the borrower’s request, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and are classified as impaired.
Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls are not generally classified as impaired. Impaired loans are measured by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less estimated costs to sell the collateral. Interest on accruing impaired loans is recognized as long as such loans do not meet the criteria for nonaccrual status. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment.
The Company’s homogeneous loan pools include commercial real estate loans, real estate construction and development loans, residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans. The general allocations to these loan pools are based on the historical loss rates for specific loan types and the internal risk grade, if applicable, adjusted for both internal and external qualitative risk factors. The qualitative factors considered by management include, among other factors, (1) changes in local and national economic conditions; (2) changes in asset quality and foreclosure rates; (3) changes in loan portfolio volume; (4) the composition and concentrations of credit; (5) the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing; (6) the experience and ability of lending personnel and management; (7) the effectiveness of the Company’s loan policies, procedures and internal controls; (8) current conditions in the real estate and construction markets; (9) the effect of entrance into new markets or the offering of a new product; and (10) the loan review system and oversight of our board of directors. The total allowance established for each homogeneous loan pool represents the product of the historical loss ratio adjusted for internal and external factors and the total dollar amount of the loans in the pool.
The allowance for loan losses was $14.8 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $11.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.0 million, or 25.2%. Additional provisions were recorded based on overall growth in loans.
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses as of the dates indicated.
Net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $3,000, a decrease of $709,000 compared to net charge offs of $706,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021, the extremely low level of credit issues resulted in minimal charge offs, which were more than offset by recoveries.
The following table presents the allocation of net charge offs (recoveries) to average gross loans by major loan category:
The following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each respective loan category with the corresponding percentage of loans in each category to total loans:
Nonperforming Loans
Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more. Delinquent loans may remain on accrual status between 30 days and 90 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the loan’s principal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes full collectability of principal and interest is probable.
A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include loans on nonaccrual status and performing restructured loans. Income from loans on nonaccrual status is recognized to the extent cash is received and when the loan’s principal balance is deemed collectible. Depending on a particular loan’s circumstances, the Company measures impairment of a loan based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is considered collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is based solely on the liquidation of the collateral. Fair value, where possible, is determined by independent appraisals, typically on an annual basis. Between appraisal periods, the fair value may be adjusted based on specific events, such as if deterioration of quality of the collateral comes to the Company’s attention as part of its problem loan monitoring process, or if discussions with the borrower lead us to believe the last appraised value no longer reflects the actual market for the collateral. The impairment amount on a collateral-dependent loan is charged off to the allowance if deemed not collectible and the impairment amount on a loan that is not collateral-dependent is set up as a specific reserve.
Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any write-down to fair value at the time of transfer to other real estate owned is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Costs of improvements are capitalized, whereas costs related to holding other real estate owned and subsequent write-downs to the value are expensed. Any gains and losses realized at the time of disposal are reflected in income.
Real estate, which the Company acquires as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, is classified as foreclosed assets until sold and is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new carrying value. Foreclosed assets totaled $2.9 million at December 31, 2021. One property for $2.9 million, is located in a desirable downtown area in Birmingham, Alabama but has routine legal issues which is delaying the sale.
Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus OREO and collateral taken in foreclosure or similar proceedings.
Total nonperforming loans decreased approximately $1.5 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The net decrease was primarily the result of one construction and development loan and one residential mortgage loan that were both paid off and one commercial real estate loan that was moved back to accrual status.
Nonperforming Assets
The following table sets forth the allocation of the Company’s nonperforming assets among different asset categories as of the dates indicated. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus OREO and repossessed property. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more.
(1) Troubled debt restructured loans are excluded from nonperforming loans unless they otherwise meet the definition of nonaccrual loans or are more than 90 days past due.
Securities Portfolio
The securities portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides liquidity supplement cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; (ii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool since it provides a large base of assets and the Company can change the maturity and interest rate characteristics more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other Company funding sources; (iii) it is an alternative interest-earning asset when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans; and (iv) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender.
The securities portfolio consists of securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity. All available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Securities available for sale consist primarily of state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities. All held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. Securities held to maturity consist of state and municipal securities. We determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:
Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At December 31, 2021, we evaluated the securities that had an unrealized loss for other-than-temporary impairment and determined all declines in value to be temporary. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not probable that we will be required to sell them before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.
The following tables set forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our investment securities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Weighted average yield is calculated by taking the sum of each category of securities multiplied by the respective yield for a given maturity, and dividing by the sum of the securities for the same maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
We maintain investments in BOLI policies to help control employee benefit costs, as a protection against loss of certain employees and as a tax planning strategy. We are the sole owner and beneficiary of the BOLI policies. At December 31, 2021, BOLI totaled $22.2 million compared to $22.5 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease represents a reduction in the policies’ total value due to an insured’s death net of increases in the cash surrender value.
Deposits
Deposits represent the Company’s primary and most vital source of funds. We offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposits accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts and certificate of deposits. The Company also acquires brokered deposits, QwickRate internet certificates of deposit, and reciprocal deposits through the Promontory network. The reciprocal deposits include both the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") and Insured Cash Sweep program. The Company is a member of the Promontory network, which effectively allows depositors to receive FDIC insurance on amounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently $250,000. Promontory allows institutions to break large deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other Promontory institutions to ensure full FDIC insurance is gained on the entire deposit. Generally, internet and reciprocal deposits are not brokered deposits for regulatory purposes.
Our strong asset growth requires us to place a greater emphasis on both interest and noninterest-bearing deposits. Deposit accounts are added by loan production cross-selling, customer referrals, marketing advertisements, mobile and online banking and our involvement within our communities.
Total deposits at December 31, 2021 were $1.6 billion, representing an increase of $416.8 million, or 36.6%, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, 34.8% of total deposits were comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 48.9% of interest-bearing non-maturity accounts and 16.3% of time deposits.
The following table summarizes our deposit balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The following tables set forth the maturity of time deposits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Time deposits issued in amounts of more than $250,000 represent the type of deposit most likely to affect the Company’s future earnings because of interest rate sensitivity. The effective cost of these funds is generally higher than other time deposits because the funds are usually obtained at premium rates of interest.
The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Our uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, were $851.4 million and $451.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following table presents the maturities of our time deposits in excess of the insurance limit of $250,000 as of December 31, 2021.
Borrowed Funds
In addition to deposits, we utilize advances from the FHLB and other borrowings as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations.
FHLB Advances. The FHLB allows us to borrow, on both short and long-term, collateralized by a blanket floating lien on first mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans as well as FHLB stock. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $68.4 million and $65.7 million, respectively. We had $26.0 million in short-term FHLB borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and $30.9 million as of December 31, 2020. We had no long-term FHLB borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. All our outstanding FHLB advances have fixed rates of interest.
The following table sets forth our FHLB borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Lines of Credit. The Bank has uncollateralized, uncommitted federal funds lines of credit with multiple banks as a source of funding for liquidity management. The total amount of the lines of credit was $87.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, all of which was available at these dates.
First Horizon Line of Credit. During 2019, the Company obtained the $25.0 million Line of Credit with First Horizon, which was extended in November 2020 and matures in August 2022. The Line of Credit is collateralized by 100% of the capital stock of the Bank. The Line of Credit includes various financial and nonfinancial covenants. The Line of Credit has a variable interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 0.50%, and requires quarterly interest payments. The Company utilized $8.0 million of the Line of Credit in connection with the purchase of East Alabama and another $4.5 million to redeem subordinated debt of $4.5 million. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was $12.5 million. The Company repaid the Line of Credit in full with the proceeds from the Notes.
Subordinated Debt Securities. In June 2016, the Company issued $4.5 million of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due July 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The 2026 Notes bore interest at 6.625% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year until July 2021. Thereafter interest was payable quarterly in arrears at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined for the applicable quarter plus 5.412%. The Company repaid the 2026 Notes in full on June 23, 2021.
On February 7, 2022, the Company issued $48.0 million in Notes, as referenced in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments".
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.
Interest rate sensitivity involves the relationships between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and is an indication of the probable effects of interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s net interest income. Interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are those with yields or rates that are subject to change within a future time period due to maturity or changes in market rates. A model is used to project future net interest income under a set of possible interest rate movements. The Company’s Asset Liability Committee, or ALCO, reviews this information to determine if the projected future net interest income levels would be acceptable. The Company attempts to stay within acceptable net interest income levels.
Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks, federal funds sold, and the fair value of unpledged investment securities. Other available sources of liquidity include wholesale deposits, and additional borrowings from correspondent banks, FHLB advances and the Line of Credit.
Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis.
The Company and the Bank are separate corporate entities. The Company’s liquidity depends primarily upon dividends received from the Bank and capital and debt issued by the Company. The Company relies on its liquidity to pay interest and principal on Company indebtedness, company operating expenses, and dividends to Company shareholders.
Capital Requirements
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for “prompt corrective action” (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
As of December 31, 2021, both we and the Bank exceeded all the minimum bank regulatory capital requirements to be well capitalized to which we and the Bank were subject.
The table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank in order to be considered “well capitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires, among other things, that the federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, an institution is defined to be well capitalized if it has a common equity tier 1 capital ratio (“CET1 capital”) of 6.5%, a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and it is not subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels.
We and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III and the Bank met all the minimum capital adequacy requirements to be considered “well capitalized” as of the dates reflected in the table below. As a bank holding company with less than $3 billion in total consolidated assets, Southern States is eligible to be treated as a “small bank holding company” under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement. As a result, Southern States’ capital adequacy is evaluated at the bank level and on a parent-only basis, and it is not subject to consolidated capital standards for regulatory purposes. The ratios set forth below as to Southern States are for illustrative purposes in the event Southern States were to become subject to consolidated capital standards for regulatory purposes. The column styled “Required for Capital Adequacy Purposes” includes the 2.5% capital conservation buffer.
Contractual Obligations
The following tables contain supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations at December 31, 2021.
We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to our customers is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the Company until the instrument is exercised. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they do for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount and nature of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the potential borrower.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private short-term borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.
The following table summarizes commitments we have made as of the dates presented.
Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk
As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our interest rate risk policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines.
Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income.
We manage our exposure to interest rates by adjusting our balance sheet assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk.
Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by ALCO in accordance with policies approved by the Bank’s board of directors. ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, ALCO considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management also employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of the relationships between interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analyses.
We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics.
Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the models. The average lives of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on decay assumptions and are incorporated into the models. All of the assumptions used in our analyses are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the models’ simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.
On a quarterly basis, we run a simulation model for a static balance sheet and other scenarios. These models test the impact on net interest income from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a 12-month and 24-month horizon based upon parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10% for a 100 basis point shift, 15% for a 200 basis point shift, 20% for a 300 basis point shift, and 25% for a 400 basis point shift.
The following tables summarize the simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated:
Inflation and increases in interest rates may result from fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus, and the Federal Reserve has indicated it is willing to permit inflation to run moderately above its 2% target for some time. Increases in interest rates may cause consumers to shift their funds to more interest-bearing instruments and to increase the competition for and costs of deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investment assets or from transaction deposits to higher interest-bearing time deposits, our funding costs may increase. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increases in market interest rates may reduce demand for loans, including residential mortgage loan originations. At the same time, increases in rates will increase the rates we charge on variable rate loans and may increase our net interest margin. Higher interest rates would decrease the values of our existing fixed rate securities investments and could potentially adversely affect the values and liquidity of collateral securing our loans. The effects of increased rates will depend on the rates of changes in our costs of funds and interest earned on our loans and investments and the shape of the yield curve.
Impact of Inflation
The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and conform to general practices within our industry. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical to understanding our financial statements.
The JOBS Act and our regulators provided us with an extended transition period to January 1, 2023 for complying with CECL accounting standards affecting public companies.
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that we believe require us to make the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned consolidated subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company includes all cash on hand, balances due from other banks, and federal funds sold, all of which have original maturities within three months, as cash and cash equivalents.
Securities. Investment securities may be classified into trading, held to maturity, or available for sale portfolios. Securities that are held principally for resale in the near term are classified as trading. Securities that management has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings but included in the determination of other comprehensive income. Management uses these assets as part of its asset/liability management strategy. These securities may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs, interest rates, resultant prepayment risk changes, and other factors. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other-than-temporary are included in gain or loss on sale of securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Loans. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the straight-line method, which is not materially different from the effective interest method required by GAAP.
Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, collection of interest is unlikely, which typically occurs when principal or interest payments are more than 90 days past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
Allowance for Loan Losses. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in the prospectus, as well as financial statements that we file in the future during the transition period, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Confirmed losses are charged off immediately. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Company’s allowance for loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans and general valuation allowances calculated based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends, discretionarily adjusted for general economic conditions and other qualitative internal and external risk factors.
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a quarterly basis by management and is based upon management’s review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in economic and market conditions. In connection with the determination of the estimated losses on loans, management obtains independent appraisals for significant collateral. The Bank’s loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real property, consumer assets, and other business assets.
While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on various factors. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Because of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the estimated losses on loans may change materially in the near term. However, the amount of the change that is reasonably possible cannot be estimated.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans rated substandard or worse and greater than $250,000 are specifically reviewed to determine if they are impaired. Factors considered by management in determining whether a loan is impaired include payment status and the sources, amounts, and probabilities of estimated cash flow available to service debt in relation to amounts due according to contractual terms. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
Loans that are determined to be impaired are then evaluated to determine estimated impairment, if any. GAAP allows impairment to be measured on a loan-by-loan basis by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if repayment is collateral dependent. Loans that are not individually determined to be impaired or are not subject to the specific review of impaired status are subject to the general valuation allowance portion of the allowance for loan loss.
Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale are comprised of residential mortgage loans. Loans that are originated for best efforts delivery are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value as determined by aggregate outstanding commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements. All other loans held for sale are carried at fair value. Loans sold are typically subject to certain indemnification provisions with the purchaser. Management does not believe these provisions will have any significant consequences.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The following provides a brief description of accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet adopted that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Please also refer to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 requires organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by the lease for all operating leases under current U.S. GAAP with a term of more than 12 months. The ASU is effective for non-public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on June 30, 2021 and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, “Leases -Targeted Improvements” to provide entities with relief from the costs of implementing certain aspects of the new leasing standard, ASU 2016-02. Specifically, under the amendments in ASU 2018-11: (1) entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the new leasing standard, and (2) lessors may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components when certain conditions are met. The amendments have the same effective date as ASU 2016-02 (January 1, 2022 for the Company). The Company adopted ASU 2018-11 on June 30, 2021 and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The new guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments including loans, debt securities held to maturity, net investments in leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The guidance will replace the current incurred loss accounting model that delays recognition of a loss until it is probable a loss has been incurred with an expected loss model that reflects expected credit losses based upon a broader range of estimates including consideration of past events, current conditions and supportable forecasts. The guidance also eliminates the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities, which will require re-measurement of the related allowance at each reporting period. The guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements intended to help financial statement users better understand estimates and judgement used in estimating credit losses. As originally issued, ASU 2016-13 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with institutions required to apply the changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to their retained earnings balance as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. On October 16, 2019, the FASB approved a delay in the implementation of ASU 2016-13 by two years for non-public business entities, including the Company. Management has been in the process of developing a revised model to calculate the allowance for loan and leases losses upon implementation of ASU 2016-13 in order to determine the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and, at this time, expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. The magnitude of any such one-time adjustments is not yet known but is not anticipated to be material.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (ASU 2017-12). The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company’s financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. ASU 2017-12 is effective for other than public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption, including adoption in an interim period, permitted. ASU 2017-12 requires a modified retrospective transition method in which the Company will recognize the cumulative effect of the change on the opening balance of each affected component of equity in the statement of financial position as of the date of adoption. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. The Company did not experience any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of ASU 2017-12.
