Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
The spread of the COVID-19 virus during the first half of 2020 has caused an economic downturn on a global scale, as well as significant volatility in the financial markets. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the spread of the COVID-19 virus a pandemic. The Company continues to monitor our supply chain and orders from customers
for COVID-19 pandemic related changes. In this time of uncertainty because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing to serve our customers while taking precautions to provide a safe work environment for our employees and customers. We have been staggering some shifts and otherwise adjusting work schedules to maximize our capacity while adhering to recommended precautions such as social distancing. We have established and implemented a work from home provision where possible. We may have to take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.
We experienced multiple confirmed case of COVID-19 during 2021 and 2020, which caused us to shut down our Garland facility for a few days to thoroughly clean the facility and address employee concerns. Our maquiladora contractor in Mexico was shut down during April and May of 2020 but reopened as of mid-June 2020.
To date, we have not experienced significant raw material shortages; however, supply-chain disruptions could potentially delay or prevent us from fulfilling customer orders.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold. The extent of the pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend in large part on future developments, which cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. Future developments include the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, the impact on governmental programs and budgets, the development of treatments or vaccines, the contagiousness and severity of Coronavirus variants, including Delta and Omicron, and the resumption of widespread economic activity. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation, we are unable to predict with any confidence the likely impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2021, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
The core principle of revenue recognition under accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (GAAP) is that the Company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue on the majority of its customer contracts are recognized at a point in time, generally upon shipment of products. The application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of
revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, the determination of whether revenues related to our revenue contracts should be recognized over time or at a point in time, as these determinations impact the timing and amount of our reported revenues and net income. Other significant judgments include the estimation of the point in the manufacturing process at which we are entitled to receive payment, as well as the progress of the job order to completion to determine the amount of consideration earned for contractual revenue recognized over time.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected.
Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. If we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would reduce our net income for that period.
Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property and equipment are based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets will provide benefit. Changes in circumstances related to a change in our business or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. The ASU requires the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost, in which companies will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for Smaller Reporting Companies, including interim periods within those fiscal years and requires a modified-retrospective approach to adoption. The Company believes that adopting ASU 2016-13 will have no material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.
