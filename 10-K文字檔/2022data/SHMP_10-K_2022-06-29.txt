Corporate History
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 3, 2008 under the name “Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc.” Effective November 5, 2010, we effected an 8-for-1 forward stock split, increasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 12,000,000 shares to 96,000,000 shares. On October 29, 2014, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, decreasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 97,000,000 to 9,700,000.
On November 26, 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“NSH”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of NSH which assets consisted primarily of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of NSC and NS Global, and certain real property located outside of San Antonio, Texas (the “Assets”).
On January 30, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of the Assets pursuant to the Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, we issued 75,520,240 shares of our common stock to NSH as consideration for the Assets. As a result of the transaction, NSH acquired 88.62% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock; NSC and NS Global became our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and we changed our principal business to a global shrimp farming company. We changed our name to “NaturalShrimp Incorporated” in 2015.
Business Overview
We are a biotechnology company and have developed proprietary platform technologies that allow us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled, high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent production facilities. Our system uses technology which allows us to produce a naturally grown shrimp “crop” weekly and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows us to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors, and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity, and temperature for optimal shrimp production. The Company’s production facilities are located in La Coste, Texas and Webster City, Iowa.
On October 16, 2015, we formed NAS. The purpose of NAS is to formalize the business relationship between our Company and F&T Water Solutions LLC (“F&T”) for the joint development of certain water technologies. The technologies shall include, without limitation, any and all inventions, patents, intellectual property, and know-how dealing with enclosed aquatic production systems worldwide. This includes construction, operation, and management of enclosed aquatic production, other than shrimp, facilities throughout the world, co-developed by both parties at our facility located outside of La Coste, Texas. On December 25, 2018, we were awarded U.S. Patent “Recirculating Aquaculture System and Treatment Method for Aquatic Species” covering all indoor aquatic species that utilizes proprietary art.
On December 15, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) between VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“VBF”), VBF Transport, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Transport”), and Iowa’s First, Inc., an Iowa corporation (“Iowa’s First”) (each a “Seller” and collectively, “Sellers”). Transport and Iowa’s First were wholly-owned subsidiaries of VBF. The agreement called for us to purchase all of the tangible assets of VBF, the motor vehicles of Transport and the real property (together with all plants, buildings, structures, fixtures, fittings, systems, and other improvements located on such real property) of Iowa’s First. The consideration was $10,000,000, consisting of $5,000,000 in cash, paid at closing on December 17, 2020, (ii) $3,000,000 payable in 36 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date, and (iii) $2,000,000 payable in 48 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date. The Company also agreed to issue 500,000 shares of Common Stock as a finder’s fee.
The facility was originally designed as an aquaculture facility, with the company having production issues. The Company’s has begun a modification process to convert the plant to produce shrimp, which will allow them to scale faster without having to build new facilities. The three Iowa facilities contain the tanks and infrastructure that will be used to support the production of shrimp with the incorporation of the Company’s Electrocoagulation (EC) platform technology.
On May 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Patents Purchase Agreement (the “Patents Agreement”) with F&T. The Company and F&T had previously jointly developed and patented a water treatment technology used or useful in growing aquatic species in re-circulating and enclosed environments (the “Patent”) with each party owning a fifty percent (50%) interest. Upon the closing of the Patents Agreement, the Company would purchase F&T’s interest in the Patent, F&T’s 100% interest in a second patent associated with the first Patent issued to F&T in March 2018, and all other intellectual property rights owned by F&T for a purchase price of $2,000,000 in cash and issue 9,900,990 shares of the Company’s common stock with a market value of $0.505 per share for a total fair value of $5,000,000, for a total acquisition price of $7,000,000. The Company paid the cash purchase price on May 20, 2021 and the closing of the Patents Agreement took place on May 25, 2021.
On August 25, 2021, the Company, through its 100% owned subsidiary NAS, entered into an Equipment Rights Agreements with Hydrenesis-Delta Systems, LLC (“Hydrenesis-Delta”) and a Technology Rights Agreement, in a sub-license agreement with Hydrenesis Aquaculture LLC (“Hydrenesis-Aqua”), The Equipment Rights involve specialized and proprietary equipment used to produce and control, dose, and infuse Hydrogas® and RLS® into both water and other chemical species, while the Technology sublicense pertains to the rights to Hydrogas® and RLS®. Both Rights agreements are for a 10 year term, which shall automatically renew for ten year successive terms. The term can be terminated by written notice by mutual consent, or by either party upon a breach of contract, insolvency or filing of bankruptcy. The agreements accord the exclusive rights to purchase or distribute the technology, or buy or rent the equipment, in the Industry Sector, which is the primary business and revenue stream generated from indoor aquaculture farming of any species in the Territory, defined as anywhere in the world except for the countries in the Gulf Corporation Council.
The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: NSC, NS Global, and NAS.
Evolution of Technology
Historically, efforts to raise shrimp in a high-density, closed system at the commercial level have been met with either modest success or outright failure through “BioFloc Technology.” Infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses are the most damaging and most difficult to control. Bacterial infection can in some cases be combated through the use of antibiotics (although not always), and in general, the use of antibiotics is considered undesirable and counter to “green” cultivation practices. Viruses can be worse, in that they are immune to antibiotics. Once introduced to a shrimp population, viruses can wipe out entire farms and shrimp populations, even with intense probiotic applications.
Our primary solution against infectious agents is our “Vibrio Suppression Technology.” We believe this system creates higher sustainable densities, consistent production, improved growth and survival rates and improved food conversion without the use of antibiotics, probiotics, or unhealthy anti-microbial chemicals. Vibrio Suppression Technology helps to exclude and suppress harmful organisms that usually destroy “BioFloc” and other enclosed technologies.
In 2001, we began research and development of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide quality, fresh shrimp every week, fifty-two weeks a year. Our initial system was successful, but we determined that it would not be economically feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from developing the first system, we developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have continued to refine this technology, eliminating bacteria and other problems that affect enclosed systems, and now have a successful shrimp growing process. We have produced thousands of pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment. However, there were further enhancements needed to our process and technology in order to begin production of shrimp on a commercially viable scale and to generate revenues.
Our current system consists of a nursery tank where the shrimp are acclimated, then moved to a larger grow-out tank for the rest of the twenty-week cycle. During 2016, we engaged in additional engineering projects with third parties to further enhance our indoor production capabilities. For example, through our relationship with Trane, Inc., a division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc (“Trane”), Trane provided a detailed audit to use data to build and verify the capabilities of then initial Phase 1 prototype of a Trane-proposed three tank system at our La Coste, Texas facility. The Company working with F&T Water Solutions contracted RGA Labs, Inc. (“RGA Labs”) to build the initial NaturalShrimp patented Electrocoagulation system for the grow-out, harvesting and processing of fully mature, antibiotic-free Pacific White Leg shrimp. The design provided a viable pathway to begin generating revenue and producing shrimp on a commercially viable scale. The equipment was installed in early June 2018 by RGA Labs, and final financing for the system was provided by one of the Company’s institutional investors. The first post larvae (PL) arrived from the hatchery on July 3, 2018. The Company used the shrimp for sampling to key potential customers and special events such as the Texas Restaurant Association trade show. The Company also received two production PL lots from Global Blue Technologies on March 21, 2019 and April 17, 2019 and from American Penaeid, Inc. on August 7, 2019. Because the shrimp displayed growth that was slower than normal, the Company had a batch tested by an independent lab at the University of Arizona. The shrimp tested positive for Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis (“IHHNV”) and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department was notified that the facility was under quarantine. On August 26, 2019, the Company was forced to terminate all lots due to the infection. On August 30, 2019, the Company received notice that it was in compliance again and the quarantine had been lifted and the Company began restocking shrimp in the refurbished facility sections. During the aforementioned quarantine, the Company decided to begin an approximately $2,000,000 facility renovation demolishing the interior 16 wood structure lined tanks (720,000 gallons). The Company began replacing the previous tanks with 40 new fiberglass tanks (600,000 gallons) at a cost of approximately $400,000 allowing complete production flexibility with more smaller tanks.
On March 18, 2020, our research and development plant in La Coste, Texas was destroyed by a fire. The Company believed that it was caused by a natural gas leak, but the fire was so extensive that the cause was undetermined. No one was injured as a result of the fire. The majority of the damage was to our pilot production plant, which comprised approximately 35,000 square feet of the total size of all facilities at the La Coste location of approximately 53,000 square feet, but the fire did not impact the separate greenhouse, reservoirs, or utility buildings. We received total insurance proceeds in the amount of $917,210, the full amount of our claim. These funds were utilized to rebuild a 40,000 square foot production facility at the La Coste facility and to repurchase the equipment needed to replace what was lost in the fire. As of the date of this report, this facility is production-ready and, while we have experienced supply chain issues due to COVID-19, we expect the combined output from the La Coste, Texas, and Webster City, Iowa should result in a total of 25,000 pounds of shrimp production for the calendar quarter that will end on June 30, 2022. Also, the Company is expecting to break ground on an 80,000 square foot expansion in La Coste during the third quarter 2022.
Recent Material Events
Securities Purchase Agreement - Secured Promissory Note
We entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with an investor (the “Investor”) on December 15, 2021. Pursuant to the SPA, the Investor purchased a secured promissory note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount totaling approximately $16,320,000 (the “Principal Amount”). The Note carried an original issue discount totaling $1,300,000 and a transaction expense amount of $20,000, both of which are included in the principal balance of the Note. The total purchase price of the Note was $15,000,000. The Note has an interest rate of 12% per annum. The maturity date of the Note is twenty-four (24) months from the issuance date of the Note (the “Maturity Date”). We also issued 3,000,000 warrants to Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC (the placement agent) as placement agent fees.
We used the proceeds from the Note, in part, to repay the amounts currently owing to VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. On December 23, 2021, the Company fully repaid the Notes with a payment of $4,556,164, of which $56,164 was interest. This included a $500,000 prepayment discount.
Beginning on the date that is six (6) months from the issuance date of the Note, the Investor has the right to redeem up to $1,000,000 of the outstanding balance per month. Payments may be made by the Company, at the Company’s option, (a) in cash, or (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), per the following formula: the number of redemption shares equals the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Repayment Price. The “Redemption Repayment Price” equals 90% multiplied by the average of the two lowest volume weighted average price per share of the Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date that the Investor delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. The right to pay the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock is subject to there not being any Equity Conditions Failure (as defined in the Note). The redemption amount shall include a premium of 15% of the portion of the outstanding balance being paid. In addition to the Investor’s right of redemption, the Company has the option to prepay the Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date by paying a premium of 15% plus the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date.
Within 180 days of the issuance date of the Note, we were to obtain an effective registration statement or a supplement to any existing registration statement or prospectus with the SEC registering at least $15,000,000 in shares of Common Stock for the Investor’s benefit such that any redemption using shares of Common Stock could be done using registered Common Stock. Although this 180 day deadline has passed, the Investor has not issued a notice of default with regard to the Note, and we expect to negotiate an extension of the time to comply with this provision.
As soon as reasonably possible following the issuance of the Note, we will cause our Common Stock to be listed for trading on either of (a) NYSE, or (b) NASDAQ (in either event, an “Uplist”). In the event the Company has not effectuated the Uplist by March 1, 2022, the then-current outstanding balance will be increased by 10%. We will make a one-time payment to the Investor equal to 15% of the gross proceeds the Company receives from the offering expected to be effected in connection with the Uplist (whether from the sale of shares of its Common Stock and / or preferred stock) within ten (10) days of receiving such amount. In the event Borrower does not make this payment, the then-current outstanding balance will be increased by 10%.
While the original Uplist deadline was March 1, 2022, the Investor has agreed to twice extend this deadline. The most recent extension was agreed to on May 18, 2022. In connection with the February 7, 2022 extension, the Company agreed that a one-time extension fee amount of $249,079 (less than two percent (2%) of the original Principal Amount) would be added to the outstanding balance of the Note.
The Uplist deadline was June 15, 2022. To the extent any event of default under the Note transaction documents had occurred prior to May 18, 2022, the Investor agreed to waive such event of default. Although June 15, 2022 has passed, the Investor has not issued a notice of default with regard to the Uplist deadline and we expect to negotiate an extension of the time to comply with this provision.
The Note is a secured obligation of the Company, to the extent provided for in the Security Agreement dated as of the date of the SPA (the “Security Agreement”) entered into by and among the Company and the Investor. The Note shall be senior in right of payment to all other Indebtedness (as defined in the Note) of the Company subject to the terms set forth in the Security Agreement. The Note is a direct obligation of the Company issued in accordance with the SPA. We granted a first priority security interest in and to all of the assets of the Company, provided, however, certain real property of the Company was to secured in favor of the Investor. Pursuant to the terms of the Note, there has been no increase in the Note’s outstanding balance nor has there been a notification of a Trigger Event.
Securities Purchase Agreement - Series E Preferred Stock and Warrant
On November 22, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with one accredited investor (the “Purchaser”), for the offering (the “Offering”) of (i) one thousand five hundred (1,500) shares of the Company’s Series E Convertible Preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Series E Preferred Stock”) at a price of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per share and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Warrant”), with an exercise price equal to $0.75, subject to adjustment therein. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser is purchasing the one thousand five hundred (1,500) shares of Series E Preferred Stock (the “Purchased Shares”) and the Warrant for an aggregate purchase price of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00). The Warrant expires on November 22, 2026, the five (5)-year anniversary of the issue date. The Offering was a private placement with the Purchaser. The Offering closed on November 23, 2021.
We received approximately one million three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,350,000.00) in net proceeds from the Offering before exercise of the Warrant and after deducting the commission of Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC (the placement agent) and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. We issued 267,429 warrants as placement agent fees.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and the other parties thereto, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the parties, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and other obligations of the parties.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, from the date thereof until the date when the Purchaser no longer holds any of the Purchased Shares or the Warrant (the “Securities”), upon any issuance by the Company of its securities for cash consideration (a “Subsequent Financing”), the Purchaser may elect, in its sole discretion, to exchange (in lieu of conversion), if applicable, all or some of the Securities then held for any securities or units issued in a Subsequent Financing on a $1.00-for-$1.00 basis and under the same terms and conditions as provided for in the Subsequent Financing.
The shares of Series E Preferred Stock have a stated value of $1,200 per share (the “Series E Stated Value”) and are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) at the election of the holder of the Series E Preferred Stock at any time at a price of $0.35 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”). The Series E Preferred Stock is convertible into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Series E Stated Value (plus any and all other amounts which may be owing in connection therewith) by the Conversion Price, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations.
We have the right to redeem the Series E Preferred Stock shares by paying, in cash, a premium rate (with such rate ranging from 1.15 to 1.25) multiplied by the sum of (a) the Stated Value and (b) all amounts owed pursuant the Series E Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (the “Certificate of Designation”) (included any accrued but unpaid dividends). The Company is required to redeem the Series E Preferred Stock shares on the one year anniversary of the date of issuance.
In addition, we shall, at the holder’s sole option, upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event and following a five (5) day opportunity to cure following written notice, to require the Company to redeem all of the Series E Preferred Stock shares for a redemption price, in cash, equal to the Triggering Redemption Amount ((a) 150% of the Stated Value and (b) all amounts owed pursuant the Certificate of Designation (included any accrued but unpaid dividends)). The Certificate of Designation defines Triggering Events as one of eleven (11) items including, a failure to deliver conversion shares, a failure to have a sufficient amount of authorized but unreserved shares available to issue to a holder upon a conversion, a bankruptcy event, a monetary judgment of over $500,000, and an event of default as defined in the Certificate of Designation.
Each holder of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by such holder, dividends at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, payable quarterly (the “Preferred Dividends”).
The holders of Series E Preferred Stock rank senior to the Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation and will vote together with the holders of the Common Stock on an as-converted basis, subject to beneficial ownership limitations, on each matter submitted to a vote of holders of Common Stock (whether at a meeting of shareholders or by written consent).
Registration Rights Agreement
On November 22, 2021, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Purchaser entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to, within fifteen (15) calendar days of November 22, 2021, the date of execution of the Rights Agreement, use its best efforts to file a registration statement or registration statements (as is necessary) with the SEC on Form S-1 (or, if such a form is unavailable, on such other form as is available for such registration) covering the resale of the Securities and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Securities, and pursuant to which the Company agreed that such registration statement will state, according to Rule 416 promulgated under the Securities Act, that such registration statement also covers such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock as may become issuable upon stock splits, dividends, or similar transactions.
The Warrant’s cashless exercise provision will go into effect if the Company violates the Rights Agreement.
Waiver
On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “April SPA”) to sell: (a) 9,090,909 shares of Common Stock at a price per share of $0.55; (b) warrants to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.75 per share (the “April Warrants”); and (c) 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock with a value (although no purchase price will be paid) of $0.65 per share, with GHS Investments LLC (“GHS”), an accredited investor. Pursuant to the April SPA, until April 14, 2022, GHS has a right to participate in any subsequent financing that the Company conducts.
On November 22, 2021, GHS entered into a Waiver (the “Waiver”) whereby GHS agreed to waive its right to participate in the Offering and to participate in a possible $16.32 million debt financing for which the Company is still negotiating definitive documentation. There is no guarantee the Company will be able to secure such debt financing at all or on favorable terms to the Company. GHS also agreed to waive its right, pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, to exchange shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by GHS for securities issued in the debt financing, if the Company enters into such financing.
In consideration for GHS entering into the Waiver, the Company agreed to lower the exercise price of the April Warrants to $0.35 per share (the Conversion Price) and to issue warrants to purchase 3,739,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.75 per share with such warrants being substantially in the form of the Warrants. The shares of Common Stock underlying the warrant issued to GHS are being registered in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
The foregoing descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, the Warrant, the Certificate of Designation, the Rights Agreement, and the Waiver are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such Purchase Agreement, Warrant, Certificate of Designation, Rights Agreement, and Waiver
The shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the Warrants and the GHS warrant were not registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. The issuance and sale of the Securities was made in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. No form of general solicitation or general advertising was conducted in connection with the issuance. The Securities contain (or will contain, where applicable) restrictive legends preventing the sale, transfer, or other disposition of such securities, unless registered under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom.
Resolution of Gary Shover Litigation
A shareholder of NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. (“NSH”), Gary Shover, filed suit against the Company on August 11, 2020 in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, alleging breach of contract for the Company’s failure to exchange common shares of the Company for shares Mr. Shover owns in NSH. On November 15, 2021, a hearing was held before the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division at which time Mr. Shover and the Company presented arguments as to why the Court should approve a joint motion for settlement. After considering the argument of counsel and taking questions from those NSH shareholders who were present through video conferencing link, the Court approved the motion of the parties to allow Mr. Shover and all like and similarly situated NSH shareholders to exchange each share of NSH held by a NSH shareholder for a share of the Company. A final Order was signed on December 6, 2021 and the case was closed by an Order of the Court of the same date. The Company is to issue approximately 93 million shares in settlement, which has been recognized as stock payable on the Company’s balance sheet, and its fair value of $29,388,000, based on the market value of the Company’s common shares of $0.316 on the date the case was closed, has been recognized in the Company’s statement of operations as legal settlement. As of March 31, 2022, the NSH shareholders have received 28,454,901 of the common shares of the Company issued for the settlement. As of the date of this report, 89,296,550 shares of common stock have been issued to the NSH shareholders.
Designation and Issuance of Series F Preferred Stock
On February 23, 2022, the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada delivered confirmation of the effective filing by the Company of its Certificate of Designation of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series F Designation”). The Series F Designation authorized the issuance of up to 750,000 shares of the Company’s Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”), having such designations, rights and preferences as set forth therein.
The number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock authorized or outstanding shall not be affected by a subdivision of the Common Stock (by any forward stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) into a greater number of shares, or by a combination of the Common Stock (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) into a smaller number of shares.
On March 1, 2022, the Board of the Directors of the Company (the “Board”) issued 250,00 shares of Series F Preferred Stock to each of Gerald Easterling, William Delgado and Thomas Untermeyer in consideration for their past and future services as executive officers of the Company.
At any time after the three year anniversary of each respective date of the issuance of any share of Series F Preferred Stock (in each case, the “Issuance Date”), each individual holder shall have the right, at each individual holder’s sole option, to convert all of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock that such individual holds into shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to 8% (eight percent) of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the day the Notice of Conversion (as defined in the Series F Designation) is sent to the Company. For the sake of clarity: (i) each individual holder cannot convert a portion of such holder’s shares of Series F Preferred Stock; rather, each individual holder must convert all of such holder’s holdings at the same time; and (ii) a reverse or forward stock split of the Common Stock will not affect the conversion rate.
Each individual holder of Series F Preferred Stock may only convert all of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock in one transaction. If the holder elects to convert all of its shares of the Series F Preferred Stock, it shall deliver three (3) days’ written notice thereof via email or overnight mail a notice of conversion (the “Notice of Conversion”) to the Company, listing the conversion date (the “Conversion Date”) which Notice of Conversion shall indicate (i) the holder is electing to convert all of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock, (ii) the Conversion Date, and (iii) the manner and the place designated for the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be converted.
On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), the Series F Designation authorizes each holder of outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock to cast one thousand (1,000) votes per each share of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holder as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.
Other than a change in par value or as a result of a stock dividend or subdivision, forward stock split, reverse stock split, split-up or combination of shares, at any time after the Issuance Date, in the case of any capital reorganization, any reclassification of the stock of the Company, or a Change in Control (as defined in the Series F Designation), the shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall, at the effective time of such reorganization, reclassification, or Change in Control, be automatically converted into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company or of the entity resulting from such reorganization, reclassification, or Change in Control to which such holder would have been entitled if immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, reorganization, reclassification, or Change in Control it had converted its shares of Series F Preferred Stock into Common Stock.
The Series F holders will not be entitled to dividends, nor any distribution rights in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended March 31, 2022 to the Year Ended March 31, 2021
Revenue
We have not earned any significant revenues since our inception and, although we expect revenues to begin in fiscal year 2023, we can provide no assurances as to how significant they will be at that time.
Expenses
Our expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 are summarized as follows, in comparison to our expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021:
Operating expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 were $54,474,975, an increase of approximately 1,550% as compared to operating expenses for the same period in 2021. The overall change in expenses is mainly due to the granting of stock compensation as well as the increase in salary, professional services, facility operations and other general and administrative expenses, as well as depreciation, and the amortization of the intangible assets. The Company’s issuance of 250,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock on March 1, 2022, to each of the three executive officers of the Company, for a total of 750,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, $43,612,000 was recognized as stock compensation. The fair value of the stock compensation has been recognized based on the estimated value of the instruments we would be obligated to provide to the holders upon their conversion to common shares, which for all three holders of Series F Preferred Stock would reflect 24% of the fair value of the outstanding common shares as of the grant date. The increase in professional fees is due to an increase in legal services related to the Gary Shover legal settlement, the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock, the new Series E and F Preferred Stock and services in connection with the expected listing of our common shares to Nasdaq, as well as an increase in accounting and consulting fees over the same period in the previous year. The increase in the other expenses were mostly based on the progress of the plants as well as the operations to begin the production of shrimp, including additional employees and maintenance. The increase in depreciation is due to the increase in fixed assets, including the acquisition with VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. during December 2020, for which the depreciation for the year ending March 31, 2022 is for a full fiscal year. The new amortization expense is for the patents acquired and the rights agreements entered into in the current year.
Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of approximately $1,734,000 and a working capital deficiency of approximately $17,017,000, as compared to cash on hand of approximately $156,000 and a working capital deficiency of approximately $3,614,000 as of March 31, 2021. The increase in the working capital deficiency for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 as compared to 2021 is mainly due to an approximate $4,018,000 increase in current assets, offset by approximately $17,421,000 increase in current liabilities, as discussed in further detail below.
The increase in current assets is based on the increase in cash on hand and the remaining $1,500,000 held in an escrow account from the proceeds of the convertible debenture, as well as an approximately $856,000 increase in prepaid expenses. The change in current liabilities is mainly a result of additions of the derivative liability of $13,101,000 fair value as of the year end, and the warrant liability fair value of $3,923,000 as of the end of the year, and, additionally, the increase in accounts payable and accrued interest.
Working Capital Deficiency
Our working capital deficiency as of March 31, 2022, in comparison to our working capital deficiency as of March 31, 2021, can be summarized as follows:
The increase in current assets is due to the remainder of the receipt of the cash for the December 15, 2021 convertible debenture including the $1,500,000 in escrow, as well as an approximately $856,000 increase in prepaid expense. The increase in the prepaid expense is mainly due to approximately $965,000 related to work being done at the Iowa facilities. The increase in current liabilities is primarily due to the addition of the derivative related to the new convertible note, with a fair value of $13,101,000 as of the year end. Additionally, due to the derivative, the existing warrants were classified as a liability, with a fair value of $3,923,000 as of the current fiscal year end. Lastly, there also is an increase of approximately $1,839,000 in accounts payable and $427,000 in accrued interest mostly related to the new convertible debenture. The increases in liabilities are offset by the settlement of bank loans and lines of credit and non-current short term notes and notes payable to related parties, as well as accrued expenses of approximately $316,000 related to the Vero Blue acquisition recognized in the gain on Vero Blue debt settlement.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2022, in comparison to our cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2021, can be summarized as follows:
The increase in net cash used in operating activities in the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 is attributable mainly due to the approximately $80,673,000 increase in the net loss being offset by the fair value of the shares issued for the legal settlement of $29,388,000 and the Series F Preferred Stock issued to the executive officers for a fair value of approximately $43,705,000. The offset of the increase in the net loss also consists of the addition this period of amortization of the new intangible assets, as well as the approximate $2,616,000 amortization of the debt discount related to the new convertible debenture. Furthermore, the offset includes the financing costs related to the transactions in connection with the new convertible note, which contains approximately $1,373,000 and $249,000, respectively, for an extension fee. In addition to the offsets, there also was an increase in accounts payable and prepaid expenses and the change in fair value of the warrant liability, which occurred in the current year.
The net cash used in investing activities in the year ended March 31, 2022 includes approximately $2,264,000 in cash paid for machinery and equipment and construction in process to continue to build our facilities. We paid cash of $2,000,000 towards the patent acquisition with F&T, and $1,000,000 in cash towards the acquisition of the shares of the non-controlling interest in NAS. Additionally, there was $2,350,000 in cash paid for the license agreement. In the same period in 2021, the Company had $5,000,000 in cash paid for the VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. asset acquisition, as well as $3,455,000 paid for machinery and equipment and construction in process to rebuild our La Coste facility and was offset by the $917,210 of cash proceeds received from the insurance settlement for the fire to the pilot production plant.
The net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately $12,625,000 between years. For the current period, we received approximately $17,277,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under an equity agreement, $13,905,000 in net proceeds from the new convertible debenture, as well as $1,348,000 from the sale of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company paid off bank loans and lines of credit for approximately $768,000, and notes payable and convertible debentures of approximately $5,673,000 (which included $655,750 to a related party). In the same period in the prior year, we received $3,250,000 from the sale of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $6,050,000 from the sale of Series D Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, and $600,000 from a new convertible debenture, as well as $103,200 from a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan, which was forgiven in the current fiscal year, and $50,000 connected to the Vista Capital Investments, LLC warrant settlement.
Our cash position was approximately $1,734,000 as of March 31, 2022. Management believes that our cash on hand and working capital are not sufficient to meet our current anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, as more fully described below.

Bank Loan
On April 10, 2020, the Company obtained a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan in the amount of $103,200 pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). On April 16, 2021, the Company filed for the forgiveness of the PPP loan and was approved for forgiveness of such loan on April 26, 2021.
On January 10, 2017, the Company entered into a promissory note with Community National Bank for $245,000, at an annual interest rate of 5% and a maturity date of January 10, 2020 (the “CNB Note”). The CNB Note is secured by certain real property owned by the Company in LaCoste, Texas, and is also personally guaranteed by the Company’s President, as well as certain shareholders of the Company. On January 10, 2020, the loan was modified, with certain terms amended. The modified note is for the principal balance of $222,736, with initial monthly payments of $1,730 through February 1, 2037, when all unpaid principal and interest will be due and payable. The loan has an initial yearly rate of interest of 5.75%, which may change beginning on February 1, 2023 and each 36 months thereafter, to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus 1%, but never below 4.25%. The monthly payments may change on the same dates as the interest changes. The Company is also allowed to make payments against the principal at any time. The note was paid off in full on December 20, 2021.
On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a short-term note agreement with Community National Bank for a total value of $50,000, with a maturity date of December 15, 2017. On July 18, 2018, the short-term note was replaced by a promissory note for the outstanding balance of $25,298, which bears interest at 8% with a maturity date of July 18, 2021. The note is guaranteed by an officer and director. The note was paid off in full in July of 2021.
Convertible Debentures
The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with an investor (the “Investor”) on December 15, 2021. Pursuant to the SPA, the Investor purchased a secured promissory note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount totaling approximately $16,320,000 (the “Principal Amount”). The Note has an interest rate of 12% per annum, with a maturity date 24 months from the issuance date of the Note (the “Maturity Date”). The Note carried an original issue discount totaling $1,300,000 and a transaction expense amount of $20,000, both of which are included in the principal balance of the Note. The Note had $2,035,000 in debt issuance costs, including fees paid in cash of $1,095,000 and 3,000,000 warrants issued to placement agents with a fair value of $940.000. The warrants were classified as a liability, as it is not known if there will be sufficient authorized shares to be issued upon settlement, based on the conversion terms of the convertible debt. The conversion feature meets the definition of a derivative and therefore requires bifurcation and will be accounted for as a derivative liability. The Company estimated the fair value of the conversion feature derivative embedded in the debenture at issuance at $12,985,000, based on assumptions used in a bi-nomial option pricing model.
Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date of the Note, the Investor has the right to redeem up to $1,000,000 of the outstanding balance per month. Payments may be made by the Company, at the Company’s option, (a) in cash, or (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), per the following formula: the number of redemption shares equals the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Repayment Price. The “Redemption Repayment Price” equals 90% multiplied by the average of the two lowest volume weighted average price per share of the Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date that the Investor delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. The redemption amount shall include a premium of 15% of the portion of the outstanding balance being paid (the “Exit Fee”). As the Exit Fee is to be included in every settlement of the Note, an additional 15% of the principal balance, which totals $2,448,000, was recognized along with the principal balance, and offset by a contra account in a manner similar to a debt discount. In addition to the Investor’s right of redemption, the Company has the option to prepay the Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date by paying a premium of 15% plus the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date.
The Note also contains certain negative covenants and Events of Default, which in addition to common events of default, include a failure to deliver conversion shares, the Company fails to maintain the share reserve, the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction without the Lenders written consent, the Company effectuates a reverse split of its common stock without 20 trading days written notice to Lender, fails to observe or perform or breaches any covenant, and, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, breaches any covenant or other term or condition contained in any Other Agreements in any material. Upon an Event of a Default, at its option and sole discretion, the Investor may consider the Note immediately due and payable. Upon such an Event of Default, the interest rate increases to 18% per annum and the outstanding balance of the Note increases from 5% to 15%, depending upon the specific Event of Default.
On February 26, 2021, the Company entered into a convertible note for the principal amount of $720,000, with an original issue discount of $120,000, convertible into shares of common stock of the Company. The note bears interest of 12% and is due six months from the date of issuance. The note is convertible from the date of issuance, at a fixed conversion rate of $0.36. The conversion rate shall change to $0.10 upon the event of default. The conversion feature at issuance meets the definition of conventional convertible debt and therefore qualifies for the scope exception in ASC 815-10-15-74(a) and would not be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative liability. The Company analyzed the conversion feature under ASC 470-20, “Debt with conversion and other options,” and based on the market price of the common stock of the Company on the date of funding as compared to the conversion price, determined there was an approximately $164,000 beneficial conversion feature to recognize, which will be amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method. The amortization of the beneficial conversion feature was $27,273 and the original issuance discount was $20,000, for the year ended March 31, 2021. In April 2021 the Company paid off approximately $422,000 of the convertible note. On April 16, 2021, the Company settled the convertible note, consisting of $720,000 in principal, approximately $13,000 in accrued interest, and approximately $110,000 in redemption fee, for a total of $842,972. The Company paid $421,486 in cash, and settled the remaining balance through the conversion into the issuance of 1,303,982 common shares.
Notes Payable
On December 15, 2020, in connection with the asset acquisition with VBF (Note 3), the Company entered into two notes payable with a third party. The first note, Promissory Note A, is for principal of $3,000,000, which is payable in 36 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date. Promissory Note B, is for principal of $2,000,000, which is payable in 48 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date. On December 23, 2021, the Company paid off the two notes, for a discount of $4,500,000, and recognized a gain on settlement of note, including accrued interest, of $815.943.
On July 15, 2020, the Company issued a promissory note to Ms. Williams in the amount of $383,604 to settle the amounts that had been recognized per the separation agreement with the late Mr. Bill Williams dated August 15, 2019 (Note 14) for his portion of the related party notes and related accrued interest discussed above, and accrued compensation and allowances. The note bears interest at one percent per annum and calls for monthly payments of $8,000 until the balance is paid in full. The balance as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 was $215,604 and $311,604, with $96,000 classified in current liabilities for both year ends on the consolidated balance sheets.

Series D Preferred Equity Offering

In addition, as further described in the Series D Designation, as long as any of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will not take certain corporate actions without the affirmative vote at a meeting (or the written consent with or without a meeting) of the majority of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding. On December 18, 2020, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements (the “Purchase Agreement”) with GHS Investments LLC, Platinum Point Capital LLC and BHP Capital NY (collectively, the “Purchaser”) , whereby, at the closing, each Purchaser agreed to purchase from the Company, up to 5,000 shares of the Company’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred Stock. The aggregate purchase price per Purchaser for the Series D Preferred Stock is $5,000,000. In connection with the sale of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Purchasers received 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Commitment Shares”), which have a fair value of $1,616,250 based on the market price of the common shares of $0.27 on the date of the Series D PS purchase. On January 8 and 10, 2021, the Company entered into additional securities purchase agreements with the Purchaser, for 1,050 shares of Series D PS, at an aggregate purchase price of $1,050,000.
Each holder of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by such holder, dividends at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (the “Preferred Dividends”). Dividends may be paid in cash or in shares of Preferred Stock at the discretion of the Company.
The Series D PS are convertible into Common Stock at the election of the holder of the Series D PS at any time following five days after a qualified offering (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) at a 35% discount to the offering price, or, if a qualified offering has not occurred, at a price of $0.10 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the designation.
The Series D PS were to be redeemed by the Corporation on the date that is no later than one calendar year from the date of its issuance. The Series D PS are also redeemable at the holder’s option, upon the occurrence of a triggering event which includes a change of control, bankruptcy, and the inability to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock requested under conversion notices. The triggering redemption amount was 150% of the stated value.
We used the proceeds of an offering that closed on April 14, 2021 to redeem 2,450 shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by two holders for a total of $3,658,000. In a concurrent private placement, we exchanged 3,600 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock held by GHS for 3,739.63 shares of the Company’s newly designated Series E Preferred Stock. As of April 14, 2021, there were no shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding.
Series E Preferred Stock
On April 14, 2021, the Board authorized the issuance of 10,000 shares of the Company’s Series E Preferred Stock. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock have a stated value of $1,200 per share and are convertible into shares of common stock at the election of the holder of the Series E Preferred Stock at any time at a price of $0.35 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”). The Series E Preferred Stock is convertible into that number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the Series E Stated Value (plus any and all other amounts which may be owing in connection therewith) by the Conversion Price, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. Each holder of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by such holder, dividends at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, payable quarterly. Each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Company on the date that is no later than one calendar year from the date of its issuance. The Series E Preferred Stock are also redeemable at the Company’s option, at percentages ranging from 115% to 125% for the first 180 days, based on the passage of time. The holders of Series E Preferred Stock rank senior to the Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents (as defined in the Series E Designation) with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation and will vote together with the holders of the Common Stock on an as-converted basis, subject to beneficial ownership limitations, on each matter submitted to a vote of holders of Common Stock (whether at a meeting of shareholders or by written consent). Based upon a subsequent financing, the holder has the option to exchange (in lieu of conversion), all or some of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock then held for any securities or units issued in a subsequent financing on a $1.00 for $1.00 basis. In the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the holder has the option to request that the Company or the successor entity shall purchase the Preferred Stock from the Holder on the date of such request by paying to the Holder cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes value. Upon any triggering event, including a change in control or the Company shall fail to have available a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stock to issue to such holder upon a conversion, each holder shall have the right, exercisable at the sole option of such holder, to require the Company to redeem all of the Series E Preferred Stock then held by such holder for a redemption price, in cash, equal to the Triggering Redemption Amount (150% of the Stated Value and all accrued but unpaid dividends and all liquidated damages, late fees and other costs), and increase the dividend rate on all of the outstanding Preferred Stock held by such Holder to 18% per annum thereafter. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the holders shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company an amount equal to the stated value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing for each share of Preferred Stock, before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Securities, and if the assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to pay in full such amounts, then the entire assets to be distributed to the holders shall be ratably distributed among the holders in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.
On April 14, 2021, the Company, entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with a holder of the Series D Preferred Stock, whereby, at the closing of the Offering, the Holder agreed to exchange an aggregate of 3,600 shares of the Company’s Series D Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series D Preferred Stock”) into 3,739.63 shares of the Company’s Series E Convertible Preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Series E Preferred Stock”). The Company analyzed the conversion feature of the Series E Preferred Stock issued on April 14, 2021, under ASC 470-20, “Debt with conversion and other options”, and based on the market price of the common stock of the Company on the dates of funding as compared to the conversion price, determined there was a beneficial conversion feature of approximately $3,270.000 to recognize, which will be amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the total Series E Preferred Stock BCF amortization, including the November 22, 2021, SPA, was $3,326,172.
On November 22, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (“SPA”) for 1,500 shares of the Company’s Series E Preferred Stock, at a price of $1,000 per share and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, with an exercise price equal to $0.75, which expires in five years, for a purchase price of $1,500,000. The warrant has a fair value of $561,000, estimated using the Black Scholes Model. The Company also issued 267,429 warrants as placement agent fees, with a fair value of $101,000, estimated with the same assumptions. All of the warrants were classified as a liability, as it is not known if there will be sufficient authorized shares to be issued upon settlement, based on the conversion terms of the convertible debt. The Company analyzed the conversion feature under ASC 470-20, “Debt with conversion and other options”, and based on the market price of the common stock of the Company on the dates of funding as compared to the conversion price, determined there was a beneficial conversion feature of approximately $170.000 to recognize, which will be amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method. The Company will accrete the carrying value, reflecting the discount of $300,000 between the stated value and purchase price and the fair value of the warrants issued of $662,000, of the Series E Preferred Stock in temporary equity up to the redemption value over the period until its redemption.
During the year ended March 31, 2022, 2,400 shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into 8,228,572 shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2022, there are 2,840 shares of Series E Preferred Stock outstanding.
Series F Preferred Stock
On February 22, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized Series F Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock have a par value of $0.0001. The Series F Designation authorized the issuance of up to 750,000 shares of the Company’s Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. At any time after the three year anniversary of the issuance of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock (the “Issuance Date”), each individual holder shall have the right, at each individual holder’s sole option, to convert all of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock that such individual holds into shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock in an amount equal to 8% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Each individual holder of Series F Preferred Stock may only convert all of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock in one transaction. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Company each holder of outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock will cast 1,000 votes per each share of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holder. The holders are not entitled to receive dividends, nor are they entitled to receive any distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding down of the Company, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The Company determined that the conversion feature was not required to be bifurcated as the conversion provision was determined to be clearly and closely related to the Series F Preferred Stock host instrument.
In the case of any capital reorganization, any reclassification of the stock of the Company, or a Change in Control, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall, at the effective time of such reorganization, reclassification, or Change in Control, be automatically converted into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company or of the entity resulting from such reorganization, reclassification, or Change in Control to which such holder would have been entitled if immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or Change in Control it had converted its shares of Series F Preferred Stock into common stock.
On March 1, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company issued 250,00 shares of Series F Preferred Stock to each of Gerald Easterling, William Delgado and Thomas Untermeyer in consideration for their past and future services as executive officers of the Company, for a total of 750,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock. The fair value of the stock compensation has been recognized based on the estimated value of the instruments the Company would be obligated to provide to the holders upon conversion to common shares, which for all three Series F PS holders would reflect 24% of the fair value of the outstanding common shares as of the grant date of March 1, 2022. Based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock plus shares payable, of 738,687,135, and the market value of the common stock of $0.246 on that date, the total stock compensation was $43,612,000. In accordance with ASC 718, as the shares are fully vested on the grant date, as well as all services required to be provided have occurred, the stock compensation was immediately recognized.
Going Concern
The audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared, assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated losses through the period to March 31, 2022 of approximately $150 million, as well as negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately $13 million. Presently, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources to meet its plans in the twelve months following the date of issuance of this filing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives in order to finance the continued build-out of our equipment and for general and administrative expenses. These alternatives include raising funds through public or private equity markets and either through institutional or retail investors. Although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful with our fund-raising initiatives, management believes that the Company will be able to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing financing discussions with third party investors and existing shareholders.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights, preferences and privileges of the Company’s common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations.
Future Financing
We will require additional funds to implement our growth strategy for our business. In addition, while we have received capital from various private placements that have enabled us to fund our operations, these funds have been largely used to develop our processes, although additional funds are needed for other corporate operational and working capital purposes. However, not including funds needed for capital expenditures or to pay down existing debt and trade payables, we anticipate that we will need to raise an additional $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 to cover all of our operational expenses over the next 12 months, not including any capital expenditures needed as part of any commercial scale-up of our equipment. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional necessary financing on a timely basis, or if we are unable to generate significant revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due, and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
Fair Value Measurement
The fair value measurement guidance clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in the valuation of an asset or liability. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the fair value measurement guidance are described below:
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or
Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
The Company did not have any Level 1 or Level 2 assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.
The Derivative and Warrant liabilities are Level 3 fair value measurements.
Basic and Diluted Earnings/Loss per Common Share
Basic and diluted earnings or loss per share (“EPS”) amounts in the consolidated financial statements are computed in accordance with ASC 260 - 10 “Earnings per Share”, which establishes the requirements for presenting EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (denominator) during the period. For the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which would be converted at the holder’s option into approximately 674,832,000 underlying common shares, 2,840 shares of Series E Redeemable Convertible Preferred shares with approximately 9,737,000 underlying shares of common stock that are convertible at the investors’ option at a fixed conversion price of $0.35, 750,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock which would be converted at the holders’ option into approximately 162,080,000 underlying common shares, and approximately $18,768,000 in a convertible debenture with approximately 98,779,000 underlying shares of common stock that are convertible at the holders’ option at conversion price of 90% of the average of the two lowest market prices over the last 10 days and 18,506,429 warrants outstanding which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which would be converted at the holder’s option into approximately 560,745,000 underlying common shares, 607 shares of Series B Preferred shares with approximately 1,202,000 underlying shares of common stock that are convertible at the investors’ option at a conversion price based on the lowest market price over the last 20 trading days, and 6,050 of shares of Series D Preferred shares with approximately 60,050,000 underlying shares of common stock that are convertible at the investors’ option at a fixed conversion price of $0.10, which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Long-lived Assets
The Company will periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review and at least annually. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that the fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires entities to account for beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock; (2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that are both indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity, by removing certain criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, to require entities to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2020-06 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
As of March 31, 2022, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
