Going Concern Uncertainty
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company generated net losses of $4,826,320 and $275,842 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $10,120,885. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $3,658,846 of cash.
We will require additional funding to finance the growth of our operations and achieve our strategic objectives. These factors, as relative to capital raising activities, create doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We are seeking to raise additional capital and are targeting strategic partners in an effort to accelerate the sales and marketing of our products and begin generating revenues. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of future capital offerings or alternative financing arrangements, expansion of our operations and generating sales. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing additional sources of financing sufficient to generate enough cash flow to fund its operations; however, management cannot make any assurances that such financing will be secured.

Factors That May Affect Future Results
Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains information based on management’s beliefs and forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, our ability to obtain the equity funding or borrowings necessary to market and launch our products, our ability to successfully serially produce and market our products; our success establishing and maintaining collaborative licensing and supplier arrangements; the acceptance of our products by customers; our continued ability to pay operating costs; our ability to meet demand for our products; the amount and nature of competition from our competitors; the effects of technological changes on products and product demand; and our ability to successfully adapt to market forces and technological demands of our customers.
