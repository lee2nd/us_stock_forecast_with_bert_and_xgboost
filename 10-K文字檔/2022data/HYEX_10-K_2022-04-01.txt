ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.

Overview
BergaMet NA, LLC
On February 4, 2019, we issued and exchanged shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding equity securities of BergaMet. BergaMet is an established company that was already generating revenues when we acquired it.
Ultimate Brain Nutrients, LLC
On April 3, 2020, we issued and exchanged shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding equity securities of UBN. UBN is a science-based company that develops unique, plant-based health technology neuro-products that provide natural brain solutions. UBN has numerous proprietary products, with four unique patent-pending formulations and two patents issued.
Going Concern
As a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. From inception (December 19, 2014) through the end of December 31, 2021, we have incurred accumulated net losses of $14,943,620. In order to continue as a going concern we must effectively balance many factors and generate more revenue so that we can fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, we have an immediate cash need, and thus we must raise capital by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. However, there is no assurance that our existing cash flow will be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Introduction
We had revenues of $1,465,782 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,276,559 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $377,200, or 29%. Our cost of revenue was $770,704 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,855,001 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,084,297, or 58%. Our cost of revenue exceeded revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 because we built up our inventory of bergamot product.
Revenues and Net Operating Loss
Our revenues, operating expenses, and net operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Revenues
We had revenues of $1,465,782 and $1,276,559 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 29%. The increase in revenues was main due to our increased focus on the Amazon marketplace.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue was $770,704 and $1,855,001 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 58%, and consisted of wholesale product costs and packaging. Our cost of revenue exceeded revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 because we built up our inventory of bergamot product.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense was $2,584,256 and $1,474,891 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, an increase of $1,109,365, or 75%. The increase was related to the additional costs of fund raising and the increased administrative costs associated with being a public company. In the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses consisted mainly of consulting of $1,010,902, selling expenses of $560,883, accounting and legal fees of $323,658, salary and wages of $147,938, and transfer agent and filing fees of $46,778.

Net Operating Gain/Loss
As a result of the items discussed above, our net operating loss was $1,889,177 and $3,633,216 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a reduction of $1,744,039.
Other Income and Expense
Other income (expense) was $(97,945) and $1,056,841 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $1,154,786, of which $1,138,512 was a change in fair value of derivative.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2021 was $222,098. Our monthly cash flow burn rate in 2021 (not including inventory purchases) was approximately $37,000. Although we have strong short term cash needs, as our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the issuance of debt or the sale of our securities until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs. With the acquisitions of BergaMet and UBN, we expected to see an increase in revenues that would help us maintain the cash we need to operate our business. However, we have incurred additional expenses in these acquisitions and the additional costs to be incurred through this expansion of our operations will increase our need for additional cash flow.
Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
Our cash increased by $162,897 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. Our total current assets decreased by $176,754, despite our increase in cash and accounts receivable as a result of our decrease in inventory. Our total assets decreased by $85,850 despite our increase in cash, accounts receivable, and patents/trademarks from the UBN acquisition.
Our current and total liabilities increased by $297,237, from $261,604 as of December 31, 2020 to $558,841 as of December 31, 2021. Our total liabilities as of the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of notes payable - related party of $170,866 and convertible debt of $171,750.
In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.
Cash Requirements
Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2021 was $222,098. Our monthly cash flow burn rate in 2021 (not including inventory purchases) was approximately $37,000. Although we have strong short term cash needs, as our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the sale of our securities until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.
Management considers the following policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Our management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. Our management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
