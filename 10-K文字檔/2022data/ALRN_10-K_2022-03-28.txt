Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a clinical stage chemoprotection oncology company focused on developing medicines to make chemotherapy safer and thereby more effective to save more patients’ lives. ALRN-6924, Aileron’s first-in-class MDM2/MDMX dual inhibitor, is designed to activate p53, which in turn upregulates p21, a known inhibitor of the cell replication cycle. ALRN-6924 is the only reported chemoprotective agent in clinical development to employ a biomarker strategy, which exclusively focuses on treating patients with p53-mutated cancers. Aileron’s targeted strategy is designed to selectively protect multiple healthy cell types throughout the body from chemotherapy without protecting cancer cells. As a result, healthy cells are spared from chemotherapeutic destruction while chemotherapy continues to kill cancer cells. By reducing or eliminating multiple chemotherapy-induced side effects, ALRN-6924 may improve patients’ quality of life and help them better tolerate chemotherapy. Enhanced tolerability may result in fewer dose reductions or delays of chemotherapy and the potential for improved efficacy. Aileron’s vision is to bring chemoprotection against multiple toxicities to all patients with p53-mutated cancer regardless of type of cancer or chemotherapy.
Our clinical development program for ALRN-6924 as a selective chemoprotective agent includes:
•Our completed Phase 1b open-label clinical trial evaluating ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent in patients with p53-mutated small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, undergoing treatment with second-line topotecan;
•Our Phase 1 pharmacology study of ALRN-6924 in healthy volunteers, the aim of which is to develop universal dosing regimen for ALRN-6924 across a range of chemotherapies and p53-mutated cancers;
•Our ongoing Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent in patients with p53-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, undergoing treatment with first-line carboplatin plus pemetrexed with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors;
•A planned Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent in patients with p53-mutated ER+/HER2- breast cancer with a doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide and docetaxel chemotherapy regimen.
Subject to obtaining additional funding, we plan to expand our clinical program to evaluate ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent, across additional p53-mutated tumor types and chemotherapy regimens.
Since our inception, we have devoted a substantial portion of our resources to developing our product candidates, including ALRN-6924, developing our proprietary stabilized cell-permeating peptide platform, building our intellectual property portfolio, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
To date, we have financed operations primarily through $145.5 million in net proceeds from sales of common stock, $131.2 million from sales of preferred stock prior to our IPO, and $34.9 million from a collaboration agreement in 2010.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses on an aggregate basis. Our net losses were $26.2 million and $21.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $245.5 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities, licensing and patent investment and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years.
As a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2023. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements, or other sources of capital. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Market conditions are volatile and may continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future, which may limit our ability to raise capital. In addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of ALRN-6924 for one or more indications, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for ALRN-6924 for such indications on suitable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate some or all of our clinical and drug development programs and future commercialization efforts. We may also be forced to take other actions that could adversely affect our business.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
We believe that, based on our current operating plan, our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $45.9 million as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the fourth quarter of 2023. Our funding estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. In any event, our cash, cash equivalents and investments will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development or commercialization of ALRN-6924, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.
COVID-19
In March 2020, we began precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and partners and prospective clinical trial participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because millions of COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States and worldwide, certain national, state and local governmental authorities have issued orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, more restrictive orders, proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, the conduct of our clinical studies with our external partners has been adjusted to institute virtual clinical trial site training and site monitoring, along with partnering with sites to minimize patient visits and institute telemedicine to minimize patient exposure. We have enrolled, and are seeking to enroll, cancer patients in our clinical trials at sites located both in the United States and Europe, which are areas that continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, site activation and patient enrollment have been disrupted, particularly in our trial sites located in Eastern Europe.
In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our ability to activate clinical trial sites and resulted in slower-than-anticipated enrollment in our Phase 1b clinical trial of ALRN-6924 in patients with advanced p53-mutated NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is unknown and will depend on future developments. Such future events are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the new variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 that have been identified and are spreading in the United States and around the world, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments or we may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced patient traffic and reduced operations. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 will determine whether the pandemic will continue to have an impact on our business, including our clinical trials. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Components of our Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties.
Operating Expenses
Our expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.
We expect that our operating expenses will increase if and as we increase our level of clinical development of ALRN-6924 and hire additional personnel to carry out such clinical development.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of ALRN-6924, and include:
•expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture ALRN-6924 for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;
•salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•third-party license fees;
•costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
Our employee and infrastructure resources are primarily devoted to the development of ALRN-6924. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.
We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs and milestone payments made under our licensing arrangements by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, license payments made under our licensing arrangements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses in the foreseeable future as we continue our ongoing clinical trials of ALRN-6924, initiate additional clinical trials of ALRN-6924 and pursue later stages of clinical development of ALRN-6924.
We cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of the current or future clinical trials of ALRN-6924 or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of ALRN-6924 will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trial of ALRN-6924, as well as of any future clinical trials of ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop and other research and development activities that we may conduct;
•uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;
•significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;
•the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and
•the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance and corporate and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses are comprised of professional fees associated with being a public company including costs of accounting, auditing, legal, regulatory, tax and consulting services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs; and both public and investor relations costs. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; other insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Historically, our interest income had not been significant due to low investment balances and low interest earned on those balances. We anticipate that our interest income will fluctuate in the future in response to our cash, cash equivalents and investments, and the interest rate environment.
Other Income, net
Other income, net consists of gains or losses recognized from non-routine items such as debt forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program and gains or losses recognized from the disposal of fixed assets.
Income Taxes
Since our inception in 2001, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in any year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $228.2 million and $221.7 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2029 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2025. The Company also has federal orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of $1.6 million which begin to expire in 2039.
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. We have not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. If we have experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of our common stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contract and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•CROs in connection with performing research activities on our behalf and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;
•investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials;
•vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in thousands:
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $17.0 million, compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $5.8 million was primarily due to increased costs associated with conducting our Phase 1b clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer, partially offset by decreased facility related costs of $0.8 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $0.3 million in general and administrative expense was primarily a result of a $0.8 increase in employee expenses due to increased headcount, offset by decreased facilities cost resulting from the relocation of our corporate headquarters.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of income from the forgiveness for the Payroll Protection Program loan of $0.3 million, and a gain on sale of fixed assets of $0.1 million.
Other expense, net of $0.7 for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $0.1 million and is offset by a non-cash derecognition charge of our former corporate headquarters of $0.8 million. On November 11, 2020, we entered into a lease termination agreement with respect to our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts. In connection with the lease termination we derecognized our right of use assets and operating lease liabilities associated with the lease. The derecognition of these assets and liabilities resulted in a non-cash charge of $0.8 million. We anticipate that our interest income will fluctuate in the future in response to our level of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and then current interest rates.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses on an aggregate basis. We have not yet commercialized any product candidate, including ALRN-6924, which is in clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. We have financed our operations through sales of common stock in our initial public offering and follow-on public offerings, sales of common stock and warrants in a private placement, sales of common stock in “at-the-market” offerings, sales of common stock under our equity line with Lincoln Park Capital LLC, or LPC, sales of preferred stock prior to our initial public offering and payments received under a collaboration agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $45.9 million.
Public Offerings
In June 2020, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 10,162,059 shares of common stock, including an additional 1,071,149 shares of common stock upon the partial exercise of the option of the underwriter to purchase additional shares of common stock, for a purchase price to the public of $1.10 per share. We received aggregate gross proceeds from the public offering of approximately $11.2 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $0.9 million.
In January 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 32,630,983 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering at a purchase price per share of $1.10. The aggregate gross proceeds of the registered direct offering were $35.9 million, before deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by us of approximately $2.9 million.
At-the-Market Offering
In July 2019, we entered into a Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, or JonesTrading, under which we were able to issue and sell shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15.0 million, or the Prior Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,160,899 shares of common stock pursuant to the Prior Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $4.0 million, before deducting commissions and fees. Between January 1, 2021 and January 28, 2021, we sold an additional 7,174,993 shares of common stock pursuant to the Prior Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $9.7 million, before deducting commissions and fees. We terminated the Prior Sales Agreement in January 2021.
In January 2021, we entered into a Capital on Demand Sales Agreement, or the ATM Sales Agreement, with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, or JonesTrading, and William Blair & Company, L.L.C., or William Blair, as agents, under which we may issue and sell shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million. Sales of common stock through JonesTrading and William Blair may be made by any method that is deemed an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,225,406 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement for proceeds of $10.6 million, after deducting commissions and fees.
Equity Line Financing
On September 21, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with LPC for an equity line financing. The Purchase Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC, and LPC is obligated to purchase up to $15.0 million of shares of common stock at our sole discretion, over a 36-month period that commenced in October 2020. We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 covering the sale of shares of common stock that are issued to LPC under the Purchase Agreement, which was declared effective on October 15, 2020.
Upon entering into the Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold 367,647 shares of common stock, or the Initial Purchase Shares, to LPC at a price per share of $1.36, or $0.5 million, which is part of the $15.0 million of shares of common stock that we may sell to LPC under the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, we issued to LPC as a commitment fee 220,588 shares of common stock as consideration for LPC entering into the Purchase Agreement.
Under the Purchase Agreement, we may, at our discretion, direct LPC to purchase on any single business day, or a Regular Purchase, up to (i) 250,000 shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common stock is not below $1.50 per share on Nasdaq, (ii) 200,000 shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common stock is not below $1.00 per share on Nasdaq or (iii) 150,000 shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common stock is below $1.00 per share on Nasdaq. In any case, LPC’s commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $1,000,000.
The purchase price per share for each such Regular Purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of our common stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the Purchase Agreement. Under the Purchase Agreement, we may not effect any sales of shares of common stock on any purchase date that the closing sale price of our common stock on Nasdaq is less than the floor price of $0.30 per share.
In addition to Regular Purchases, we may also direct LPC to purchase other amounts as accelerated purchases or as additional accelerated purchases on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to us will depend on the frequency of sales and the number of shares sold to LPC and prices at which we sell shares to LPC.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and termination provisions. LPC has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our common stock. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financings (other than restrictions on our ability to enter into additional “equity line” or a substantially similar transaction whereby a specific investor is irrevocably bound pursuant to an agreement with us to purchase securities over a period of time from us at a price based on the market price of the common stock at the time of such purchase), rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our sole discretion, without any cost or penalty. During any “event of default” under the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park does not have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement; however, we may not initiate any purchase of shares by LPC until such event of default is cured. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,417,647 shares of common stock to LPC for gross proceeds of $1,801 million. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,375,000 shares of common stock to LPC for gross proceeds of $2.6 million.
Private Placement
On April 2, 2019, we issued and sold in a private placement an aggregate of (i) 11,838,582 units, consisting of 11,838,582 shares of its common stock and associated warrants, or the common warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 11,838,582 shares of common stock, for a combined price of $2.01 per unit and (ii) 1,096,741 units, consisting of (a) pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,096,741 shares of our common stock and (b) associated common warrants to purchase 1,096,741 shares of common stock, for a combined price of $2.01 per unit. The pre-funded warrants had an exercise price of $0.01 per share and had no expiration. The common warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and expire five years from the date of issuance. The securities were sold pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with accredited investors on March 28, 2019. We received aggregate gross proceeds from the private placement of approximately $26.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately $2.2 million and excluding the exercise of any warrants. In July 2019, all outstanding pre-funded warrants were exercised for 1,096,741 shares of common stock.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities used $23.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $26.2 million and cash provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.2 million offset by non-cash charges of $2.2 million. Non-cash charges resulted primarily from stock-based compensation expense. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of an increase of $1.0 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a decrease of $0.3 million in prepaid expense and other assets, and $0.4 million in accounts payable.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $20.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $21.2 million and cash provided by the change in operating assets of $1.3 million offset by non-cash charges of $2.0 million. Non-cash charges resulted primarily from stock-based compensation expense. The derecognition of our right-to-use lease assets and operating lease liabilities resulted in operating cash flow usage of $0.8 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a decrease of $1.7 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and an increase of $0.7 million in prepaid expense and other assets.
Investing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, investing activities used $35.9 million of cash. We received $37.8 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and $0.1 million from the sale of property and equipment offset by $73.6 million of purchases of investments.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, investing activities provided $6.4 million of cash. We received $16.2 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and $0.2 million from the sale of property and equipment offset by $10.0 million of purchases of investments.
Financing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $55.7 million due to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock in the first quarter of 2021.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $15.8 million due to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock in our public offering in June 2020, sales under our Prior Sales Agreement with JonesTrading, funds received from sales of common stock to LPC during 2020 and proceeds from the Paycheck Protection Program Loan of $0.4 million.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing development activities related to ALRN-6924, which is still in clinical development, and any other product candidates and programs that we may pursue in the future. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•conduct our current, planned and future clinical trials of ALRN-6924;
•initiate and resume research and preclinical and clinical development of any other product candidates that we may develop;
•seek to identify additional product candidates;
•seek marketing approvals for any product candidate that successfully completes clinical trials, if any;
•require the manufacture of larger quantities of ALRN-6924 for clinical development and potentially commercialization;
•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies;
•hire and retain additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•build out new facilities or expand existing facilities to support our ongoing development activity; and
•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development, any future commercialization efforts and our compliance with our obligations as a public company.
We believe that, based on our current operating plan, our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $45.9 million as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the fourth quarter of 2023. Our funding estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. In any event, our cash, cash equivalents and investments will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development or commercialization of ALRN-6924. Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.
Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements, or other sources of capital. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop on suitable terms, on a timely basis or at all.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of ALRN-6924 and other product candidates that we may develop and programs we may pursue, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of ALRN-6924 is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing, planned and future clinical trials of ALRN-6924;
•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations;
•the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical research and clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may develop;
•the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of ALRN-6924;
•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•the success of any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties;
•the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates, although we currently have no commitments or agreements to complete any such transactions;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any product candidate for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator that we may have at such time;
•the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of ALRN-6924, should ALRN-6924 receive marketing approval;
•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•our headcount growth and associated costs, as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and
•the costs of operating as a public company.
Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, ALRN-6924, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Other than the Purchase Agreement with LPC, which is subject to certain limitations and conditions, we do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Additional debt or preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
