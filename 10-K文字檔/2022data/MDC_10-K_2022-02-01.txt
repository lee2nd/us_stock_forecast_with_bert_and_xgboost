EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overview
Industry Conditions and Outlook for MDC*
The Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic began impacting the U.S. economy during the latter part of March 2020, adversely affecting consumer demand, financial markets and employment levels. The homebuilding industry was not immune to the impact of the pandemic as we experienced an industry-wide decrease in traffic and order activity as well as increased cancellation levels during the months of March and April 2020. As economic activity resumed and restrictive orders relating to COVID-19 were eased, demand for our homes improved significantly during the remainder of 2020. While we have seen a return of more normal seasonal patterns during 2021, demand has remained strong throughout the year, driven by an improving economy, low interest rates and a continued focus on suburban homeownership. We believe many of these factors will continue to support new home demand in future periods. In contrast, the supply of new and existing homes has remained constrained, due in large part to the underproduction of new homes over the past decade. As a result of this supply-demand imbalance, we raised sales prices in the majority of our communities throughout the year in order to (1) offset cost increases, which have been significant due to cost inflation and labor and material shortages; (2) improve the profitability per home closed given current demand and limits on construction capacity, and; (3) reduce our sales absorption rate to keep our backlog at a level that is manageable for our construction personnel and trade suppliers.
Like many within the industry, we continue to experience shortages of certain building materials and tightness in labor markets for a variety of reasons, including the current supply-demand imbalance and disruptions caused by the pandemic. These disruptions have caused both our construction and land development times to extend. For instance, our average sale-to-close cycle time during the fourth quarter of 2021 was over nine months as compared to our more typical build time of six to eight months. We do not expect material or labor conditions to significantly improve in the near term.
Despite these challenges, we achieved record levels of home sale revenues and consolidated net income for the full year ended December 31, 2021. Our backlog at December 31, 2021 was 7,640 homes with an estimated dollar value of $4.30 billion, up 15% and 32%, respectively, as compared to our backlog at December 31, 2020. This was our highest ever year-end backlog in both units and dollars. In addition, we approved over 20,000 lots for acquisition during the year, resulting in a 29% year-over-year increase in lots owned and optioned to approximately 38,000 lots as of year-end. These metrics bode well for our growth prospects, as does our strategic entry into the Boise, Nashville, Austin and Albuquerque markets during the year. Financial services pretax income reached record levels in 2021, driven largely by our mortgage operations, which has benefited from increased profitability per loan originated during 2020 and early 2021. As competition in the primary mortgage market has increased, we have seen these profit margins return to more historical levels. Overall, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor developments related to COVID-19, which are highly uncertain and could adversely and materially impact our operations and financial results in future periods.
We ended the year with total liquidity of $1.75 billion following the optional redemption in December 2021 of the remaining $126.4 million of our 5.500% senior notes, which were scheduled to mature in January 2024. This lowered our debt to capital ratio quarter-over-quarter to 36.5% as of December 31, 2021. We believe that our financial position ranks among the best in the homebuilding industry and provides us with the capital resources to drive the continued growth of our business.
Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported net income of $573.7 million, or $7.83 per diluted share, a 56% increase compared to net income of $367.6 million, or $5.17 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Both our homebuilding and financial services businesses contributed to these year-over-year improvements, as pretax income from our homebuilding operations increased $281.2 million, or 74%, and our financial services pretax income increased $13.0 million, or 16%. The increase in homebuilding pretax income was the result of a 330 basis point increase in our operating margin and a 36% increase in home sale revenues. These increases were partially offset by a loss on debt retirement of $23.6 million. The increase in operating margin is the result of our improved pricing over the last twelve months as well as better operating leverage as we continue to grow our homebuilding operations, partially offset by increased supply costs. The increase in financial services pretax income was primarily due to the overall increase in volume of our homebuilding operations. Additionally, $8.3 million of net losses on equity securities were recognized in the prior year period, further impacting the year-over-year increase in financial services pretax income.
The dollar value of our net new home orders increased 11% from the prior year, due to a 11% increase in the average selling price of orders. The increase in the average selling price was the result of price increases implemented over the past twelve months.
* See “Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Homebuilding
Pretax Income (Loss)
Homebuilding pretax income for 2021 was $659.7 million, an increase of $281.2 million from $378.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a 36% increase in home sale revenues, a 230 basis point improvement in gross margin from home sales and a 100 basis point decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Our West segment experienced a $233.4 million year-over-year increase in pretax income, due to a 41% increase in home sale revenues and an improved gross margin. Our Mountain segment experienced a $56.5 million increase in pretax income from the prior year, as a result of a 21% increase in home sale revenues and an improved gross margin. Our East segment experienced a $39.5 million increase in pretax income from the prior year, primarily due to a 56% increase in home sale revenues and an improved gross margin. Each of our homebuilding segments also benefited from decreased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue driven by improved operating leverage. Our Corporate segment experienced an $48.2 million increase in pretax loss, due to the $23.6 million loss on retirement of debt recognized in the current year, increased stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, increased payroll expense due to higher headcount and increased bonus expense.
Assets
Total homebuilding assets increased 30% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Increases in each of our homebuilding segments were the result of increases in our inventory balances. These increases were driven by an increase in homes completed or under construction as of period end and, with the exception of our Mountain segment, a greater number of lots acquired during the period than those delivered to homebuyers. The increase in our Corporate segment was due to the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes during the year. This increase was partially offset by the funding of land acquisitions and construction activity by our Corporate Segment as well as the retirement of our $250 million 5.500% senior notes, which were scheduled to mature in January 2024.
New Home Deliveries & Home Sale Revenues:
Changes in home sale revenues are impacted by changes in the number of new homes delivered and the average selling price of those delivered homes. Commentary for each of our segments on significant changes in these two metrics is provided below.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the number of new homes delivered in each of our segments was negatively impacted by an increase in construction cycle times. Our average sale-to-close cycle time during the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 36 weeks. Cycle times increased approximately five weeks year-over-year, from the year-ended December 31, 2020 to the year-ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily the result of extended permitting times, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages as a result of the pandemic as well as the increased demand for new homes.
West Segment Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in new home deliveries was the result of an increase in the number of homes in backlog to begin the year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in backlog conversion rates in most of our markets within this segment as a result of the increased construction cycle times discussed above. The average selling price of homes delivered increased as a result of price increases implemented over the last twelve months as well as a shift in geographic mix of homes delivered from Arizona to Southern California. These increases were partially offset by a shift in mix to lower priced communities.
Mountain Segment Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in new home deliveries was the result of an increase in the number of homes in backlog to begin the year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in backlog conversion rates as a result of the increased construction cycle times discussed above. The average selling price of homes delivered increased as a result of price increases implemented over the last twelve months.
East Segment Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in new home deliveries was the result of an increase in the number of homes in backlog to begin the year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in backlog conversion rates as a result of the increased construction cycle times discussed above. The average selling price of homes delivered increased as a result of price increases implemented over the last twelve months. Additionally, we experienced a shift in mix within several markets to higher priced communities.
Gross Margin
Our gross margin from home sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 230 basis points year-over-year from 20.8% to 23.1%. Gross margin from home sales increased across each of our segments driven by price increases implemented across nearly all of our communities over the past twelve months. Our gross margin from home sales was also positively impacted by a decrease in our capitalized interest in cost of sales as a percentage of home sale revenues. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in building material and labor costs year-over-year.
Inventory Impairments
Inventory impairments recognized by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the table below.
The table below provides quantitative data, for the periods presented, where applicable, used in determining the fair value of the impaired inventory.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (1) increased stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, (2) increased bonus expense and (3) increased salary related expenses due to higher average headcount.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, marketing expenses increased as a result of increased deferred selling amortization and master marketing fees resulting from increased closings.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, commissions expenses increased as a result of the increase in home sale revenues year-over-year.
Other Homebuilding Operating Data
Net New Orders and Active Subdivisions:
Changes in the dollar value of net new orders are impacted by changes in the number of net new orders and the average selling price of those homes. Commentary for each of our segments on significant changes in these two metrics is provided below
*Calculated as total net new orders in period ÷ average active communities during period ÷ number of months in period
West Segment Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in average selling price was due to price increases implemented over the past twelve months within nearly all of our communities. This increase was slightly offset by a shift in mix to lower priced communities.
Mountain Segment Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in net new orders was due to a decrease in average active subdivisions within our Colorado markets. The increase in average selling price was due to price increases implemented over the last twelve months within nearly all of our communities.
East Segment Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in net new orders was due to an increase in average active subdivisions within our Florida markets. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the monthly sales absorption rate. The increase in average selling price was due to price increases implemented over the last twelve months within nearly all of our communities. Additionally, we experienced a shift in mix within several markets to higher priced communities.
Cancellation Rate:
Our cancellations as a percentage of gross sales (“cancellation rate”) decreased from 19% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the higher cancellation rates incurred during the first and second quarter of 2020 as a result of general economic uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.
Consistent with our quarterly homebuilding operating data provided, we have also included below the cancellations as a percentage of homes in beginning backlog for each quarter during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Backlog:
At December 31, 2021, we had 7,640 homes in backlog with a total value of $4.30 billion, representing respective increases of 15% and 32% from December 31, 2020. The increase in the number of homes in backlog is primarily a result of an increase in cycle times within nearly all of our markets. The increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog is due to price increases implemented over the past twelve months in nearly all of our communities as well as a shift in our net new order mix in our East segment as discussed above. Our ability to convert backlog into closings could be adversely and materially impacted in future periods by the pandemic, the extent to which is highly uncertain and depends on future developments.
Homes Completed or Under Construction:
The increase in sold homes under construction or completed is due to the year-over-year increase in the number of homes in backlog noted above as well as a 1,100 basis point decrease year-over-year in the number of homes in backlog that were sold but where construction had not yet started as of period end.
Lots Owned and Optioned (including homes completed or under construction):
Our total owned and optioned lots at December 31, 2021 were 38,080, up 29% from December 31, 2020. We believe that our total lot supply can support growth in future periods. See "Forward-Looking Statements" above.
Financial Services
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our financial services revenues increased $16.4 million, or 12% from the same period in the previous year. The increase was due to our other financial services segment, which saw an increase in revenue of $10.5 million. This increase was the result of increased volume during 2021. The increase in our mortgage operations segment was $5.9 million. This increase was the result of increased homebuilding volume, mostly offset by increased competition in the primary mortgage market.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our financial services pretax income increased $13.0 million or 16% from the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to our other financial services segment, which saw an increase in pretax income of $14.6 million. This increase was the result of $8.3 million of net losses on equity securities recognized during the prior year period and to a lesser extent the increase in volume of our homebuilding operations. The decrease to our mortgage
operations was due to increased compensation related costs, partially offset by a $3.5 million gain recognized on the sale of conventional mortgage servicing rights during the period and increased homebuilding volume.
The table below sets forth information for our mortgage operations relating to mortgage loans originated and capture rate.
Income Taxes
We recorded an income tax provision of $178.0 million, $89.9 million and $66.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and our resulting effective income tax rates were 23.7%, 19.7% and 21.9%, respectively. Our tax provision and effective tax rate is driven by (i) pre-tax book income for the full year, adjusted for items that are deductible/non-deductible for tax purposes only (i.e., permanent items); (ii) benefits from federal energy credits; (iii) taxable income generated in state jurisdictions that varies from consolidated income and (iv) stock based compensation windfalls recorded as discrete items. The difference between our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the federal statutory rate was primarily due to 3.5% in state taxes and 2.0% for limitations on deductible executive compensation, partially offset by (1.9)% in benefits for federal energy credits and (0.5)% in benefits for the reversal of uncertain tax positions related to expiration of statutory limitations.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We use our liquidity and capital resources to (1) support our operations, including the purchase of land, land development and construction of homes; (2) provide working capital; and (3) provide mortgage loans for our homebuyers. Our liquidity includes our cash and cash equivalents, Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and Mortgage Repurchase Facility (as defined below). Additionally, we have an existing effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue equity, debt or hybrid securities up to $2.0 billion, of which $1.0 billion remains.
Material Cash Requirements
We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, payments due on our Mortgage Repurchase Facility, purchase obligations related to expected acquisition of land under purchase agreements and land development agreements (many of which are secured by letters of credit or surety bonds) and operating leases. Other material cash requirements include land acquisition and development costs not yet contracted for, home construction costs, operating expenses, including our selling, general and administrative expenses, investments and funding of capital improvements and dividend payments.
At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding senior notes with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, with none payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the notes total $1.4 billion, with $64.2 million payable within 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, we had $34.7 million of required operating lease future minimum payments.
At December 31, 2021, we had deposits of $41.6 million in the form of cash and $19.6 million in the form of letters of credit that secured option contracts to purchase 11,148 lots for a total estimated purchase price of $1.0 billion.
At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $371.3 million and $215.5 million, respectively, including $175.4 million in letters of credit issued by HomeAmerican. The estimated cost to complete obligations related to these bonds and letters of credit were approximately $201.7 million and $161.6 million, respectively. We expect that the obligations secured by these performance bonds and letters of credit generally will be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. To the extent that the obligations are performed, the related performance bonds and letters of credit should be released and we should not have any continuing obligations. However, in the event any such performance bonds or letters of credit are called, our indemnity obligations could require us to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond or letter of credit. We have made no material guarantees with respect to third-party obligations.
Capital Resources
Our capital structure is primarily a combination of (1) permanent financing, represented by stockholders’ equity; (2) long-term financing, represented by our 3.850% senior notes due 2030, 2.500% senior notes due 2031, 6.000% senior notes due 2043, and 3.966% senior notes due 2061; (3) our Revolving Credit Facility and (4) our Mortgage Repurchase Facility. During the year-ended December 31, 2021, we accelerated the retirement of all of our $250 million 5.500% senior notes, which were scheduled to mature in January 2024 (see Note 16, Lines of Credit and Total Debt Obligations, in the notes to the financial statements for further discussion). Because of our current balance of cash, cash equivalents, ability to access the capital markets, and available capacity under both our Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility, we believe that our capital resources are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term capital requirements, including meeting future payments on our senior notes as they become due. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes through cash purchases, whether through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Senior Notes, Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility
Senior Notes. Our senior notes are not secured and, while the senior note indentures contain some restrictions on secured debt and other transactions, they do not contain financial covenants. Our senior notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. We believe that we are in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in the senior note indentures.
Revolving Credit Facility. We have an unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a group of lenders, which may be used for general corporate purposes. This agreement was amended on December 28, 2020 to (1) increase the aggregate commitment from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion (the "Commitment"), (2) extend the Revolving Credit Facility maturity of $1.125 billion of the Commitments to December 18, 2025 with the remaining Commitment continuing to terminate on December 18, 2023 and (3) provide that the aggregate amount of the commitments may increase to an amount not to exceed $1.7 billion upon our request, subject to receipt of additional commitments from existing or additional lenders and, in the case of additional lenders, the consent of the co-administrative agents. As defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, interest rates on base rate borrowings are equal to the highest of (1) 0.0%, (2) a prime rate, (3) a federal funds effective rate plus 1.50%, and (4) a specified eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% and, in each case, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. Interest rates on eurocurrency borrowings are equal to a specified eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At any time at which our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, exceeds 55%, the aggregate principal amount of all consolidated senior debt borrowings outstanding may not exceed the borrowing base. There is no borrowing base requirement if our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, is 55% or less.
The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a transition from the eurocurrency rate to a benchmark replacement upon the occurrence of certain events.
The Revolving Credit Facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. The facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The financial covenants include a consolidated tangible net worth test and a leverage test, along with a consolidated tangible net worth covenant, all as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. A failure to satisfy the foregoing tests does not constitute an event of default, but can trigger a “term-out” of the facility. A breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant (but not the consolidated tangible net worth test) or a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws would result in an event of default.
The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant, a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws, failure to make timely payments, breaches of certain representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, or another person becoming beneficial owner of 50% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe we were in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $10.0 million in borrowings and $40.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving remaining borrowing capacity of $1.15 billion.
Mortgage Repurchase Facility. HomeAmerican has a Master Repurchase Agreement (the “Mortgage Repurchase Facility”) with U.S. Bank National Association (“USBNA”). The Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides liquidity to HomeAmerican by providing for the sale of up to an aggregate of $75 million (subject to increase by up to $75 million under certain conditions) of eligible mortgage loans to USBNA with an agreement by HomeAmerican to repurchase the mortgage loans at a future date. Until such mortgage loans are transferred back to HomeAmerican, the documents relating to such loans are held by USBNA, as custodian, pursuant to the Custody Agreement (“Custody Agreement”), dated as of November 12, 2008, by and between HomeAmerican and USBNA. In the event that an eligible mortgage loan becomes ineligible, as defined under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility, HomeAmerican may be required to repurchase the ineligible mortgage loan immediately. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility was amended on September 24, 2020, March 25, 2021, May 20, 2021, and December 21, 2021 to adjust the commitments to purchase for specific time periods. As part of the amendments, the commitments to purchase (subject to increase by up to $75 million under certain conditions) were increased as follows: (1) $200 million for the periods December 22, 2020 through February 4, 2021, (2) $175 million for the periods March 25, 2021 through April 22, 2021, June 23, 2021 through July 22, 2021, September 22, 2021 through October 21, 2021, and March 23, 2022 through April 21, 2022 and (3) $400 million for the period December 21, 2021 through February 15, 2022. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility is scheduled to terminate on May 19, 2022.
The maximum aggregate commitment of the Mortgage Repurchase Facility was not temporarily increased as of December 31, 2021. The maximum aggregate commitment of the Mortgage Repurchase Facility was temporarily increased by $50 million on December 28, 2020 effective through January 27, 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, HomeAmerican had $256.3 million and $202.4 million, respectively, of mortgage loans that HomeAmerican was obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. Mortgage loans that HomeAmerican is obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase
Facility are accounted for as a debt financing arrangement and are reported as mortgage repurchase facility in the consolidated balance sheets. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility was amended on December 21, 2021 to provide for a transition from a pricing rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to one based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).
The Mortgage Repurchase Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include, among others, (i) a minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth requirement, (ii) a maximum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth ratio, (iii) a minimum adjusted net income requirement, and (iv) a minimum Liquidity requirement. The foregoing capitalized terms are defined in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. We believe HomeAmerican was in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of December 31, 2021.
Dividends
In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we paid dividends of $1.67 per share and $1.29 per share, respectively. In addition to the cash dividends paid, the Company distributed a stock dividend of 8% during 2021.
MDC Common Stock Repurchase Program
At December 31, 2021, we were authorized to repurchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Consolidated Cash Flow
Our operating cash flows are primarily impacted by: (1) land purchases and construction of homes; (2) closing homes and the associated timing of collecting receivables from home closings; (3) sales of mortgage loans originated by HomeAmerican; (4) payments on accounts payables and accrued liabilities; and (5) funding for payroll. When we close on the sale of a house, our homebuilding subsidiaries will generally receive the proceeds from the sale of the homes within a few days of the home being closed. Therefore, our home sales receivable balance can increase or decrease from period to period based upon the timing of our home closings. Additionally, the amount of mortgage loans held-for-sale can be impacted period to period based upon the number of mortgage loans that were originated by HomeAmerican that have not been sold to third party purchasers and by the timing of fundings by third party mortgage purchasers. Accordingly, mortgage loans held-for-sale may increase if HomeAmerican originates more homes towards the end of one reporting period when compared with the same period in the previous year. HomeAmerican will generally sell mortgage loans it originates between 5 to 35 days after origination.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $208.0 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $23.1 million in the prior year. Cash used to increase housing completed or under construction was $431.9 million and $449.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as our homes in inventory increased significantly during both periods. During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used to increase land and land under development was $497.4 million compared to $15.0 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by the acquisition of 15,435 lots during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 11,195 lots during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used because of an increase in trade and other receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $25.3 million and $12.8 million, respectively, due to the year-over-year increases in home deliveries during both periods. Cash provided by the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $126.4 million and $91.3 million, respectively, due to the increased construction spend during both periods as a result of the year-over-year increases in home deliveries as well as the increase in homes in inventory at both period ends. The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $27.7 million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $21.7 million in the prior year. The primary driver of this increase in cash from investing activities relates to $48.5 million in net cash provided by the sale of marketable securities during the prior year. Cash used to purchase property and equipment remained materially consistent year-over-year.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $335.2 million compared with $31.2 million in the prior year. The primary driver of this increase in cash provided by financing activities is the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $694.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which was partially offset by $277.0 million used to accelerate the retirement of our unsecured notes scheduled to mature in January 2024. Net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes was $48.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used to fund dividend payments increased year-over year as a result of the 25% increase in the cash dividend declared in October 2021 and the 8% stock dividend declared in January 2021.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates such estimates and judgments on an on-going basis and makes adjustments as deemed necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates if conditions are significantly different in the future. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Listed below are those estimates and policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. Our critical accounting estimates and policies are as follows and should be read in conjunction with the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Homebuilding Inventory Valuation. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the financial statements for information on the composition of the inventory balances.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”), homebuilding inventories, excluding those classified as held for sale, are carried at cost unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the underlying subdivision may not be recoverable. We evaluate inventories for impairment at each quarter end on a subdivision level basis as each such subdivision represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. In making this determination, we review, among other things, the following for each subdivision:
•actual and trending “Operating Margin” (which is defined as home sale revenues less home cost of sales and all incremental costs associated directly with the subdivision, including sales commissions and marketing costs);
•estimated future undiscounted cash flows and Operating Margin;
•forecasted Operating Margin for homes in backlog;
•actual and trending net home orders;
•homes available for sale;
•market information for each sub-market, including competition levels, home foreclosure levels, the size and style of homes currently being offered for sale and lot size; and
•known or probable events indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our inventory may not be recoverable, assets are reviewed for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from an individual subdivision (including capitalized interest) to its carrying value. We generally determine the estimated fair value of each subdivision by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using discount rates, which are Level 3 inputs (see Note 6, Fair Value Measurements, in the notes to the financial statements for definitions of fair value inputs), that are commensurate with the risk of the subdivision under evaluation. The evaluation for the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets for each individual subdivision can be impacted significantly by our estimates of future home sale revenues, home construction costs, and development costs per home, all of which are Level 3 inputs. These estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are dependent on specific market or sub-market conditions for each subdivision. While we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a reporting period, these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change. Local market-specific conditions that may impact these estimates for a subdivision include:
•historical subdivision results, and actual and trending Operating Margin, base selling prices and home sales incentives;
•forecasted Operating Margin for homes in backlog;
•the intensity of competition within a market or sub-market, including publicly available home sales prices and home sales incentives offered by our competitors;
•increased levels of home foreclosures;
•the current sales pace for active subdivisions;
•subdivision specific attributes, such as location, availability and size of lots in the sub-market, desirability and uniqueness of subdivision location and the size and style of homes currently being offered;
•potential for alternative home styles to respond to local market conditions;
•changes by management in the sales strategy of a given subdivision; and
•current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts.
These and other local market-specific conditions that may be present are considered by personnel in our homebuilding divisions as they prepare or update the forecasted assumptions for each subdivision. Quantitative and qualitative factors other than home sales prices could significantly impact the potential for future impairments. The sales objectives can differ among subdivisions, even within a given sub-market. For example, facts and circumstances in a given subdivision may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace, while facts and circumstances in another subdivision may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins from home sales, even though this could result in a slower sales absorption pace. Furthermore, the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated. For example, a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in home sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace. Additionally, a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one subdivision that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby subdivision. Changes in our key assumptions, including estimated construction and land development costs, absorption pace and selling strategies could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates. Due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors, we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful to an investor.
If the undiscounted future cash flows of a subdivision are less than its carrying value, the carrying value of the subdivision is written down to its then estimated fair value. We determine the estimated fair value of each subdivision either: (1) by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows at discount rates that are commensurate with the risk of the subdivision under evaluation; or (2) assessing the market value of the land in its current condition by considering the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land (other than in a forced liquidation), and recent land purchase transactions that we believe are indicators of fair value. The estimated future cash flows are the same for both our recoverability and fair value assessments. Factors we consider when determining the discount rate to be used for each subdivision include, among others:
•the number of lots in a given subdivision;
•the amount of future land development costs to be incurred;
•risks associated with the home construction process, including the stage of completion for the entire subdivision and the number of owned lots under construction; and
•the estimated remaining lifespan of the subdivision.
We allocate the impairments recorded between housing completed or under construction and land and land under development for each impaired subdivision based upon the status of construction of a home on each lot (i.e., if the lot is in housing completed or under construction, the impairment for that lot is recorded against housing completed or under construction). The allocation of impairment is the same with respect to each lot in a given subdivision. Changes in management’s estimates, particularly the timing and amount of the estimated future cash inflows and outflows and forecasted average selling prices of homes to be sold and closed can materially affect any impairment calculation. Because our forecasted cash flows are impacted significantly by changes in market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Please see the “Inventory Impairments” section for a detailed discussion and analysis of our asset impairments.
If land is classified as held for sale, we measure it at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In determining fair value, we primarily rely upon the most recent negotiated price. If a negotiated price is not available, we will consider several factors including, but not limited to, current market conditions, recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies. If the fair value less estimated costs to sell is lower than the current carrying value, the land is impaired down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
Warranty Accrual. Our homes are sold with limited third-party warranties. We record expenses and warranty accruals for general and structural warranty claims, as well as accruals for known, unusual warranty-related expenditures. A warranty accrual is recorded for each home closed based upon historical payment experience in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. The determination of the warranty accrual rate for closed homes and the evaluation of our warranty accrual balance at period end are based on an internally developed analysis that includes known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including, among other things, our trends in historical warranty payment levels and warranty payments for claims not considered to be normal and recurring. Actual future warranty costs could differ from currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual.
Insurance Reserves. The establishment of reserves for estimated losses associated with insurance policies issued by Allegiant and re-insurance agreements issued by StarAmerican are based on actuarial studies that include known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including our experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix or concentration, claim severity, frequency patterns depending on the business conducted, and changing regulatory and legal environments. Historical trends in claim severity and frequency patterns have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. It is possible that changes in the insurance payment experience used in estimating our ultimate insurance losses could have a material impact on our insurance reserves. A 10% increase in both the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase in our insurance reserves and an associated increase in expense of approximately $15.3 million. A 10% decrease in both the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease in our insurance reserves and an associated reduction in expense of $13.9 million.
Litigation Accruals. In the normal course of business, we are a defendant in claims primarily relating to premises liability, product liability and personal injury claims. These claims seek relief from us under various theories, including breach of implied and express warranty, negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation and violation of consumer protection statutes. We have accrued for losses that may be incurred with respect to legal claims based upon information provided by our legal counsel, including counsel’s on-going evaluation of the merits of the claims and defenses and the level of estimated insurance coverage. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could vary from those accruals and could have a material impact on our results of operations.
Revenue Recognition for Homebuilding Segments. We recognize home sale revenues from home deliveries when we have satisfied the performance obligations within the sales agreement, which is generally when title to and possession of the home are transferred to the buyer at the home closing date. Revenue from a home delivery includes the base sales price and any purchased options and upgrades and is reduced for any sales price incentives.
In certain states where we build, we are not always able to complete certain outdoor features (such as landscaping or pools) prior to closing the home. To the extent these separate deliverables are not complete upon the closing of a home, we defer home sale revenues related to incomplete outdoor features, and recognize that revenue upon completion of the outdoor features.
Revenue Recognition for HomeAmerican: Revenues recorded by HomeAmerican primarily reflect (1) origination fees and (2) the corresponding sale, or expected future sale, of a loan, which will include the estimated earnings from either the release or retention of a loan’s servicing rights. Origination fees are recognized when a loan is originated. When an interest rate lock commitment is made to a customer, we record the expected gain on sale of the mortgage, plus the estimated earnings from the expected sale of the associated servicing rights, adjusted for a pull-through percentage (which is defined as the likelihood that an interest rate lock commitment will be originated), as revenue. As the interest rate lock commitment gets closer to being originated, the expected gain on the sale of that loan plus its servicing rights is updated to reflect current market value and the increase or decrease in the fair value of that interest rate lock commitment is recorded through revenues. At the same time, the expected pull-through percentage of the interest rate lock commitment to be originated is updated (typically an increase as the interest lock commitment gets closer to origination) and, if there has been a change, revenues are adjusted as necessary. After origination, our mortgage loans, generally including their servicing rights, are sold to third-party purchasers in accordance with sale agreements entered into by us with a third-party purchaser of the loans. We make representations and warranties with respect to the status of loans transferred in the sale agreements. The sale agreements generally include statements acknowledging the transfer of the loans is intended by both parties to constitute a sale. Sale of a mortgage loan has occurred when the following criteria, among others, have been met: (1) fair consideration has been paid for transfer of the loan by a third party in an arms-length transaction, (2) all the usual risks and rewards of ownership that are in substance a sale have been transferred by us to the third party purchaser; and (3) we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the mortgage loan.
We carry interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value.
Home Cost of Sales. Refer to the Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the financial statements for information on the composition of home cost of sales. When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid or incurred all costs necessary to complete the construction of the home and certain land development costs. At the time of a home closing, we compare the home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional estimated costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. For amounts not incurred or paid as of the time of closing a home, we record an estimated accrual associated with certain home construction and land development costs. Generally, these accruals are established based upon contracted work which has yet to be paid, open work orders not paid at the time of home closing, as well as land completion costs more likely than not to be incurred, and represent estimates believed to be adequate to cover the expected remaining home construction and land development costs. We monitor the adequacy of these accruals on a house-by-house basis and in the aggregate on both a market-by-market and consolidated basis.
Stock-Based Compensation. ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) requires that share-based compensation expense be measured and recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments granted under compensation arrangements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, annual forfeiture rates and the expected life of an award. For stock option awards granted with just service and/or performance conditions, we estimate the fair value using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For any stock option awards granted that contain a market condition, we estimate the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Both the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation utilize the following inputs to calculate the estimated fair value of stock options: (1) closing price of our common stock on the measurement date (generally the date of grant); (2) exercise price; (3) expected stock option life; (4) expected volatility; (5) risk-free interest rate; and (6) expected dividend yield rate. The expected life of employee stock options represents the period for which the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is derived primarily from historical exercise patterns. The expected volatility is determined based on our review of the implied volatility that is derived from the price of exchange traded options of the Company. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts. We determine the estimated fair value of the stock option awards on the date they were granted. The fair values of previously granted stock option awards are not adjusted as subsequent changes in the foregoing assumptions occur; for example, an increase or decrease in the price of our common stock. However, changes in the foregoing inputs, particularly the price of our common stock, expected stock option life and expected volatility, significantly change the estimated fair value of future grants of stock options.
An annual forfeiture rate is estimated at the time of grant, and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs from our estimate.
