Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Except where the context otherwise requires, the terms “Finance of America Companies,” “Finance of America,”“FoA,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the business of Finance of America Companies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
Finance of America Companies Inc. is a vertically integrated, consumer and specialty lending platform that connects borrowers with investors. We offer a diverse set of high quality consumer loan products and distribute financial risk to investors for an up-front
cash profit and often retain a future performance-based participation. We believe we have a differentiated, less volatile strategy than mono-line mortgage lenders who focus on originating interest rate sensitive traditional mortgages and retain significant portfolios of mortgage servicing rights with large potential future advancing obligations. In addition to our profitable lending operations, we provide a variety of services to lenders through our Lender Services segment, which augments our lending profits with an attractive fee-oriented
revenue stream. Our differentiated strategy is built upon a few key fundamental factors:
•
We operate in a diverse set of lending markets that benefit from strong, secular tailwinds and are each influenced by different demand drivers. We believe this diversification results in stable and growing earnings with lower volatility and lower mortgage market correlation than a traditional mortgage company.
•
We seamlessly connect borrowers with investors. Our consumer-facing business leaders interact directly with the investor-facing professionals in our Portfolio Management segment, facilitating the development of attractive lending solutions for our customers with the confidence that the loans we generate can be efficiently and profitably sold to a deep pool of investors. While we often retain a future performance-based participation in the underlying cash flows of our loan products, we seek to programmatically and profitably monetize most of our loan products through a variety of investor channels, which minimizes capital at risk.
•
We distribute our products through multiple channels, and utilize flexible technology platforms and a distributed workforce in order to scale our businesses and manage costs efficiently. Our businesses are supported by a centralized business excellence office (“BXO”), providing all corporate support, including IT, Finance and Accounting, Treasury, Human Resources, Legal, Risk and Compliance. This platform enables us to focus our resources as the opportunity set evolves while not being overly reliant on any individual product. As borrower demands for lending products change, we are able to change with them and continue to offer desirable lending solutions.
Today, we are principally focused on (1) residential mortgage loan products throughout the U.S., offering traditional mortgage loans, reverse mortgage loans, home improvement loans, and (2) business purpose loans to real estate investors. We have built a distribution network that allows our customers to interact with us through their preferred method: in person, via a broker or digitally. Our product offering diversity makes us resilient in varying rate and origination environments, and differentiates us from traditional mortgage lenders. Our Lender Services segment supports a range of financial institutions, including our lending companies, with services such as title insurance and settlement services, appraisal management, valuation and brokerage services, fulfillment services, and technology platforms for student and consumer loans. In addition to creating recurring third party revenue streams, these service business lines allow us to better serve our lending customers and maximize our revenue per lending transaction. Furthermore, our Portfolio Management segment provides structuring and product development expertise, allowing innovation and improved visibility of execution for our originations, as well as broker/dealer and institutional asset management capabilities. These capabilities allow us to complete profitable securitization of our originated loans, including 1 securitization during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021, and 10 securitizations during the Successor period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. During an otherwise volatile 2020, 10 securitizations were completed, demonstrating the high quality and liquidity of the loan products we originate, the deep relationships we have with our investors and the resilience of our business model in any market environment.
The Business Combination
On October 12, 2020, FoA, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Replay, Replay Acquisition Corp. (“Replay”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, and FoA Equity agreed to a business combination that would result in FoA becoming a publicly traded company. FoA Equity, Replay, FoA; RPLY

structure.
Our Segments
We manage our Company in five reportable segments: Mortgage Originations, Reverse Originations, Commercial Originations, Lender Services, and Portfolio Management. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments is provided below:
Mortgage Originations
Our Mortgage Originations segment originates residential mortgage loans through our FAM subsidiary. This segment generates revenue through fee-based
mortgage loan origination services and the origination and sale of agency and non-agency
mortgage loans into the secondary market. We generally sell originated mortgage loans into the secondary market within 30 days of origination and elect whether to sell or retain the rights to service the underlying mortgage loans based on the economics in the market and Company portfolio investment strategies. Whether the Company elects to sell or retain the rights to service the underlying loans, the Mortgage Originations segment realizes the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights in gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net until the date of loan sale. Subsequent fair value changes of the retained mortgage servicing rights are accounted for within fee income in the Portfolio Management segment results.
The Mortgage Originations segment includes four channels:
•
Distributed Retail-Our distributed retail lending channel relies on mortgage advisors in retail branch locations across the country to acquire, interact with, and serve customers. Our distributed retail network controls all of the loan origination process, including sourcing the borrower, processing the application, setting the interest rate, ordering appraisal and underwriting, processing, closing and funding the loan.
•
Direct-to-Consumer-Our
direct-to-consumer
lending channel relies on our call centers, website and mobile apps to interact with customers. Our primary focus is to assist our customers with a refinance or home purchase by providing them with a needs-based approach to understanding their current mortgage options.
•
TPO-Our third party-originator (“TPO”) lending channel works with mortgage brokers to source loans which are then underwritten and funded by us, as FoA. Counterparty risk is mitigated through quality and compliance monitoring, and all brokers are subject to our eligibility requirements coupled with an annual recertification process.
•
Home Improvement-Our home improvement channel is our newest distribution channel and was created through the acquisition of the operations of Renovate America during the first quarter of 2021. This channel assists homeowners in the financing of short-term home improvement projects, such as windows, HVAC, or remodeling and relies on a network of partner contractors across the country to acquire, interact with, and serve these customers.
Our mortgage lending activities primarily consist of the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans to the government sponsored entities (“GSEs”), including Fannie Mae Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, as well as the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans to private investors. The Mortgage Originations segment generates revenue and earnings in the form of gains on sale of loans, fair value gains, interest income, and fees earned on the successful origination of mortgage loans.
Reverse Originations
Our Reverse Originations segment originates or acquires reverse mortgage loans through our FAR subsidiary. This segment originates HECM and non-agency
reverse mortgages.
We securitize HECMs into HMBS, which Ginnie Mae guarantees, and sell them in the secondary market while retaining the rights to service. Non-agency
reverse mortgages, which complement the FHA HECM for higher value homes, may be sold as whole loans to investors or held for investment and pledged as collateral to securitized nonrecourse debt obligations. Non-agency
reverse mortgage loans are not insured by the FHA.
We originate reverse mortgage loans through the following channels:
•
Retail-Our retail channel consists of field offices and a centralized retail platform, which includes a telephone based platform with multiple loan officers in one location. Our retail network controls all of the loan origination process, including sourcing the borrower, processing the application, setting the interest rate, ordering appraisal and underwriting, processing, closing and funding the loan.
•
TPO-Our TPO lending channel works with mortgage brokers to source loans which are then underwritten and funded by us, as FoA. Counterparty risk is mitigated through quality and compliance monitoring, and all brokers are subject to our eligibility requirements coupled with an annual recertification process.
The Reverse Originations segment generates revenue and earnings in the form of fair value gains at the time of origination (“Net origination gains”) and origination fees earned on the successful origination of reverse mortgage loans.
Commercial Originations
Our Commercial Originations segment originates or acquires commercial mortgage loans through our FACo subsidiary. The segment provides business purpose lending solutions for residential real estate investors in two principal ways: short-term loans to provide rehab and construction of investment properties meant to be sold upon completion, and investor rental loans collateralized by either a single property or portfolio of properties. The segment also provides government-insured agricultural lending solutions to farmers to fund their inputs and operating expenses for the upcoming growing season. The segment does not provide financing for consumer-purpose, owner occupied loans or non-residential
purpose commercial lending.
We originate commercial mortgage loans through the following channels:
•
Retail-Our retail channel consists of sales team members located throughout the United States with concentrations in Charlotte, NC, Chicago, IL, and Irvine, CA. Our retail network controls all of the loan origination process, including sourcing the borrower, processing the application, setting the interest rate, ordering appraisal and underwriting, processing, closing and funding the loan.
•
TPO-Our TPO lending channel works with mortgage brokers to source loans which are then underwritten and funded by us, as FoA. Counterparty risk is mitigated through quality and compliance monitoring, and all brokers are subject to our eligibility requirements coupled with an annual recertification process.
The Commercial Originations segment generates revenue and earnings in the form of fair value gains at the time of origination (“Net origination gains”) and origination fees earned on the successful origination of commercial mortgage loans.
Lender Services
Our Lender Services segment provides complementary business services around the residential mortgage, student lending, and commercial lending industries. These complementary services include; title agency and title insurance services, MSR valuation and trade brokerage, transactional fulfillment services, and appraisal management services to our retail customers. The team is primarily based in St. Paul, MN and Charlotte, NC. The segment also operates a foreign branch in the Philippines for transactional fulfillment and administrative support.
•
Title agency and title insurance services-Lender Services provides consumers with in house title agency and title insurance services, which contributes to a more efficient close process by eliminating the need to shop out necessary services to finalize the loan process.
•
MSR valuation and trade brokerage-Lender Services provides MSR valuation services through a wholly owned subsidiary for both internal and external parties. Additionally, lender services facilitates MSR trades through the same wholly owned subsidiary.
Our Lender Services segment generates revenue and earnings in the form of fee-for-service
revenue and commissions on successful MSR trades.
Portfolio Management
Our Portfolio Management segment provides product development, loan securitization, loan sales, risk management, servicing oversight, and asset management services to the enterprise and third party funds. The team is primarily based in St. Paul, MN and New York, NY.
As part of the vertical integration of our business, our Portfolio Management team acts as the connector between borrowers and investors. Our deep experience in product development and innovation allows us to assist borrowers in new and unique ways by connecting their needs with our proprietary products. The direct connections to investors, provided by our FINRA registered broker-dealer, complete the lending lifecycle in a way that allows us to innovate and manage risk through better price and product discovery. Given our scale, we are able to work directly with investors and where appropriate, retain assets on balance sheet for attractive return opportunities. These retained investments are a source of growing and recurring earnings.
The retained asset portfolio generally consists of two classifications of assets: short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term investments are primarily proprietary whole loans and securities that are held for sale and loans bought from HECM securitizations prior to assignment to Ginnie Mae. Long-term investments are primarily made up of mortgage servicing rights, securitized HECM loans, securitized proprietary whole loans (including retained securities and residual interests in securitization trusts), and whole loans not yet securitized.
The retained assets are initially recorded to the portfolio at a designated fair-value-based transfer price, if originated by any of the Company’s origination segments (“Net origination gains” recognized by the origination segments), or at the price purchased from external parties. Retained financial assets are adjusted to their current fair value on an ongoing basis.
The Portfolio Management segment generates revenue and earnings in the form of gains on sale of loans, fair value gains on portfolio assets, interest income, and fee income related to mortgage servicing rights, underwriting, advisory, valuation, and other ancillary services.
Business Trends and Conditions
There are a number of key factors and trends affecting our results of operations. A summary of key factors impacting our revenue include:
•
prevailing interest rates which impact loan origination volume, with declining interest rates leading to increases in volume, and an increasing interest rate environment leading to decreases in the volume;
•
housing market trends which also impact loan origination volume, with a strong housing market leading to higher loan origination volume, and a weak housing market leading to lower loan origination volume;
•
demographic and housing stock trends which impact the addressable market size of mortgage, reverse and commercial loan originations;
•
increases in loan modifications, delinquency rates, delinquency status and prepayment speeds; and
•
broad economic factors such as the strength and stability of the overall economy, including the unemployment level and real estate values which have been substantially affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, further discussed below. The COVID-19
pandemic poses unique challenges to our business and the effects of the pandemic could adversely impact our ability to originate and service mortgages, manage our portfolio of assets and provide lender services and could also adversely impact our counterparties, liquidity and employees.
Other factors that may affect our cost base include trends in salaries and benefits costs, sales commissions, technology, rent, legal, compliance and other general and administrative costs. Management continually monitors these costs through operating plans.
Evaluation of recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets
•
The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitors for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Because of a significant and sustained decline in stock price and market capitalization, the Company determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
The Company estimated the fair value of all reporting units utilizing a market approach and the significant assumptions used to measure fair value include discount rate, terminal factors, market multiples, and control premiums. As a result of its annual impairment test, the Company recognized an impairment to goodwill and intangible assets of $1,045.1 million. During the fourth quarter, the Company’s stock price experienced an additional sustained decline, triggering an interim impairment analysis as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in recognition of additional impairment of the remaining goodwill of $335.5 million. This impairment charge was recognized in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but does not negatively impact tangible book value.
The Company did not identify any impairment for the Predecessor periods from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 or the Predecessor years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Impact of COVID-19
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”)
and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19
outbreak as a pandemic (the “COVID-19
pandemic”), continue to evolve, including with respect to current and future variants of COVID-19.
The COVID-19
pandemic has materially impacted and continues to materially impact the markets in which the Company operates. It has caused significant volatility in market liquidity as well as fluctuations in yields required by market investors in the type of financial instruments originated by the Company’s primary operating subsidiaries. While vaccine availability and uptake has increased, the longer-term macro-economic effects of the pandemic on global supply chains, inflation, labor shortages and wage increases continue to impact many industries, including the industries in which our Company and its subsidiaries operate. Moreover, with the potential for new strains of COVID-19
to emerge, governments and businesses may re-impose
aggressive measures to help slow its spread in the future. For this reason, among others, as the COVID-19
pandemic continues, the potential global impacts are uncertain and difficult to assess.
In the U.S., significant fiscal stimulus measures, monetary policy actions and other relief measures have helped to moderate the negative economic impacts of COVID-19.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted into law. In March 2021, the U.S. federal government passed a $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”), which together with the CARES Act and other fiscal stimulus measures- enacted by the federal government, provided for, among other things, funding to state and local governments, direct payments to households, support for small businesses, renter assistance and funding for transport, airlines, healthcare and education. Monetary policy decisions included quantitative easing and the provision of liquidity to financial institutions and credit markets. In addition, housing measures, such as forbearance on mortgages and suspension of foreclosures and evictions enacted by federal, state and local governments, and various executive orders have helped to provide relief. However, many of the forbearance on mortgages, foreclosure and eviction measures have lapsed or are set to lapse in 2022. Further, certain moratoria have been successfully challenged in lawsuits. In response to the expiration of certain of these measures, on June 28, 2021 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a final rule, which went into effect on August 31, 2021, amending certain provisions in Regulation X regarding additional assistance for borrowers on mortgage loans secured by their principal residence experiencing a COVID-19-related
hardship. This rule includes temporary provisions imposing further restrictions on foreclosure and providing for streamlined loan modification, among other features. Given the scheduled expiration of, and legal challenges to, relief measures, there can be no assurance as to the extent to which relief will continue to be granted in the future.
The full impact of the COVID-19
pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this report. The Company’s work-from-home
environment is anticipated to continue, with certain exceptions for employees whose job functions or other considerations require them to be in a physical office from time to time. The Company’s management is actively monitoring the global situation relating to COVID-19
and its effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. Further, the Company cannot estimate the length or gravity of the impact that the COVID-19
pandemic on the residential mortgage and commercial lending industries. As of December 31, 2021, the COVID-19
pandemic continues to impact the economic environment in which the Company conducts business. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 0.25% of units and 0.26% of unpaid principal balance of the Company’s total residential mortgage servicing portfolio is in forbearance as a result of the economic impacts caused by COVID-19.
These continuing economic impacts, and the continuation of the pandemic itself, may cause additional volatility in the financial markets and may have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of future operations, financial position, intangible assets and liquidity in 2022 and beyond. See Results of Operations.

pandemic reference Risks Related to COVID-19”
under “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Reorganization Transactions
FoA was incorporated in October 2020 and is a financial services holding corporation, the principal asset of which is a controlling interest in FoA Equity. The business, property and affairs of FoA Equity are managed by a board of managers, appointed by FoA at its sole discretion. In periods subsequent to the April 1, 2021 closing of
the Business Combination, FoA consolidates FoA Equity and reports a non-controlling
interest related to the Class A LLC Units held by the Continuing Unitholders in FoA’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, we executed several reorganization transactions, as a result of which the limited liability company agreement of FoA Equity was amended and restated to, among other things, reclassify its outstanding limited liability company units into a single new class of units that are referred to as “Class A LLC Units.”
FoA, FoA Equity and the Continuing Unitholders entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) under which they (or certain permitted transferees) have the right (subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement) to exchange their Class A LLC Units for shares of FoA Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one
basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications.
The Continuing Unitholders hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of FoA’s Class B Common Stock. The shares of Class B Common Stock have no economic rights, but entitle each holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by such holder, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of Class A LLC Units held by such holder on all matters on which shareholders of FoA are entitled to vote generally. Holders of shares of FoA’s Class B Common Stock vote together with holders of FoA’s Class A Common Stock as a single class on all matters on which shareholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.
Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations
As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors that may impact the comparability of our results of operations in future periods.
Impact of the Business Combination
FoA is a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. FoA Equity was and is treated as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, entity level taxes at FoA Equity are not and have not been significant. Accordingly, provision for income taxes prior to the Business Combination consisted of tax expense related only to certain of the consolidated subsidiaries of FoA Equity that are structured as corporations and subject to U.S. federal income taxes as well as state taxes. Subsequent to the Business Combinations, FoA (together with certain corporate subsidiaries through which it owns its interest in FoA Equity) pays U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation on its share of FoA Equity’s taxable income.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, including any identified intangible assets, of FoA Equity were recorded at their fair values at the date of the consummation of the Business Combination, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value recorded as goodwill. The application of business combination accounting required the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
As a result of the application of business combination accounting, the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of FoA Equity are not necessarily indicative of FoA’s future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For example, increased tangible and intangible assets resulting from adjusting the basis of tangible and intangible assets to their fair value have resulted in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the periods following the consummation of the Business Combination.
Additionally, in connection with the Business Combination, FoA entered into Tax Receivable Agreements (“TRA”) with the TRA Parties that provide for the payment by FoA to such owners of 85% of the benefits that
FoA is deemed to realize as a result of (i) tax basis adjustments that will increase the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of FoA as a result of sales or exchanges of Class A LLC Units in connection with or after the Business Combination or distributions with respect to the Class A LLC Units prior to or in connection with the Business Combination, (ii) FoA’s utilization of certain tax attributes attributable to the Blocker or the Blocker Shareholders, and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRAs, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRAs.
Impact of Becoming a Public Company
We have incurred and expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. These costs include additional personnel, legal, consulting, regulatory, insurance, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and national securities exchanges, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that are not applicable to a private company. These additional rules and regulations increase our legal, regulatory and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net
Gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments, hedging derivatives, and originated mortgage servicing rights. The Company sells mortgage loans into the secondary market, including, but not limited to, sales to the GSEs on a servicing-released basis, where the loans are sold to an investor with the associated MSRs transferred to the investor or to a separate third party investor. In addition, the Company may opportunistically sell loans on a servicing-retained basis, where the loan is sold and the Company retains the rights to service that loan. Unrealized gains and losses include fair value gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value in the underlying mortgages, interest rate lock commitments, hedging derivatives, and originated MSRs, from the time of origination to the ultimate sale of the loan or other settlement of those financial instruments.
Net fair value gains on loans and related obligations
The majority of our outstanding financial instruments are carried at fair value. The yield recognized on these financial instruments and any changes in estimated fair value are recorded as a component of net fair value gains on loans and related obligations. See Note 5-Fair Value within our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements.
Fee Income
We earn various fees from our customers during the process of origination and servicing of loans as well as providing services to third party customers. These fees include loan servicing and origination fees, title and closing service fees, title underwriting servicing fees, settlement fees, appraisal fees and broker fees. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations have been satisfied, which is typically at the time of loan origination or when the service to the third-party has been provided.
In addition to the fees earned from customers, we recognize the changes in fair value of MSRs as current period income (loss). To hedge against volatility in the fair value of MSRs, we enter into various derivative agreements, which may include but are not limited to interest rate swap futures. Changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments and the related hedging gains and losses are also included as a component of fee income.
Net interest income (expense)
We earn interest income on mortgage loans and incur interest expense on our warehouse lines of credit and non-funding
debt. Interest income and interest expense also accrues to loans held for investment, including securitized loans subject to HMBS and other nonrecourse debt. Such interest is included as a component of net fair value gains on loans and related obligations.
Operating Expenses
Salaries, benefits and related expenses
Salaries, benefits and related expenses includes commissions, bonuses, equity based compensation, salaries, benefits, taxes and all payroll related expenses for our employees.
Occupancy, equipment rentals and other office related expenses
Occupancy, equipment rentals and other office related expenses includes rent expense on office space and equipment, and other occupancy related costs.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses primarily include loan origination expenses, loan portfolio expenses, professional fees, business development costs, communications and data processing costs, title and closing costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses.
Other, Net
Other, net, primarily includes gains or losses on non-operating
assets, revaluation of the warrant liability, and remeasurement of the TRA obligations.
Income Taxes
FoA Equity was and is treated as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, entity level taxes at FoA Equity are not significant. Prior to the Business Combination, provision for income taxes consisted of tax expense related only to certain of the consolidated subsidiaries of FoA Equity that are structured as corporations and subject to U.S. federal income taxes as well as state taxes.
Subsequent to the Business Combination, FoA (together with certain corporate subsidiaries through which it owns its interest in FoA Equity) is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and is subject to U.S. federal income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of FoA Equity and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. FoA is a holding company and its only material asset is its direct and indirect interest in FoA Equity. Accordingly, a provision for income taxes is recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of FoA’s allocable share of FoA Equity’s reported results of operations for federal income taxes. In addition to tax expenses, FoA also incurs expenses related to its operations, as well as payments under the TRAs, which are significant. FoA Equity may distribute amounts sufficient to allow FoA to pay its tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any payments due under the TRAs. See “Certain Agreements Related to the Business Combination-Tax Receivable Agreements.” However, the ability of FoA Equity to make such distributions may be limited due to, among other things, restrictive covenants in its financing lines of credit and senior notes.
Results of Operations
Overview
The following tables present selected financial data for the Successor period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, and for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021. Additionally, we have presented the Predecessor selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We have prepared our discussion of the results of current year operations by comparing the results of the combined Successor period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and Predecessor period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 with the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2020. The core business operations of the Predecessor and Successor were not significantly impacted by the consummation of the Business Combination. Therefore we believe the combined results for the Successor period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and the Predecessor period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 are comparable to the year ended December 31, 2020 and provide enhanced comparability to the reader about the current year’s results. We believe this approach provides the most meaningful basis of comparison and is useful in identifying current business trends for the periods presented. The combined results of operations included in our discussion below are not considered to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations, may not reflect the actual results we would have achieved had the Business Combination occurred at the beginning of 2021, and should not be viewed as a substitute for the results of operations of the Predecessor and Successor periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Consolidated Results
The following table summarizes our consolidated operating results for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Net fair value gains on loans and related obligations
Certain of our financial instruments are valued utilizing a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value. The cash flow assumptions and prepayment and repayment assumptions used in the model are based on various factors, with the key assumptions being prepayment and repayment speeds, credit loss frequencies and severity, and discount rate assumptions. Any changes in fair value on these financial instruments is recorded as a gain or loss in net fair value gains on loans and related obligations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following table summarizes the components of net fair value gains on loans and related obligations for the periods indicated (in thousands):
(1)
This line item includes realization of interest income and interest expense related to loans held for investment and securitization trusts, and runoff and portfolio amortization
Principally, all of our outstanding financial instruments are carried at fair value. The yield recognized on these financial instruments and any changes in estimated fair value are recorded as a component of net fair value gains on loans and related obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, for certain of our outstanding financing lines of credit, we have not elected to account for these liabilities under the fair value option. Accordingly, interest expense is presented separately on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further, interest income on collateralized loans may be reflected in net fair value gains on loans and related obligations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, while the associated interest expense on the pledged loans will be included as a component of net interest expense. We evaluate net interest margin (“NIM”) for our outstanding investments through an evaluation of all components of interest income and interest expense.
The following table provides an analysis of all components of NIM for the periods indicated (in thousands):

For the year ended December
31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) versus the year ended December
31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Net income (loss) before taxes decreased $1.7 billion or 339.1% primarily as a result of the following:
•
Gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, decreased $323.1 million or 27.4% primarily as a result of lower Mortgage Originations segment revenue margin. Our margin on originated mortgage loans decreased to 2.86% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 3.88% for the comparable 2020 period. Our Mortgage Originations segment had $29.0 billion in net rate lock volume for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $30.2 billion for the comparable 2020 period.
•
Net fair value gains on loans and related obligations increased by $106.7 million or 34.2% primarily as a result of growth in net origination gains from our Reverse and Commercial Originations segments, partially offset by fair value losses from market inputs or model assumptions. The Reverse Originations segment recognized $385.6 million in net origination gains on originations of $4.3 billion of reverse mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $192.3 million on origination of $2.7 billion for the comparable 2020 period. The Commercial Originations segment recognized $43.2 million in net origination gains on origination of $1.8 billion in loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $13.4 million on origination of $855.3 million during the comparable 2020 period. Fair value losses from changes in market inputs or model assumptions were 145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to fair value adjustments related predominantly to increases in modeled prepayment speeds on securitized mortgage assets. This
compares to $32.6 million in fair value losses from changes in market inputs or model assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2020 driven largely by unfavorable shocks to fair value during the early months of the COVID-19
pandemic. See Note 5-Fair Value within the consolidated financial statements for additional information on assumptions impacting the value of our loans held for investment.
•
Fee income increased $157.6 million or 40.4% primarily due to growth in Commercial loan originations, as well as in our Lender Services segment. Our Commercial Originations segment grew fee revenue by $28.1 million or 117.7% primarily as a result of a 106.8% increase in loan origination volume during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in commercial loan origination volume is partially attributable to a temporary deferment of commercial production in March to May of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and impact to capital markets demand for non-GSE or government loan products. Within our Lender Services segment, we experienced growth in lender fees of $123.5 million or 60.2% due to increase of 82.1% in loan closings in which we acted as title agent and growth of 152.5% in our underwriting activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable 2020 period.
•
Total expenses increased $263.3 million or 20.4% due to higher salaries, benefits and related expenses combined with increased general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of our higher loan origination volumes during the year ended December 31, 2021, overall enterprise growth, and expenses related to the Business Combination. During the second quarter of 2021, one-time
initial and accelerated Replacement and Earnout Right RSU expense of $38.6 million was recognized. Additional on-going
expenses of $24.2 million for the RSUs and $40.7 million of amortization of intangibles relating to the business combination were recognized.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019
Net income before taxes increased $422.7 million or 544.8% as a result of higher gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, and fee income on originated mortgage loans and from our Lender Services segment, offset partially by lower net fair value gains on loans and related obligations and higher expenses.
•
Gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, increased $714.7 million or 153.9% primarily as a result of higher loan originations in our Mortgage Originations segment and a general widening in margins related to GSE and government guaranteed loan products. We originated $29,064.4 million in residential mortgage loans in 2020, compared to $15,437.1 million, an 88.3% increase over 2019. The higher loan origination volume is attributable to the favorable interest rate environment in 2020, which was 99 bps lower than 2019, leading to an increase in refinance production. Our margin on originated mortgage loans increased to 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.80% for the comparable 2019 period.
•
Net fair value gains on loans and related obligations decreased by $17.8 million primarily as a result of $32.6 million in fair value losses from changes in market inputs or model assumptions in 2020 driven largely by shocks to fair value yields during the early months of the COVID-19
pandemic, partially offset by $34.1 million increase in net origination gains during 2020 compared to 2019. See Note 5-Fair Value within the annual audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on assumptions impacting the value of loans held for investment.
•
Fee income increased $190.8 million or 95.8% as a result of our higher loan origination volumes.
•
Net interest expense decreased $21.0 million or 20.7% in 2020 as a result of the favorable interest rate environment in 2020 compared to 2019. This reduced the interest expense on our warehouse lines of credit. Additionally, the favorable interest rate environment resulted in lower interest rates on the debt associated with the 10 securitizations executed in 2020, which are recorded in net fair value gains on loans and related obligations.
•
Total expenses increased $475.5 million or 58.1% due to higher salaries, benefits and related expenses combined with an increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of higher loan origination volumes during the period and overall enterprise growth.
SEGMENT RESULTS
Revenue generated on inter-segment services performed are valued based on estimated market value. Revenue and fees are directly allocated to their respective segments at the time services are performed. Expenses directly attributable to the operating segments are expensed as incurred. Other expenses are allocated to individual segments based on the estimated value of services performed, total revenue contributions, personnel headcount or the equity invested in each segment based on the type of expense allocated. The allocation methodology is reviewed annually. There were no changes to methodology during the year ended December 31, 2021. Expenses for enterprise-level general overhead, such as executive administration, are not allocated to the business segments.
Mortgage Originations Segment
The following table summarizes our Mortgage Origination segment’s results for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Our Mortgage Originations segment generates its revenues primarily from the origination and sale of residential mortgages, including conforming mortgages, government mortgages insured by the FHA, VA and USDA, non-conforming
products such as jumbo mortgages, non-qualified
mortgages, closed-end
second mortgages and home improvement loans into the secondary market. Revenue from our Mortgage Originations segment includes cash gains recognized on the sale of mortgages, net of any estimated repurchase obligations, realized hedge gains and losses, fair value adjustments on loans held for sale, and any fair value adjustments on our outstanding interest rate lock pipeline and derivatives utilized to mitigate interest rate exposure on our outstanding mortgage pipeline. We also earn origination fees on the successful origination of mortgage loans which are recorded at the time of origination of the associated loans.
We utilize forward loan sale commitments, To Be Announced (“TBA”), and other forward delivery securities to fix the forward sales price that we will realize in the secondary market and to mitigate the interest rate risk to loan prices that we may be exposed to from the date we enter into rate locks with our customers until the date the loan is sold. We realize hedge gains and losses based on the value of the change in price in the underlying securities. When the position is closed, these amounts are recorded as realized hedge gains and losses.

Net origination gains increased by $29.8 million or 223.2%, primarily as a result of the increase in loan origination volume and increase in margin. We originated $1,769.1 million in commercial loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $855.3 million during the comparable 2020 period. In March of 2020, there was a temporary deferment of commercial production and a decrease in capital markets demand for non-GSE
or government loan products, which continued through the third quarter of 2020, due to the COVID-19
pandemic.
•
Fee income increased $28.1 million or 117.7% primarily as a result of a 106.8% increase in loan origination volume and fee income per originated loan during the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019

Total expenses increased $36.1 million or 87.3% as a result of the following:
•
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $21.9 million or 99.5% primarily due to the increase in average headcount and production related compensation to support the increased origination volume and allocation of share based compensation associated with the Business Combination. Salaries increased $12.2 million or 95.3% primarily due to the increase in average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 237 compared to 136 for the 2020 period. During the second quarter of 2021, one-time
initial and accelerated Replacement and Earnout Right RSU expense of $1.4 million was recognized. Additional on-going
expenses of $1.3 million were recognized for the RSUs issued at the time of the Business Combination.

Total expenses decreased 10.5 million or 20.3% as a result of lower general and administrative expenses combined with a decrease in salaries, benefits and related expenses.
•
Salaries, benefits and related expenses decreased $2.5 million or 10.1%, due to lower commissions and bonuses of $2.4 million or 25.4% as a result of the $379.4 million decrease in origination volume in 2020. The decrease in origination volume also caused a reduction in average headcount from 139 employees in 2019 to 136 employees in 2020. These decreases were driven by the temporary deferment of commercial production in March to May of 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic and the impact to capital markets demand for non-GSE
or government loan products. In March 2020, certain employees were transitioned from our Commercial Originations segment to our Mortgage Originations segment to support the growth in production volume in that segment.
•
General and administrative expenses decreased $8.0 million or 29.9% primarily due to decreased loan origination fees related to the suspension of loan originations in March 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic.

For the year ended December
31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) versus the year ended December
31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Total expenses increased $106.8 million or 57.6% as a result of the following:
•
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $45.3 million or 53.8%, primarily due to the staffing required to support the 152.5% increase in title insurance underwriting policies and 82.1% increase in title agent closings. Our average headcount increased in the 2021 period compared to the for the year ended December 31, 2020 in order to accommodate the demands of the business.

expenses of $1.9 million were recognized for the RSUs issued at the time of the Business Combination.
•
General and administrative expenses increased $61.0 million or 62.8% primarily due to higher title and closing expenses incurred associated with the 152.5% increase in title insurance underwriting policies volume and 82.1% increase in title agent closing volume. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $9.9 million of amortization of intangibles relating to the Business Combination were recognized.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019
Total expenses increased $80.2 million or 76.2% as a result of higher salaries, benefits and related expenses combined with an increase in general and administrative expenses.
•
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $31.2 million or 58.8%, primarily due to the staffing required to support the 84.1% increase year-over-year in title agent closings and a 116.8% increase year-over-year in title insurance underwriting policies.
•
General and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million or 96.6% primarily due to higher title and closing expenses incurred associated with the 84.1% increase year-over-year in title agent closings and a 116.8% increase year-over-year in title insurance underwriting policies.
Portfolio Management Segment
The following table summarizes our Portfolio Management segment results for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Our Portfolio Management segment generates its revenues primarily from the sale and securitization of residential mortgages into the secondary market, fair value gains and losses on loans and MSRs that we hold to maturity, servicing fee income related to the MSRs, and mortgage advisory fees earned on various investment and capital markets services we provide to our internal and external customers. The fair value gains and losses include the yield we recognize on the contractual interest income that is expected to be collected based on the stated interest rates of the loans and related liabilities, and any contractual service fees earned while servicing these assets.
Net fair value gains and losses in our Portfolio Management segment includes fair value adjustments related to the following assets and liabilities:
•
Loans held for investment, subject to HMBS liabilities, at fair value
•
Loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, at fair value
•
Loans held for investment, at fair value
•
Loans held for sale, at fair value(1)
•
HMBS liabilities, at fair value; and
•
Nonrecourse debt, at fair value.
(1)
Net fair value gains and losses in our Portfolio Management segment for loans held for sale only include fair value adjustments related to loans originated in the Commercial Originations segment.

The following table provides a summary of some of our Portfolio Management segment’s key metrics (dollars in thousands):
Revenue
In the table below is a summary of the components of our Portfolio Management segment’s total revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Principally, all of our outstanding financial instruments are carried at fair value. The yield recognized on these financial instruments and any changes in estimated fair value are recorded as a component of net fair value gains on loans and related obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, for certain of our outstanding financing lines of credit, we have not elected the fair value option. Accordingly, interest expense is presented separately on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further, interest income on collateralized loans may be reflected in net fair value gains on loans and related obligations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, while the associated interest expense on the pledged loans will be included as a component of net interest expense. We evaluate net interest margin (“NIM”) for our outstanding investments through an evaluation of all components of interest income and interest expense.
The following table provides an analysis of all components of NIM for the periods indicated (in thousands):
(1)
Net interest margin included in net fair value gains and losses on mortgage loans includes interest income and expense on all commercial and reverse loans and their related nonrecourse obligations. Interest income on mortgage loans and warehouse lines of credit are classified in net interest expense. See Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company’s accounting related to commercial and reverse mortgage loans.
Certain of our financial instruments are valued using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value. The cash flow assumptions and prepayment and repayment assumptions used in the model are based on various factors, with the key assumptions being prepayment speeds, credit loss frequencies and severity, and discount rate assumptions. Any changes in fair value on these financial instruments is recorded as a gain or loss in net fair value gains on loans and related obligations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) versus the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Total revenue decreased $51.6 million or 75.0% as a result of the following:
•
Gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, increased $34.8 million primarily due to increased commercial loan sales as a result of the increased commercial loan volume during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.
•
Net fair value losses from changes in market inputs or model assumptions increased $127.8 million due to fair value adjustments related predominantly to increases in modeled prepayment speeds on securitized mortgage assets due to an increases in home price appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable 2020 period.
•
Net interest expense on our warehouse lines decreased $6.7 million due primarily to a lower average cost of funds on our financing lines of credit.
•
Fee income increased $38.6 million primarily related to the increase of $33.2 million in servicing fee income as result of the increase in the MSR portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable 2020 period.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019
Total revenue decreased $4.3 million or 5.9% as a result of negative fair value adjustments recognized in 2020 primarily driven by higher required cost of funds for securitizations early during the COVID-19
pandemic. These losses were partially offset by $21.7 million decrease in warehouse interest expense.
•
Net fair value losses from changes in market inputs or model assumptions increased $50.7 million as a result of $29.7 million of fair value losses recognized in 2020 primarily driven by higher required cost of funds for securitizations during the first months of the COVID-19
pandemic. Financial markets were significantly disrupted resulting in significant negative fair value adjustments during 2020. See Note 5-Fair Value to the annual audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
•
Interest expense on warehouse lines decreased $21.7 million as the result of a decreasing interest rate environment year over year.
•
Servicing income increased $17.3 million. During the first months of the COVID-19
pandemic, liquidity and prices in the MSR market decreased making an MSR retention strategy more attractive. As a result, we increased retention of MSRs in March 2020. Our mortgage servicing portfolio increased to $22,269.4 million UPB as of December 31, 2020, compared to $288.1 million as of December 31, 2019.
Expenses
In the table below is a summary of the components of our Portfolio Management segment’s total expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):
For the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) versus the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Total expenses increased $25.7 million or 28.3% as a result of the following:
•
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $20.6 million or 74.1%, primarily due to allocated costs associated with the Business Combination, an increase in bonus compensation, and an increase in allocated shared services. During the second quarter of 2021, a one-time
initial and accelerated Replacement and Earnout Right RSU expense of $7.2 million was recognized. Additional on-going
expenses of $1.9 million were recognized for the RSUs issued at the time of the Business Combination.
•
General and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million or 7.4% primarily due to increased loan portfolio expenses related to the increase in subservicing expense on the retained MSR portfolio, which are included in servicing related expenses above, along with increases in fees related to the securitization of assets into nonrecourse securitizations, slightly offset by a decrease in other general and administrative expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019
Total expenses increased $26.9 million or 42.2% as a result of higher salaries, benefits and related expenses combined with an increase in general and administrative expenses.
•
Salaries, benefits and related expenses increased $7.6 million or 37.9%, primarily due to an increase in average headcount, which was 106 for the 2020 period versus 82 for the 2019 period. This increase is a result of growth in our servicing oversight function.
•
General and administrative expenses increased $19.7 million or 45.9% primarily due to servicing related expenses related to the increase in the retained MSR portfolio.
Corporate and Other
Our Corporate and Other segment consists of our BXO and other corporate services groups. These groups support our operating segments, and the cost of services directly supporting the operating segments are allocated to those operating segments on a cost of service basis. Enterprise-focused Corporate and Other expenses that are not incurred in direct support of the operating segments are kept unallocated within our Corporate and Other segment.
The following table summarizes our Corporate and Other segment’s results for the periods indicated (in thousands):
In the table below is a summary of the components of our Corporate and Other segment’s total expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):
For the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) versus the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor)
Net loss increased $55.0 million or 91.3% as a result of the following:
•
Total interest and other expense increased $21.9 million or 376.1% as a result of interest expense related to the senior unsecured notes issued in November 2020.
•
Salaries, benefits, and related expenses, net of allocations, increased $24.0 million or 90.3% primarily due to an increase in average headcount, bonus compensation and cost allocations related to the Business Combination. Average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 432 compared to 283 for the 2020 period. During the second quarter of 2021, one-time
initial and accelerated Replacement and Earnout Right RSU expense of $15.3 million was recognized. Additional on-going
expenses of $16.4 million were recognized for the RSUs issued at the time of the Business Combination. These increases were partially offset by an increase in allocations, as the cost associated with the increase in headcount during the period was allocated to each segment.
•
General and administrative expenses, net of shared services allocations, increased $18.9 million or 92.3% due to an increase in communications and data processing, higher professional fees, including legal and accounting advisory fees related to the Business Combination, offset slightly by an increase in shared services allocations.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019
Net loss increased $21.8 million or 56.5% as a result of higher salaries, benefits and related expenses, net of allocations, combined with higher general and administrative expenses, net of allocations.
•
Total interest expense increased $3.8 million or 73.7% as a result of higher interest expense due to higher average outstanding balances on our non-funding
lines of credit and the issuance of
$350.0 million in senior unsecured notes in November 2020. In 2020, the average balance on our non-funding
lines of credit was $48.6 million, compared to an average balance of $37.4 million during 2019.
•
Salaries, benefits, and related expenses, net of allocations, increased $7.2 million or 37.0% primarily due to an increase in commissions and accrued bonus compensation partially offset by increased allocations due to higher utilization of corporate services by our other segments.
•
General and administrative expenses, net of allocations, increased $11.3 million or 93.2% primarily due to higher nonrecurring professional fees, including legal and accounting advisory fees related to the Business Combination. The increase in general and administrative expenses was coupled with a decrease in shared services allocations of $6.9 million for 2020 compared to 2019.
NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company’s management evaluates performance of the Company through the use of certain non-GAAP
financial measures, including Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share.
The presentation of non-GAAP
measures is used to enhance the investors’ understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. This discussion is not meant to be considered in isolation, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These key financial measures provide an additional view of our performance over the long-term and provide useful information that we use in order to maintain and grow our business.
These non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered as an alternate to (i) net (loss) income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP or (ii) operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations of this metric are:
•
cash expenditures for future contractual commitments;
•
cash requirements for working capital needs;
•
cash requirements for certain tax payments; and
•
all non-cash
income/expense items reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or distribute to shareholders. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our non-GAAP
financial measures only as a supplement. Users of our consolidated financial statements are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our non-GAAP
financial measures.
Adjusted Net Income
We define Adjusted Net Income as consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for:
1. Change in fair value of loans and securities held for investment due to assumption changes
2. Amortization and other impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
3. Equity based compensation
4. Change in fair value of deferred purchase price obligations (including earnouts and TRA obligations), warrant liability, and minority investments
5. Certain non-recurring
costs
6. Pro-forma
tax provision attributable to noncontrolling interest
7. Pro-forma
tax effects of adjustments
Management believes these key financial measures provide an additional view of our performance over the long
term and provide useful information that we use in order to maintain and grow our business. Management considers Adjusted Net Income important in evaluating our Company as a whole. This supplemental metric is utilized by our management team to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use this measure when analyzing our operating performance and comparability to peers. Adjusted Net Income is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our definition and use of this measure may vary from other companies in our industry.
Adjusted Net Income provides visibility to the underlying operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are representative of our core earnings. Adjusted Net Income may also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with our intent of providing a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for:
1. Taxes
2. Interest on non-funding
debt
3. Depreciation
4. Change in fair value of loans and securities held for investment due to assumption changes
5. Amortization and other impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
6. Equity based compensation
7. Change in fair value of deferred purchase price obligations (including earnouts and TRA obligations), warrant liability and minority investments
8. Certain non-recurring
costs
We evaluate the performance of our company and segments through the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP
measure. Management considers Adjusted EBITDA important in evaluating our business segments and the Company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental metric utilized by our management team to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business and our operating segments. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use these measures when analyzing our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of this measure and term may vary from other companies in our industry.
Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are representative of our core earnings. Adjusted EBITDA may also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with our intent of providing a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.
Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share
We define Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as Adjusted Net Income (defined above) divided by the weighted average diluted shares, which includes issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock plus the Class A LLC Units owned by the noncontrolling interest on an if-converted
basis.
Analysts, investors, and creditors may use this measure when analyzing our operating performance and comparability to peers. Adjusted Net Income is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our definition and use of this measure may vary from other companies in our industry.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, except for share data):
Reconciliation to GAAP
(1)
Change in Fair Value of Loans and Securities Held for Investment due to Assumption Changes-
This adjustment relates to changes in the significant market or model input components of the fair value for loans and securities which are held for investment, net of related liabilities. We include an adjustment for the significant market or model input components of the change in fair value because, while based on real observable and/or predicted changes in drivers of the valuation of assets, they may be mismatched in any given period with the actual change in the underlying economics or when they will be realized in actual cash flows. We do not record this change as a separate component in our financial records, but have generated this information based on modeling and certain assumptions. Changes in Fair Value of Loans and Securities Held for Investment due to Assumption Changes includes changes in fair value for the following mortgage servicing rights, loans held for investment, and related liabilities:
1. Reverse mortgage loans held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations, at fair value;
2. Mortgage loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, at fair value;
3. Mortgage loans held for investment, at fair value;
4. Debt Securities;
5. Mortgage servicing rights, at fair value;
6. HMBS related obligations, at fair value; and
7. Nonrecourse debt, at fair value.
The adjustment for changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment due to assumption changes is calculated based on changes in fair value associated with the above assets and liabilities calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding the period-to-date
estimated impact of the change in fair value attributable to current period additions and the change in fair value attributable to portfolio run-off,
net of hedge gains and losses and any securitization expenses incurred in securitizing our mortgage loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt. This adjustment represents changes in accounting estimates that are measured in accordance with US GAAP. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions due to factors such as changes in the economy, interest rates, secondary market pricing, prepayment assumptions, home prices or discrete events affecting specific borrowers, and such differences could be material. Accordingly, this number should be understood as an estimate and the actual adjustment could vary if our modeling is incorrect.
(2)
Change in Fair Value of Deferred Purchase Price Obligations
- We are obligated to pay contingent consideration to sellers of acquired businesses based on future performance of acquired businesses (Earnouts) as well as realization of tax benefits from the Business Combination (TRA Obligation). Change in fair value of deferred purchase price obligations represents impacts to revenue or expense due to changes in the estimated fair value of expected payouts as a result of changes in various assumptions, including future performance, timing and realization of tax benefits and discount rates.
(3)
Change in Fair Value of Minority Investments
-The adjustment to minority equity investments and debt investments is based on the change in fair value, which is an item that management believes should be excluded when discussing our ongoing and future operations. Although the change in fair value of minority equity investments and debt investments is a recurring part of our business, we believe the adjustment is appropriate as the fair value fluctuations from period to period make it difficult to analyze core-operating trends.
(4)
Certain non-recurring
costs relate to various one-time
expenses and adjustments that management believes should be excluded as these do not relate to a recurring part of the core business operations. These items include certain one-time
charges including estimated settlements for legal and regulatory matters, acquisition related expenses, share based compensation associated with the Business Combination, and
other one-time
charges. The Successor period of April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 includes $38.6 million of non-recurring
share based compensation primarily resulting from the immediate vesting portion of the Replacement RSU awards.
(5)
We applied a 26% effective tax rate to pre-tax
income and adjustments (excluding change in fair value of warrant liability and impairment of Component-2
goodwill-both considered permanent book to tax differences) for the respective period to determine the tax effect of net income (loss) and adjustments attributable to the noncontrolling interests and adjustments.
(6)
This is a component in the numerator of diluted net loss per share. See Note 38-Earnings Per Share.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Impact of the Business Combination
FoA is a holding company and has no material assets other than its direct and indirect ownership of Class A LLC Units. FoA has no independent means of generating revenue. FoA Equity may make distributions to its holders of Class A LLC Units, including FoA and the Continuing Unitholders, in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments under the TRAs and dividends, if any, declared by it. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of FoA Equity and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, the terms of our financing arrangements, including financing lines of credit and senior notes, contain covenants that may restrict FoA Equity and its subsidiaries from paying such distributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, one of our subsidiaries, FAM, is subject to various regulatory capital and minimum net worth requirements as a result of their mortgage origination and servicing activities. Further, FoA Equity is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of FoA Equity (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of FoA Equity are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to FoA Equity.
Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to obtain additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. Although we have no specific current plans to do so, if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses or dilution.
Tax Receivable Agreements
In connection with the Business Combination, concurrently with the Closing, the Company entered into TRA with certain owners of FoA Equity prior to the Business Combination (the “TRA Parties”). The TRAs generally provide for the payment by the Company to the TRA Parties of 85% of the cash tax benefits, if any, that the Company is deemed to realize as a result of (i) tax basis adjustments as a result of sales and exchanges of units in connection with or following the Business Combination and certain distributions with respect to units, (ii) the Company’s utilization of certain tax attributes attributable to Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Associates-NQ L.L.C., a Delaware limited partnership, Blocker GP, and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRAs, including tax benefits attributable to making payments under the TRAs. These tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) the depreciation and amortization deductions available to the Company and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state and local tax that the Company would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax
basis, and a court could sustain such challenge. The tax basis adjustments upon sales or exchanges of units for shares of Class A Common Stock and certain distributions with respect to Class A LLC Units may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets. Actual tax benefits realized by the Company may differ from tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreements as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the TRAs, including the use of an assumed weighted average state and local income tax rate to calculate tax benefits.
The payments that FoA may make under the TRAs are expected to be substantial. The payments under the TRAs are not conditioned upon continued ownership of FoA or FoA Equity by the Continuing Unitholders.
The Company accounts for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the TRAs arising from exchanges in connection with the Business Combination as follows:
•
records an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the exchange;
•
to the extent we estimate that the Company will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, the Company reduces the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and
•
initial measurement of the obligations is at fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequently, the liability will be remeasured at fair value each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recognized through earnings.
The Company records obligations under the TRAs resulting from exchanges subsequent to the Business Combination, as they occur, at the gross undiscounted amount of the expected future payments as an increase to the liability along with the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance (if any) with an offset to additional paid-in
capital.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a liability of $34.6 million related to its projected obligations under the TRA, which is included in deferred purchase price liabilities within payables and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Our primary sources of funds for liquidity include: (i) payments received from sale or securitization of loans; (ii) payments from the liquidation or securitization of our outstanding participating interests in loans; and (iii) advance and warehouse facilities, other secured borrowings and the unsecured senior notes.
Our primary uses of funds for liquidity include: (i) funding of borrower advances and draws on outstanding loans; (ii) originations of loans; (iii) payment of operating expenses; (iv) repayment of borrowings and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding indebtedness, and (v) distributions to shareholders for the estimated taxes on pass-through taxable income.
Our cash flow from operating activities when combined with net proceeds from our portfolio financing activities, as well as capacity through existing facilities, provide adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We rely on these facilities to fund operating activities. As the facilities mature, we anticipate renewal of these facilities will be achieved. Future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and, if necessary, future access to capital markets. We continue to optimize the use of balance sheet cash to avoid unnecessary interest carrying costs.
Cash Flows
As a result of the Business Combination, certain compensation expenses were considered to have been incurred “on the line”. These “on the line” expenses resulted in a decrease in cash on the opening balance sheet as of
April 1, 2021 when compared to the ending balance as of March 31, 2021. For the Successor period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, the beginning cash balance reflects the decrease in cash due to these expenses and, as such, these expenses have been appropriately excluded from the reconciliation to the ending cash balance.
The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (Successor), January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 (Predecessor), for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor) (in thousands):
Our cash decreased $163.2 million for the nine months from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (Successor), increased $113.7 million for the three months from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 (Predecessor), increased $156.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and increased $143.4 million for the year end December 31, 2019 (Predecessor). The decrease in cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) period was primarily driven distributions to members and CRNCI redemption related to the Business Combination, net cash invested in loans held for investment and MSRs, net of proceeds from nonrecourse and other secured financing, and acquisition of fixed assets and subsidiaries. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds on sales of mortgage loans held for sale, net of origination activity and net proceeds from other financing lines of credit.
Operating Cash Flow
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $(214.6) million for the nine months from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (Successor), $118.0 million for the three months from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 (Predecessor), $(686.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor).
Cash flows from operating activities improved $589.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor). The improvement was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from sale of loans held for sale, net of cash used for originations, partially offset by a decrease in Other assets, net. Proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale were $31.3 billion and $29.6 billion million during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), respectively. Cash used for originations of loans held for sale was $30.4 billion and $29.4 billion as of the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), respectively. Additionally, there was an approximate $20.0 million decrease in Net (loss) income adjusted for non-cash items. Net (loss) income decreased $1.7 billion, mostly offset by changes in non-cash items, such as gain on sale and other income from loans held for sale (change of $323 million), unrealized changes on loans, related obligations and derivatives (change of ($109 million)) and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (change of $1.4 billion).
Cash flows from operating activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor) compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor). The decrease was primarily attributable to $572.0 million decrease in net proceeds from sale of loans held for sale. We originated $29.4 billion in loans held for sale during the year compared to $15.6 billion in the prior year. Weighted average margins on originated loans were 3.88% for 2020 (Predecessor) compared to 2.80% for 2019 (Predecessor). The higher origination volumes were partially
offset by an increase in proceeds on the sale of loans held for sale and the corresponding gain on loans held for sale during the period. We sold $29.6 billion in loans during 2020 (Predecessor) compared to $16.4 billion in 2019 (Predecessor).
Investing Cash Flow
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,103.4 million for the nine months from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (Successor), $312.0 million for the three months from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 (Predecessor), $875.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and $2,025.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor).
The increase of $540.4 million in cash used in our investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor), compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), was primarily attributable to higher purchases/advances net of proceeds/payments on loans held for investment and higher cash used for acquisitions of subsidiaries and fixed assets. We originated $4.8 billion and $3.2 billion of reverse mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), respectively. Reverse mortgage loans originated consist of initial reverse mortgage loan borrowing amounts, and additional participations and accretions of reverse mortgage loans, including subsequent borrower draws, mortgage insurance premiums, service fees and other advances which we are able to subsequently pool into a security.
The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor), was primarily attributable to higher proceeds on mortgage loans held for investment during 2020 (Predecessor) compared to 2019 (Predecessor). We originated $3,186.7 million of reverse mortgage loans during 2020 (Predecessor) compared to $2,989.5 million in 2019 (Predecessor).
Financing Cash Flow
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,155.0 million for the nine months from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (Successor), $307.7 million for the three months from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 (Predecessor), $1,717.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and $2,067.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor).
The decrease of $255.2 million in cash provided by our financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor) period was primarily driven by a $707.3 decrease in proceeds from issuance, net of payments on nonrecourse debt and the $203 million payment to settle CRNCI. This was partially offset by an increase in net cash proceeds from HMBS obligations and other financing lines of credit.
The decrease in cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 (Predecessor), compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor), was primarily attributable to net proceeds from financing lines of credit of $246.3 million for 2020 (Predecessor) compared to $959.5 million for 2019 (Predecessor). The decrease in net proceeds provided from financing lines of credit was partially offset by higher proceeds on issuance of HMBS related obligations and nonrecourse debt. Additionally, in November 2020 (Predecessor), we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes, less debt issuance costs of $13.4 million and made member distributions of $380.4 million.
Financial Covenants
Our credit facilities contain various financial covenants, which primarily relate to required tangible net worth amounts, liquidity reserves, leverage ratio requirements, and profitability requirements. These covenants are
measured at our operating subsidiaries. As a result of impacts from the Business Combination, FAM was not in compliance with the lender adjusted tangible net worth quarterly and two-consecutive
quarter requirements by FNMA as detailed below. The Company received a waiver for the covenant violations from FNMA. As of
December 31, 2021, the Company had obtained waivers for these covenant violations and was in compliance with all other financial covenants.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the goodwill and intangible assets impairment and the impact to net income, FACo and FAM were not in compliance with profitability covenants as of December 31, 2021. The Company obtained waivers or revisions to terms of the affected covenants was in compliance with all other financial covenants as of December 31, 2021.
Seller/Servicer Financial Requirements
We are also subject to net worth, capital ratio and liquidity requirements established by FHA for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Seller/Servicers, and Ginnie Mae for single family issuers. In both cases, these requirements apply to our operating subsidiaries, FAM and FAR, which are licensed sellers/servicers of the respective GSEs. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with or had received waivers for all of our seller/servicer financial requirements for FHA and Ginnie Mae. For additional information see Note 34-Liquidity and Capital Requirements within the consolidated financial statements.
Minimum Net Worth
The minimum net worth requirement for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is defined as follows:
•
Base of $2.5 million plus 25 basis points of outstanding UPB for total loans serviced.
•
Tangible Net Worth comprises of total equity less goodwill, intangible assets, affiliate receivables and certain pledged assets.
The minimum net worth requirement for Ginnie Mae is defined as follows:
•
The sum of (i) base of $2.5 million plus 35 basis points of the issuer’s total single-family effective outstanding obligations, and (ii) base of $5 million plus 1% of the total effective HMBS outstanding obligations.
•
Tangible Net Worth is defined as total equity less goodwill, intangible assets, affiliate receivables and certain pledged assets. Effective for fiscal year 2020, under the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide, the issuers will no longer be permitted to include deferred tax assets when computing the minimum net worth requirement.
Minimum Capital Ratio
•
In addition to the minimum net worth requirement, we are also required to hold a ratio of Tangible Net Worth to Total Assets (excluding HMBS securitizations) greater than 6%.
•
FAR received a permanent waiver for the minimum outstanding capital requirements from Ginnie Mae.
Minimum Liquidity
The minimum liquidity requirement for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is defined as follows:
•
3.5 basis points of total Agency Mortgage Servicing, plus
•
Incremental 200 basis points times the sum of the following:
•
The total UPB of nonperforming (90 or more days delinquent) Agency Mortgage Servicing that is not in forbearance, plus
•
The total UPB of nonperforming (90 or more days delinquent) Agency Mortgage Servicing that is in forbearance and which were delinquent at the time it entered forbearance, plus
•
30% of the UPB of nonperforming (90 or more days delinquent) Agency Mortgage Servicing that is in forbearance and which were current at the time it entered forbearance
•
This liquidity must only be maintained to the extent this sum exceeds 6% of the total Agency Mortgage Servicing UPB.
•
Allowable assets for liquidity may include: cash and cash equivalents (unrestricted), available for sale or held for trading investment grade securities (e.g., Agency MBS, Obligations of GSEs, US Treasury Obligations); and unused/available portion of committed servicing advance lines.
The minimum liquidity requirement for Ginnie Mae is defined as follows:
•
Maintain liquid assets equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 10 basis points of our outstanding single-family MBS.
•
Maintain liquid assets equal to at least 20% of our net worth requirement for HECM MBS.
Summary of Certain Indebtedness
The following description is a summary of certain material provisions of our outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, our debt obligations were approximately $16.9 billion. This summary does not restate the terms of our outstanding indebtedness in its entirety, nor does it describe all of the material terms of our indebtedness.
Warehouse Lines of Credit
Mortgage facilities
As of December 31, 2021, our Mortgage Originations segment had $3.6 billion in warehouse lines of credit collateralized by first lien mortgages with $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount drawn through 14 funding facility arrangements with 13 active lenders. These facilities are generally structured as master repurchase agreements under which ownership of the related eligible loans is temporarily transferred to a lender or as participation arrangements pursuant to which the lender acquires a participation interest in the related eligible loans. The funds advanced to us are generally repaid using the proceeds from the sale or securitization of the loans to, or pursuant to, programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae or to private secondary market investors, although prior payment may be required based on, among other things, certain breaches of representations and warranties or other events of default.
When we draw on these facilities, we generally must transfer and pledge eligible loans to the lender, and comply with various financial and other covenants. The facilities generally have one-year
terms and expire at various times during 2022 through 2023. Under our facilities, we generally transfer the loans at an advance rate less than the principal balance or fair value of the loans (the “haircut”), which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender. Since the advances to us are generally for less than 100% of the principal balance of the loans, we
are required to use working capital to fund the remaining portion of the principal balance of the loans. The amount of the advance that is provided under the various facilities ranges from 86% to 100% of the market value or principal balance of the loans. Upon expiration, management believes it will either renew its existing warehouse facilities or obtain sufficient additional lines of credit. The interest rate on all outstanding facilities is LIBOR plus a spread, the prime rate plus a spread or an alternative short term index plus a spread.
The following table presents additional information about our Mortgage Originations segment’s warehouse facilities as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
Reverse mortgage facilities
As of December 31, 2021, our Reverse Originations segment had $1.3 billion in warehouse lines of credit collateralized by first lien mortgages with $0.7 billion million aggregate principal amount drawn through 7 funding facility arrangements with 7 active lenders. These facilities are generally structured as master repurchase agreements under which ownership of the related eligible loans is temporarily transferred to a lender, or as participation arrangements pursuant to which the lender acquires a participation interest in the related eligible loans. The funds advanced to us are generally repaid using the proceeds from the sale or securitization of the loans to, or pursuant to, programs sponsored by Ginnie Mae or private secondary market investors, although prior payment may be required based on, among other things, certain breaches of representations and warranties or other events of default.
When we draw on these warehouse lines of credit, we generally must transfer and pledge eligible loans, and comply with various financial and other covenants. The facilities generally have one-year
terms and expire at various times during 2022 through 2023. Under our facilities, we generally transfer the loans at a haircut which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender. Since the advances to us are generally for less than the acquisition cost of the loans, we are required to use working capital to fund the remaining portion of the funding required for the loan. The amount of the advance that is provided under the various facilities ranges from 90 to 104% of the market value or principal balance of the loans. Upon expiration, management believes it will either renew its existing facilities or obtain sufficient additional lines of credit. The interest rate on all outstanding facilities is LIBOR plus applicable margin.
The following table presents additional information about our Reverse Origination segment’s warehouse facilities as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
Commercial loan facilities
As of December 31, 2021, our Commercial Originations segment had $0.5 billion in warehouse lines of credit collateralized by first lien mortgages and encumbered agricultural loans with $0.2 billion aggregate principal amount drawn through 4 funding facility arrangements with 4 active lenders. These facilities are either structured as master repurchase agreements under which ownership of the related eligible loans is temporarily transferred to
a lender, as loan and security agreements pursuant to which the related eligible assets are pledged as collateral for the loan from the related lender or are collateralized by first lien loans or crop loans. The funds advanced to us are generally repaid using the proceeds from the sale or securitization of the loans to private secondary market investors, although prior payment may be required based on, among other things, certain breaches of representations and warranties or other events of default.
When we draw on these facilities, we must transfer and pledge eligible loan collateral, and comply with various financial and other covenants. The facilities generally have one-year
terms and expire at various times during 2022 through 2023. Under our facilities, we generally transfer the loans at a haircut, which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender. One of our warehouse lines of credit is guaranteed and another warehouse line of credit is partially guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Finance of America Holdings LLC (“FAH”), the parent holding company to the commercial lending business. Since the advances to us are generally for less than 100% of the principal balance of the loans, we are required to use working capital to fund the remaining portion of the principal balance of the loans. The amount of the advance that is provided under the various facilities generally ranges from 70% to 85% of the principal balance of the loans. Upon expiration, management believes it will either renew its existing facilities or obtain sufficient additional lines of credit. The interest rate on all outstanding facilities is LIBOR plus a spread, the prime rate plus a spread or an alternative short term index plus a spread.
The following table presents additional information about our Commercial Origination segment’s warehouse facilities as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
General
With respect to each of our warehouse facilities, we pay certain up-front
and/or ongoing fees which can be based on our utilization of the facility. In some instances, loans held by a lender for a contractual period exceeding 45 to 60 calendar days after we originate such loans are subject to additional fees and interest rates.
Certain of our warehouse facilities contain sub-limits
for “wet” loans, which allow us to finance loans for a minimal period of time prior to delivery of the note collateral to the lender. “Wet” loans are loans for which the collateral custodian has not yet received the related loan documentation. “Dry” loans are loans for which all the sale documentation has been completed at the time of funding. Wet loans are held by a lender for a contractual period, typically between five and ten business days and are subject to a reduction in the advance amount.
Interest is generally payable at the time the loan is settled off the line or monthly in arrears and principal is payable upon receipt of loan sale proceeds or transfer of a loan to another line of credit. The facilities may also require the outstanding principal to be repaid if a loan remains on the line longer than a contractual period of time, which ranges from 45 to 365 calendar days.
Interest on our warehouse facilities vary by facility and may depend on the type of asset that is being financed. The interest rate on all outstanding facilities is LIBOR plus a spread, the prime rate plus a spread or an alternative short term index plus a spread.
Loans financed under certain of our warehouse facilities are subject to changes in fair value and margin calls. The fair value of our loans depends on a variety of economic conditions, including interest rates and market demand for loans. Under certain facilities, if the fair value of the underlying loans declines below the outstanding
asset balance on such loans or if the UPB of such loans falls below a threshold related to the repurchase price for such loans, we could be required to (i) repay cash in an amount that cures the margin deficit or (ii) supply additional eligible assets or rights as collateral for the underlying loans to compensate for the margin deficit. Certain warehouse facilities allow for the remittance of cash back to us if the value of the loan exceeds the principal balance.
Our warehouse facilities require each of our borrowing subsidiaries to comply with various customary operating and financial covenants, including, without limitation, the following tests:
•
minimum tangible or adjusted tangible net worth;
•
maximum leverage ratio of total liabilities (which may include off-balance
sheet liabilities) or indebtedness to tangible or adjusted tangible net worth;
•
minimum liquidity or minimum liquid assets; and
•
minimum net income or pre-tax
net income.
In the event we fail to comply with the covenants contained in any of our warehouse lines of credit, or otherwise were to default under the terms of such agreements, we may be restricted from paying dividends, reducing or retiring our equity interests, making investments or incurring more debt.
As a result of impacts from the Business Combination, FAM was not in compliance with the second quarter 2021 lender adjusted tangible net worth quarterly requirement and the second and third quarter 2021 two-consecutive
quarter requirements by FNMA. The Company received a waiver for the covenant violations from FNMA for both the second and third quarter of 2021.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the goodwill and intangible assets impairment and the impact to net income, FACo and FAM were not in compliance with profitability requirements as of December 31, 2021. The Company obtained waivers or amendments to the terms of the affected covenants and in certain cases, elected to terminate the related financing transactions in accordance with their respective terms in lieu of seeking a waiver or amendment. The Company was in compliance with all other financial covenants as of December 31, 2021.
Other Secured Lines of Credit
As of December 31, 2021, our Mortgage, Reverse, and Commercial Originations segments collectively had $1.0 billion in additional secured facilities with $0.7 billion aggregate principal amount drawn through credit agreements or master repurchase agreements with 13 funding facility arrangements and 12 active lenders. These facilities are secured by, among other things, eligible asset-backed securities, MSRs, and HECM tails. In certain instances, these assets are subject to existing first lien warehouse financing, in which case these facilities (i.e., mezzanine facilities) are secured by the equity in these assets exceeding first lien warehouse financing. One of our facilities was with Podium Mortgage Capital, LLC, who acts as a lender to us and is an affiliate of one our shareholders, Blackstone, Inc. These facilities are generally structured as master repurchase agreements under which ownership of the related eligible assets are temporarily transferred to a lender. The funds advanced to us are generally repaid using the proceeds from the sale or securitization of the underlying assets or distribution from underlying securities, although prior payment may be required based on, among other things, certain breaches of representations and warranties or other events of default.
When we draw on these facilities, we generally must transfer and pledge eligible assets to the lender, and comply with various financial and other covenants. Under our facilities, we generally transfer the assets at a haircut which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender. Three of these facilities are guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, FAH, the parent holding company to the mortgage, reverse mortgage and commercial lending businesses, and one of these also benefits from a pledge of equity of our wholly-owned subsidiary, FAR. Upon expiration, management believes it will either renew these facilities or obtain sufficient additional lines of credit.
The following table presents additional information about our other secured lines of credit for our Mortgage, Reverse and Commercial Originations segments as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
We pay certain up-front
and ongoing fees based on our utilization with respect to many of these facilities. We pay commitment fees based upon the limit of the facility and unused fees are paid if utilization falls below a certain amount.
Interest is payable either at the time the loan or securities are settled off the line or monthly in arrears and principal is payable upon receipt of asset sale proceeds, principal distributions on the underlying pledged securities or transfer of assets to another line of credit and upon the maturity of the facility.
Under these facilities, we are generally required to comply with various customary operating and financial covenants. The financial covenants are similar to those under the warehouse lines of credit. During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the goodwill and intangible assets impairment and the impact to net income, FACo and FAM were not in compliance with profitability requirements as of December 31, 2021. The Company obtained waivers or revisions to terms of the affected covenants for the covenant violations and was in compliance with all other financial covenants as of December 31, 2021.
HMBS related obligations
FAR is an approved issuer of HMBS securities that are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and collateralized by participation interests in HECMs insured by the FHA. We originate HECMs insured by the FHA. Participations in the HECMs are pooled into HMBS securities which are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained. We have determined that loan transfers in the HMBS program do not meet the accounting definition of a participating interest because of the servicing requirements in the product that require the issuer/servicer to absorb some level of interest rate risk, cash flow timing risk and incidental credit risk due to the buyout of HECM assets as discussed below. As a result, the transfers of the HECMs do not qualify for sale accounting, and we, therefore, account for these transfers as financings. Holders of participating interests in the HMBS have no recourse against assets other than the underlying HECM loans, remittances, or collateral on those loans while they are in the securitization pools, except for standard representations and warranties and our contractual obligation to service the HECMs and the HMBS.
Remittances received on the reverse loans, if any, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate owned and our funds used to repurchase reverse loans are used to reduce the HMBS related obligations by making payments to the securitization pools, which then remit the payments to the beneficial interest holders of the HMBS. The maturity of the HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. As an HMBS issuer, FAR assumes certain obligations related to each security it issues. The most significant obligation is the requirement to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once they reach certain limits set at loan origination for the maximum UPB allowed. Performing repurchased loans are generally conveyed to the HUD and nonperforming repurchased loans are generally liquidated in accordance with program requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had HMBS-related borrowings of $10.4 billion and HECMs pledged as collateral to the pools of $10.6 billion, both carried at fair value.
Additionally, as the servicer of reverse loans, we are obligated to fund additional borrowing capacity primarily in the form of undrawn lines of credit on floating rate reverse loans. We rely upon our operating cash flows to fund
these additional borrowings on a short-term basis prior to securitization. The additional borrowings are generally securitized within 30 days after funding. The obligation to fund these additional borrowings could have a significant impact on our liquidity.
Nonrecourse Debt
We securitize and issue interests in pools of loans that are not eligible for the Ginnie Mae securitization program. These include reverse mortgage loans that were previously repurchased out of a HMBS pool (“HECM Buyouts”). fix & flip securitized loans, and non FHA-insured
non-agency
reverse mortgages (“non-agency
reverse mortgages-Securitized”). The transactions provide investors with the ability to invest in these pools of assets. The transactions provide us with access to liquidity for these assets, ongoing servicing fees, and potential residual returns for the residual securities we retain at the time of securitization. The transactions are structured as secured borrowings with the loan assets and liabilities, respectively, included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as mortgage loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, at fair value, and nonrecourse debt, at fair value. As of December 31, 2021, we had nonrecourse debt-related borrowings of $6.1 billion.
Nonrecourse MSR Financing Liability, at Fair Value
The Company entered into nonrevolving facility commitments with various investors to pay an amount based on monthly cashflows received in respect of servicing fees generated from certain of the Company’s originated or acquired MSRs. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to pay an amount to these parties equal to excess servicing and ancillary fees related to the identified MSRs in exchange for an upfront payment equal to the entire purchase price of the identified acquired or originated MSRs. These transactions are accounted for as financings under ASC 470, Debt
.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had an outstanding advance against this commitment of $139.0 million, with a fair value of $142.4 million, for the purchase of MSRs. The Company accrued for excess servicing and ancillary fees against the outstanding advances in the amount of $15.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, to these investors for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020.
Senior Unsecured Notes
On November 5, 2020, Finance of America Funding LLC, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2025. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a rate of 7.875% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 beginning on May 15, 2021. The 7.875% senior unsecured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by FoA and each of FoA’s material existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than Finance of America Funding LLC and subsidiaries that cannot guarantee the notes for tax, contractual or regulatory reasons).
At any time prior to November 15, 2022, Finance of America Funding LLC may redeem some or all of the 7.875% senior unsecured notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable premium as of the redemption date under the terms of the indenture and accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price during each of the twelve-month periods following November 15, 2022, November 15, 2023, and at any time after November 15, 2024 is 103.938%, 101.969% and 100.000%, respectively, of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. At any time prior to November 15, 2022, Finance of America Funding LLC may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to 107.875% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes redeemed, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the holders of the 7.875% senior unsecured notes will have the right to require Finance of America Funding LLC to make an offer to repurchase each holder’s 7.875% senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The consummation of the Business Combination did not result in a change of control for purposes of Finance of America Funding LLC’s 7.875% senior unsecured notes.
The 7.875% senior unsecured notes contain covenants limiting, among other things, Finance of America Funding LLC’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain types of additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, incur liens, make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Finance of America Funding LLC’s assets. These incurrence based covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications (including any relevant exceptions for the Business Combination). Many of these covenants will cease to apply with respect to the 7.875% senior unsecured notes during any time that the 7.875% senior unsecured notes have investment grade ratings from either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Inc. and no default with respect to the 7.875% senior unsecured notes has occurred and is continuing. The Company was in compliance with all required covenants related to the Notes as of December 31, 2021.
FoA’s existing owners or their affiliated entities, including Blackstone and Brian L. Libman, FoA’s founder and chairman, purchased notes in the offering in an aggregate principal amount of $135.0 million.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table provides a summary of obligations and commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands). The information below does not give effect to the Business Combination or the use of proceeds therefrom.
(1)
Nonrecourse MSR financing liability is excluded from this balance. See below for additional details related to the nonrecourse MSR financing liability.
In addition to the above contractual obligations, we have also been involved with several securitizations of HECM loans, which were structured as secured borrowings. These structures resulted in us carrying the securitized loans on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and recognizing the asset-backed certificates acquired by third parties as HMBS obligations. The timing of the principal payments on this nonrecourse debt is dependent on the payments received on the underlying mortgage loans and liquidation of real estate owned REO. The outstanding principal balance of loans held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations was $9,849.8 million as of December 31, 2021.
In addition to the above contractual obligations, we have also been involved in the sale of a portion of the excess servicing and/or an agreement to pay certain amounts based on excess servicing cashflows generated on our
owned mortgage servicing rights. These transactions are treated as structured financings in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition with the recognized proceeds being recorded as nonrecourse MSR financing liability. The timing of the payments of the nonrecourse MSR financing liability is dependent on the payments received on the underlying mortgage servicing rights.
The payments that we will be required to make under the TRAs that was entered into in connection with the Business Combination may be significant and are not reflected in the contractual obligations tables set forth above.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTMATES
Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In particular, we have identified several policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements. These policies relate to fair value measurements, particularly those determined to be Level 3 as discussed in Note 5-Fair Value within the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the judgment, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition. Fair value measurements considered to be Level 3 representing estimated values based on significant unobservable inputs include (i) the valuation of loans held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations at fair value (ii) the valuation of loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, at fair value (iii) the valuation of loans held for investment, at fair value (iv) the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, at fair value (v) the valuation of HMBS related obligations, at fair value and (vi) valuation of nonrecourse debt, at fair value.
Fair Value Measurements
Reverse Mortgage Loans Held for Investment, at Fair Value
We have elected to account for all outstanding reverse mortgage loans held for investment at fair value. Outstanding reverse mortgage loans held for investment, at fair value, include originated reverse mortgage loans that are expected to be sold or securitized in the secondary market, reverse mortgage loans that were previously securitized into either an HMBS or private securitization, or repurchased reverse loans out of Ginnie Mae securitization pools.
We have determined that HECM loans transferred under the current Ginnie Mae HMBS securitization program do not meet the requirements for sale accounting and are not derecognized upon date of transfer. The Ginnie Mae HMBS securitization program includes certain terms that do not meet the participating interest requirements and require or provide an option for the Company to reacquire the loans prior to maturity. Due to these terms, the transfer of the loans does not meet the requirements of sale accounting. As a result, the Company accounts for HECM loans transferred into HMBS securitizations as secured borrowings and continues to recognize the loans as held for investment, along with the corresponding liability for the HMBS related obligations.
Non-agency
reverse mortgage loans are loans designated for homeowners aged 62 or older with higher priced homes. The minimum home value is $0.5 million and the maximum loan amount is $4.0 million. Non-agency
reverse mortgage loans are not insured by the FHA and will not be placed into a Ginnie Mae HMBS. However, the Company may transfer or pledge these assets as collateral for securitized nonrecourse debt obligations.
Reverse mortgage loans held for investment, at fair value, also include claims receivable that have been submitted to HUD awaiting reimbursement. These amounts are recorded net of amounts the Company does not expect to recover through outstanding claims.
As an issuer of HMBS, we are required to repurchase reverse loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM is equal to or greater than 98% of the maximum claim amount (“MCA”) (referred to as unpoolable loans). Performing repurchased loans are conveyed to HUD and payment is received from HUD typically within 75 days of repurchase. Nonperforming repurchased loans are generally liquidated through foreclosure, subsequent sale of the real estate owned, and claim submissions to HUD. We recognize reverse mortgage loans held for investment at fair value with all changes in fair value recorded as a charge or credit to net fair value gains on loans and related obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We estimate the fair value of these loans using a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value. The cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in the model are based on various factors, with the key assumptions being prepayment, borrower mortality, home price appreciation, loss severity, loss frequency, loan to value ratio, and discount rate assumptions.
Commercial Loans Held for Investment, at Fair Value
We have elected to account for all outstanding commercial loans held for investment at fair value. Outstanding commercial loans include originated Fix & Flip loans, consisting of short-term loans for individual real estate investors, with terms ranging from 9-24
months for which we intend to hold to maturity.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value
We have elected to account for all mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. Mortgage loans held for sale represent mortgage loans originated by the Company and held until sold to secondary market investors. Changes in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale are included in gain on sale of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
The fair value of loans held for sale that trade in active secondary markets is estimated using Level 2 measurements derived from mortgage loans that can be sold to the Agencies, which are valued predominantly by published forward agency prices. This will also include all non-agency
loans where recently negotiated market prices for the loan pool exist with a counterparty (which approximates fair value), or quoted market prices for similar loans are available. A portion of our mortgage loans held for sale consist of reverse mortgage loans held for sale which is estimated using Level 3 measurements derived from expected proceeds from sale of the underlying property and any additional HUD claim proceeds.
Changes in economic or other relevant conditions could cause our assumptions with respect to market prices of securities backed by similar mortgage loans to be different than our estimates. Increases in the market yields of similar mortgage loans result in a lower mortgage loans held for sale fair value.
Mortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value
We account for retained and acquired MSRs in accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing
. Under this method, servicing assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded through earnings in the period of the change as a component of fee income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The fair value of the MSRs is based upon the present value of the expected future net cash flows related to servicing these loans. For MSRs that we have current commitments to sell to third parties, the fair value is based on the outstanding commitment price. We receive a base servicing fee based on the remaining outstanding principal balances of the loans, which are collected from borrowers on a monthly basis. We determine the fair value of the MSRs by the use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates prepayment speeds, delinquencies, discount rate, ancillary revenues and other assumptions (including costs to service) that management believes are consistent with the assumptions other similar market participants use in valuing the MSRs.
HMBS Obligations, at Fair Value
We have elected to account for all outstanding HMBS obligations at fair value. The HMBS obligation considers the obligation to pass FHA insured cash flows through to the beneficial interest holders (repayment of the secured borrowings) of the HMBS securities and the servicer and issuer obligations of the Company.
As issuer and servicer of the HMBS security, we are required to perform various servicing activities, including processing borrower payments, maintaining borrower contact, facilitating borrower advances, generating borrower statements, and facilitating loss-mitigation strategies in an attempt to keep defaulted borrowers in their homes.
We recognize HMBS obligations at fair value with all changes in fair value recorded as a charge or credit to net fair value gains on loans and related obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We estimate the fair value of these loans using a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value. The cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in the model are based on various factors, with the key assumptions being prepayment, borrower mortality, and discount rate assumptions.
Nonrecourse Debt, at Fair Value
We have elected to account for all outstanding nonrecourse debt at fair value. We issued nonrecourse debt securities, at fair value, secured by loans made to real estate investors, which provides the Company with access to liquidity for the loans and ongoing management fees. The principal and interest on the outstanding certificates are paid using the cash flows from the underlying securitized loans, which serve as collateral for the debt.
We recognize our outstanding nonrecourse debt at fair value with all changes in fair value recorded as a charge or credit to net fair value gains on loans and related obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We estimate the fair value of these loans using a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value. The cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in the model are based on various factors, with the key assumptions being prepayment, borrower mortality, and discount rate assumptions.
We use various internal financial models that use market participant data to value these loans. These models are complex and use asset specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates. In addition, the modeling requirements of loans are complex because of the high number of variables that drive cash flows associated with the loans. Even if the general accuracy of our valuation models is validated, valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models. On a quarterly basis, we obtain external market valuations from independent third party valuation experts in order to validate the reasonableness of our internal valuation.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
Acquisitions that qualify as a business combination are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of consideration transferred for an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their fair value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets, net acquired under a business combination.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, we complete valuation procedures for an acquisition to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuation procedures require management to make assumptions and apply significant judgment to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the estimates or assumptions used should significantly change, the resulting differences could materially affect the fair value of net assets. We estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired generally through a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis (the income approach) and an analysis of comparable market transactions (the market approach). For the income approach, we base the inputs and assumptions used to develop these estimates on a market participant perspective which include estimates of projected revenue, discount rates, economic lives and income tax rates, among others, all of which require significant management judgment. For the market approach, we apply judgment to identify the most comparable market transactions to the transaction. Finite lived intangible assets, net, which are primarily comprised of customer relationships and technology, are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, or on a basis more representative of the time pattern over which the benefit is derived, and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1st and monitored for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using a market approach including significant assumptions, such as, discount rate, terminal factors, market multiples, and control premiums, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss.
