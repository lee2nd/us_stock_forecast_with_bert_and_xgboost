Plan of Operation
We discontinued our business operations comprising the TOR-technology in March 2021, when the Company’s subsidiary which held substantially was transferred to Capital Vario pursuant to shareholder approval, in complete satisfaction of all indebtedness of the Company, and have no current business activities plan of operation.
We now intend to focus our efforts on finding a new business opportunity for the benefit of our shareholders.
Results of Operations
Year Ended March 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2021
General and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, were $49,793, compared to $74,841 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of $25,048. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was related to an overall increase professional fees related to filing requirements in connection with the ongoing financial reporting obligations as well additional profession fees incurred related to the sale of our subsidiaries and assets during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we sold the operations related to our TOR-technology resulting in a loss on the sale. As a result we reclassed these operations to discontinued operations. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we had a loss of $291,820 from discontinued operations due to the loss on the sale of the subsidiaries, significant research and development expenditures related to the development the Tornado M, increased general and administrative expenses related to the expanded operations which included the leasing of a facility, etc. There were no such losses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Current assets at March 31, 2022, included $422 in cash, a decrease of $10,453 from total current assets of $10,875 at March 31, 2021 which included cash of $10,875.
At March 31, 2022, we had a negative working capital of $58,418, as compared to negative working capital of $8,625, at March 31, 2021.
Capital Resources
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, operating activities used cash of $49,454, as compared to $201,730 in net cash used for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The reduction was due to decrease in operations.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, investing activities used cash of $0, as compared to $114,748 cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. In 2021, the majority of the amount used related to additional capital assets purchased for the development of our Tornado M.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, financing activities provided cash of $39,000, as compared to $326,310 in cash provided for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. In fiscal year 2021, we received proceeds from a subscription receivable of $165,000 in connection with sales of our common stock and the common stock of our subsidiary which were sold in fiscal 2020. In addition, we received short-term advances from related parties of $39,000 and $181,310 related to fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The proceeds were used to further the development of our Tornado M and to fund operations.
We intend to fund future operations for the next 12 months through cash flows generated from operations, current cash on hand and the proceeds from advances from a related entity. If these cash flows are not sufficient to fund operations, we may be required to raise capital through either a debt or equity financing. These contributions are expected to satisfy amounts in accounts payable and potentially be used for operations. Currently, we cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If, after utilizing the existing sources of capital available to us, further capital needs are identified and if we are not successful in obtaining the required financing, we may be forced to curtail our existing or planned future operations. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. We believe our plans will enable us to continue our current operations for a period in excess of one year from the date of our most recent balance sheet.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had no off-balance sheet arrangements for the two fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021.
