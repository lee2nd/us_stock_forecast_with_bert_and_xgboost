Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. and elsewhere in this report.
COVID-19 Impact on Economy and Business Environment
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the United States have adversely affected the demand for our products and services by our customers and from patients of our customers as a result of quarantines, facility closures and social distancing measures put into effect. These restrictions have adversely affected the Company’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company (a) has accelerated its research and development activities; (b) is seeking to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to support working capital requirements; and (c) continues to take steps to stabilize and increase revenues from the sale of its products.
There is no assurance as to when the adverse impact to the United States and worldwide economies resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak will be eliminated, if at all, and whether any new or recurring pandemic outbreaks will occur again in the future causing a similar or worse devastating impact to the United States and worldwide economies or our business.
Results of Operations
Fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 as compared to fiscal year ended October 31, 2020
Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2021 were $5,597,487, compared to revenues of $3,055,776 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in revenues during the year ended October 31, 2021 of $2,541,711 (83.2%) was primarily the result of the Company being able to realize an increase of approximately 103.7% (approximately $2,849,000) in unit sales of its products during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended October 31, 2020, partially offset from a decrease of approximately 10.0% (approximately $308,000) in the average sales prices for the products sold during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the average sales prices realized on products sold during the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in the units sold was partly attributable to favorable responses to the Company’s sales and marketing efforts establishing greater market awareness, the introduction of new and more advanced product offerings and increased research and development efforts which provided customers with greater comfort in the Company’s products and ability to better address potential market uncertainty regarding anticipated FDA regulations. The decrease in the average sales prices realized on products sold during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended October 31, 2020 was due to volume pricing discounts for large orders of the Company’s medical grade product offerings and the increase in the sales of the Company’s aesthetic product offerings which are sold at lower prices than the Company’s medical grade product offerings.
Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the year ended October 31, 2021 were $547,881, compared with cost of revenues of $398,606 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in the cost of revenues during the year ended October 31, 2021 of $149,275 (37.4%) compared with the year ended October 31, 2020 was due to an increase in the amount of units sold of 103.7% (approximately $278,886) during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended October 31, 2020, partially offset from the reduction in the cost of units sold of 32.5% (approximately ($129,611) during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared to costs of units sold during the year ended October 31, 2020, which as described above was primarily the result of the Company’s increase in the sales of the Company’s aesthetic product offerings during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared to the year ended October 31, 2020 which have a lower cost of revenue than the Company’s medical grade product offerings.
Gross Profit. Our gross profit for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $5,049,606 (90.1% of revenues), compared with gross profit of $2,657,170 (87.0% of revenues) for the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in gross profit during the year ended October 31, 2021 was the result of higher amount of units sold and lower cost of units sold during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared to the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in the units sold was partly attributable to favorable responses to the Company’s sales and marketing efforts establishing greater market awareness and the introduction of new and more advanced product offerings. The lower cost of units sold was due to the Company’s increase in the sales of the Company’s aesthetic product offerings during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared to the year ended October 31, 2020 which have a lower cost of revenue than the Company’s medical grade product offerings.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended October 31, 2021 were $17,793,709, compared with $15,095,111 for the year ended October 31, 2020, an increase of $2,698,598 (17.9%). The increase in the general and administrative expenses for the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended October 31, 2020 was primarily the result of increased research and development costs of approximately $886,000, increased commissions due from sales of the Company’s products of approximately $915,000, increased payroll and consulting costs of approximately $1,400,000, increased professional fees of approximately $384,000, increased office related costs of approximately $141,000 and approximately $209,000 of increased laboratory related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation costs to advisors, consultants and administrative staff totaling approximately $1,262,000. The increase in research and development costs, payroll and consulting costs, professional fees and laboratory related expenses was the result of the Company’s expansion of its research and development activities primarily relating to the filing and approval of IND applications and the performance of clinical trials and public company compliance related costs during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended 2020. The increase in commissions was the result in the increase in revenues sales during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended 2020. The decrease in stock-based compensation costs was the result of a reduction in the amount of shares issued as stock compensation during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared with the year ended 2020, partially offset from the increase in the costs attributable to the shares issued as stock compensation based on increases in the Company’s share price during periods that the stock compensation was granted (average cost of shares granted during the year ended October 31, 2021 was $0.062 versus average cost of shares granted during the year ended October 31, 2020 of $0.029).
Other Income (Expense) Other expense, net, for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $12,457, compared with other expense, net, of $145,027 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The decrease in other expense, net, of $132,570 was principally the result of reduced interest costs during the year ended October 31, 2021 of approximately $118,350 in connection with the amount of the discount to the fair value of common stock associated with the conversion of a funding facility into equity and the reduction in interest expense of approximately $25,000 associated with such funding facility. These costs occurred during the year ended October 31, 2020 and did not occur during the year ended October 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The following table summarizes the sources and uses of cash for the periods stated. The Company held no cash equivalents for any of the periods presented:
During the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company used cash in operating activities of $2,609,085, compared to $1,812,499 for the year ended October 31, 2020, an increase in cash used of $796,586. The increase in cash used in operating activities was due to the increase in the general and administrative expenses during the year ended October 31, 2021 after adjusting for non-cash charges (mostly related to stock-based compensation), resulting from increased payroll and consulting costs and laboratory related expenses in connection with the Company’s expansion of its research and development activities during the year ended October 31, 2021, partially offset from the increase in revenues and gross profit during the year ended October 31, 2021.
During the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company had cash used in investing activities of $496,011, compared to cash used in investing activities of $138,694 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities of $357,317 was due primarily due the Company’s leasehold improvements associated with the new lab facility in Basalt, CO of $406,709, partially offset from lower capital expenditures for the acquisition of additional fixed assets required in connection with the Company’s laboratory operations during the year ended October 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2020.
During the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company had cash provided by financing activities of $2,622,869 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2,409,433 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $213,436 was due to increases in proceeds from the sale of equity securities and convertible notes of approximately $512,000, decreases in repayments of outstanding debt obligations of approximately $96,900, and reduced payments on finance leases of approximately $9,000, partially offset from reduced proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable of $400,000 during the year ended October 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2020.
Capital Resources
The Company has historically relied on the sale of debt or equity securities, the restructuring of debt obligations and/or the issuance and/or exchange of equity securities to meet the shortfall in cash to fund its operations.

Going Concern Consideration
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has had limited revenues since its inception. The Company incurred operating losses of $12,744,103 for the year ended October 31, 2021. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $41,624,749 at October 31, 2021. The Company had a negative working capital position of $3,609,174 at October 31, 2021.
New United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulations which were announced in November 2017 and which became effective beginning in May 2021 (postponed from November 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic) require that the sale of products that fall under Section 351 of the Public Health Services Act pertaining to marketing traditional biologics and human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”) can only be sold pursuant to an approved biologics license application (“BLA”). The Company has not obtained any opinion or ruling regarding the Company’s operations and whether the processing, sales and distribution of the products it currently produces would be subject to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s.
In addition to the above, the adverse public health developments and economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have adversely affected the demand for our products and services by our customers and from patients of our customers as a result of quarantines, facility closures and social distancing measures put into effect in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak and which currently still continue to have a negative impact to our business and the economy.
As a result of the above, the Company’s efforts to establish a stabilized source of sufficient revenues to cover operating costs has yet to be achieved and ultimately may prove to be unsuccessful unless (a) the Company’s ability to process, sell and distribute the products currently being produced or developed in the future are not restricted, (b) the United States economy resumes to pre-COVID-19 conditions and/or (c) additional sources of working capital through operations or debt and/or equity financings are realized. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management anticipates that the Company will remain dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund ongoing operating expenses and research and development costs related to development of new products and to perform required clinical studies in connection with the sale of its products. The Company does not have any assets to pledge for the purpose of borrowing additional capital. In addition, the Company relies on its ability to produce and sell products it manufactures that are subject to changing technology and regulations that it currently sells and distributes to its customers. The Company’s current market capitalization, common stock liquidity and available authorized shares may hinder its ability to raise equity proceeds. The Company anticipates that future sources of funding, if any, will therefore be costly and dilutive, if available at all.
In view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs, recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet assumes that (1) the Company is able to continue to produce products or obtain products under supply arrangements which are in compliance with current and future regulatory guidelines, (2) the effects of the COVID-19 crisis resume to pre-COVID-19 market conditions, (3) the Company will be able to establish a stabilized source of revenues, including efforts to expand sales internationally and the development of new product offerings and/or designations of products, (4) obligations to the Company’s creditors are not accelerated, (5) the Company’s operating expenses remain at current levels and/or the Company is successful in restructuring and/or deferring ongoing obligations, (6) the Company is able to continue its research and development activities, particularly in regards to remaining compliant with the FDA and ongoing safety and efficacy of its products, and/or (7) the Company obtains additional working capital to meet its contractual commitments and maintain the current level of Company operations through debt or equity sources.
There is no assurance as to when the adverse impact to the United States and worldwide economies resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak will be eliminated, if at all, and whether any new or recurring pandemic outbreaks will occur again in the future causing similar or worse devastating impact to the United States and worldwide economies and our business. In addition, there is no assurance that the products we currently produce will not be subject to the FDA’s previously announced intended enforcement policies regarding HCT/P’s and/or the Company will be able to complete its revenue growth strategy. There is no assurance that the Company’s research and development activities will be successful or that the Company will be able to timely fund the required costs of those activities. Without sufficient cash reserves, the Company’s ability to pursue growth objectives will be adversely impacted. Furthermore, despite significant effort since July 2015, the Company has thus far been unsuccessful in achieving a stabilized source of revenues. As described above, the COVID-19 crisis has significantly impaired the Company and the overall Unites States and World economies.
If revenues do not increase and stabilize, if the COVID-19 crisis is not satisfactorily managed and/or resolved, if the Company’s ability to process, sell and/or distribute the products currently being produced or developed in the future are restricted, and/or if additional funds cannot otherwise be raised, the Company might be required to seek other alternatives which could include the sale of assets, closure of operations and/or protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws. As of October 31, 2021, based on the factors described above, the Company concluded that there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern for the 12 months following the issuance of these financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off-balance sheet financing arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a) (4) (ii) of Regulation S-K) and as of October 31, 2021 and through the date of this report, we had no such arrangements.
Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards
There were no recently issued financial accounting standards that would have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our audited consolidated financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require us to make significant estimates and judgments. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.
