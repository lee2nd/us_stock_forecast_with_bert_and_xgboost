A Non-GAAP Disclosure
Executive Summary
2021 was an incredibly successful year for Republic Bank and the “Power of Red is Back” expansion campaign. We grew assets, loans, and deposits resulting in dramatic improvement in profitability during the year. Earnings improved by nearly 400% year over year as a result of our ongoing effort to drive revenue growth at a greater rate than expense growth.
Financial Highlights
●
Net income increased by 398% to $25.2 million, or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.1 million, or $0.07 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020.
●
Earnings before tax increased to $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of $27.3 million, or 426%, year over year.
●
The improvement in earnings was driven by strong growth in revenue while our focus on cost control initiatives continues to limit expense growth. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, total revenue increased 26% and non-interest expense increased by 4% compared to the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020.
●
Total deposits increased by $1.2 billion, or 29%, to $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. New stores opened since the beginning of the “Power of Red is Back” expansion campaign are currently growing deposits at an average rate of $41 million per year, while the average deposit growth for all stores over the last twelve months was approximately $37 million per store.
●
We achieved this significant growth in deposits while driving down the overall cost of funds. The cost of funds decreased to 0.40% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.64% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
●
Total assets increased by $561 million, or 11%, to $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, which were $636.6 million and $119.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, total assets increased by $1.1 billion, or 24%, year over year.
●
Excluding PPP loans, total loans grew $371 million, or 18%, to $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020.
●
Asset quality remains strong as the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.24% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020. There were no customers deferring loan payments at the end of the year. All customers that were granted deferrals during the height of the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments.
●
The net interest margin increased by 18 basis points to 2.69% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.51% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by a decline in the cost of funds during 2021.
●
We had 32 convenient store locations open at year end. We opened a new store in Ocean City in January 2022 and Wayne in April 2022. Construction is ongoing at an additional site in Broomall, Pennsylvania, which is expected to opening in late 2022.
●
Our residential mortgage division, Oak Mortgage, is serving the home financing needs of customers throughout our footprint. The Oak Mortgage team originated more than $579 million in mortgage loans during 2021.
●
Book value per common share increased to $4.68 as of December 31, 2021 compared to $4.41 as of December 31, 2020.
PPP Loan Program
The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) included in the CARES Act authorized financial institutions to make loans to companies impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We responded by quickly developing a process to accept applications for the program not only from our valued small business customers, but from non-customers throughout our community as well.
●
During 2020, we originated more than $680 million in the first round of the PPP loan program for more than 5,000 businesses. Republic was one of the top PPP lenders in the country as of March 31, 2020, as the percentage of PPP loans originated compared to our existing loan portfolio balances reached 36%.
●
We originated more than 2,500 PPP loans totaling $272 million during the second round of the PPP loan program.
●
More than 50% of the PPP loan applications received were from businesses that were not existing customers of Republic Bank, many of which have switched their primary banking relationship with Republic.
●
Net origination fees received by Republic for both rounds of the PPP loan program totaled $32 million. As of December 31, 2021 $4 million in fees remain deferred and will be recognized as income in future periods.
●
We continue to assist our PPP loan customers with the application process for loan forgiveness with fewer than 800 loan forgiveness applications remaining to be processed.
Non-GAAP Based Financial Measures
Our selected financial data contains a non-GAAP financial measure calculated using non-GAAP amounts. This measure is tangible book value per common share. Tangible book value per share adjusts the numerator by the amount of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (as a reduction of Shareholders’ Equity). Management uses non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. Management believes the use of non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing our financial results and use of equity. Disclosures of this type should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.
The following table provides a reconciliation of tangible book value per common share as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
In reviewing and understanding our financial information, you are encouraged to read the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes as being critical.
Allowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments would represent management’s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and would be recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, if necessary. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to operations. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance.
The allowance for credit losses is an amount that represents management’s estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Because the allowance for credit losses is dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond Republic’s control, the estimate of the allowance for credit losses could differ materially in the near term.
The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are categorized as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. All identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.
In estimating the allowance for credit losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers’ perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. These qualitative risk factors include:
1)
Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices.
2)
National, regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments.
3)
Size and composition of the portfolio and terms of loans.
4)
Experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff.
5)
Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications.
6)
Quality of the Company’s loan review system, and the degree of oversight by the Company’s Board of Directors.
7)
Existence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.
8)
Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.
Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management’s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, and the borrower’s prior payment record. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
An allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company’s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan’s collateral.
For commercial, consumer, and residential loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.
For commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower’s financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable agings or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets.
As a result of the changes in economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased the qualitative factors for certain components of the allowance for loan loss calculation. We have also taken into consideration the probable impact that the various stimulus initiatives provided through the CARES Act, along with other government programs, may have to assist borrowers during this period of economic stress. We believe the combination of ongoing communication with our customers, relatively low loan-to-value ratios on underlying collateral, loan payment deferrals, increased focus on risk management practices, and access to government programs such as the PPP should help mitigate potential future period losses. We will continue to closely monitor all key economic indicators and our internal asset quality metrics as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold.
Loans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants such borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a temporary reduction in interest rate or an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date. Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for six consecutive months after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 30, 2020 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency are not classified as TDRs if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law which amended certain sections of the CARES Act. This amendment extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of (i) January 1, 2022 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, there were no loan customers deferring loan payments, and all customers that were granted deferrals to assist during the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments. At December 31, 2020, twenty-one customers with outstanding balance of $16 million, were deferring loan payments. At December 31, 2020, deferrals were comprised of the following categories: 90 day deferrals amounted to eight customers with outstanding balances of $3 million and second deferrals amounted to thirteen customers with outstanding balances of $13 million.
The general component of the allowance calculation includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrower’s overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for commercial loans or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments, for commercial and consumer loans. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. Loans classified special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss are rated pass.
In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was adequate.
The Company adopted CECL effective January 1, 2022. Our implementation process included, among other things, assessment and documentation of governance and reporting processes and related internal controls; model development, documentation and validation; and the incorporation of qualitative adjustments for model limitations. ASU 2016-13 lists several credit loss methods that are acceptable such as a discounted cash flow method, loss-rate method and probability of default/loss given default (“PD/LGD”). We contracted with a third-party vendor to assist us in the application of ASU 2016-13 and utilize various methodologies such as Vintage, Cohort, and Weighted Average Remaining Maturity to estimate the allowance for credit losses. CECL and the resulting impact are discussed in more detail throughout the document.
Income Taxes - Management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, management’s estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision.
In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, management considers available positive and negative evidence, including the past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.
Results of Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
We reported net income of $25.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $5.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Earnings in 2021 were positively impacted by the Company’s focus on driving revenue growth and limiting expense growth through cost control initiatives.
Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased $37.4 million to $129.2 million as compared to $91.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Growth in net interest income was a result of an increase in interest income of $32.9 million and a reduction in interest expense of $4.5 million. The increase in interest income of $32.9 million, or 29%, was driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily investment securities and loans receivable. Interest expense decreased $4.5 million, or 20%, primarily due to a decrease in the rate on average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin increased by 18 basis points to 2.69% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.51% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
We recorded a loan loss provision of $5.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision of $4.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was largely associated with assumptions and estimates related to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, the nature of and concentration in certain credit types within the loan portfolio and loan growth for the period.
Non-interest income decreased $3.5 million to $32.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $36.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage banking income and gains on the sale of investment securities partially offset by an increase in service fees on deposit accounts and gains on the sale of SBA loans during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
Non-interest expenses increased $5.1 million to $122.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $117.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, and equipment expenses associated with our expansion strategy, offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $5.0 million in 2020.
Return on average assets and average equity were 0.50% and 7.92%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.13% and 1.86%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Average Balances and Net Interest Income
Historically, our earnings have depended primarily upon Republic’s net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis, setting forth for the periods average assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity, interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and Republic’s net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). Averages are computed based on daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average loans receivable. Yields are adjusted for tax equivalency, a non-GAAP measure, using a rate of 21% in 2021, 21% in 2020, and 21% in 2019.
Average Balances and Net Interest Income
(1) Yields on investments are calculated based on amortized cost.
(2) Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a Non-GAAP measure. Net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by $532, $585, and $539 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, to adjust for tax equivalency. The tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income
Net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $14.1 million, or 18%, over twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10.1 million, compared to $105.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income was the result of an increase in average interest-earning balances, primarily loans receivable during 2020, offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. Loan growth was driven by continued success with our expansion strategy driving new customer relationships, in addition to our participation in the PPP loan program. Origination fees paid by the SBA on PPP loans are also recognized as interest income over the life of the loans. We recognized approximately $6.8 million of origination fees related to PPP loans during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. Growth in loan balances and corresponding interest income helped offset the decline in interest income driven by a lower rate environment, including interest income associated with the investment securities portfolio. A decline in mortgage interest rates resulted in a sharp increase in prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities held in our portfolio which caused acceleration in the amortization of premiums related to those investments.
Total interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 decreased $4.5 million, or 20%, to $18.6 million from $23.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $4.4 million, or 19%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 due to lower interest rates, which was partially offset by an increase in deposit balances during 2021. Interest expense on other borrowings decreased by $114,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 due to a 10 basis point decrease in the average rate on other borrowings and an $8.1 million decrease in the average balance.
Changes in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 2.52% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus 2.26% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.69% and 2.51%, respectively. The improvement in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in interest income and a decline in the cost of funds.
Provision for Loan Losses
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a $4.2 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was largely associated with assumptions and estimates related to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, the nature of and concentration in certain credit types within the loan portfolio and loan growth for the period.
Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets declined to 0.24% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020. This is the seventh consecutive year that this ratio has declined. Net (recoveries) charge-offs as a percentage of average loans also declined during 2021.
Non-Interest Income
Total non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $3.5 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Mortgage banking income totaled $12.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5.6 million, compared to $17.6 million for the twelve months ended 2020. A decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated, which was primarily due to higher market interest rates, which led to a decline in refinancing activity, which drove the decrease in mortgage banking income. We recognized gains of $2,000 on the sale or call of securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.8 million, compared to gains of $2.8 million on the sales or calls of securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, service fees on deposit accounts totaled $14.0 million, which represents an increase of $2.9 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by growth in customer deposit accounts and transaction volume as we continue with our growth and expansion strategy. Gains on the sale of SBA loans totaled $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.5 million, compared to $1.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Loan and servicing fees totaled $3.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which represents an increase of $39,000 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Non-Interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. An explanation of changes of non-interest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.
Salary expenses and employee benefits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased by $3.0 million, or 5%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. There were 32 stores open as of December 31, 2021 compared to 31 stores open at December 31, 2020.
Occupancy expense, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $1.3 million, or 6%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, also as a result of our continuing growth and expansion strategy.
Other real estate owned expenses totaled $844,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $385,000, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was a result of higher costs to carry foreclosed assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
No goodwill impairment was booked during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Goodwill impairment totaled $5.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to the purchase of Oak Mortgage Company in 2016. During the third quarter of 2020 a goodwill impairment analysis was completed, which concluded that a write-off was required. All goodwill on the balance sheet was written off as a result of this one-time, non-cash charge.
All other non-interest expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased $5.4 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Increases in expenses related to data processing, professional fees, regulatory assessments and costs, other taxes, and legal were mainly associated with our growth strategy.
One key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of non-interest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net non-interest expenses equal non-interest expenses less non-interest income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the ratio was 2.41% compared to 2.97% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease in this ratio was mainly due to the increase in average assets and the goodwill impairment charge recognized in 2020, which did not recur in 2021.
Another productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of non-interest expenses to net interest income plus non-interest income. The efficiency ratio was 76% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 92% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to net interest income and non-interest income increasing at a faster rate than non-interest expenses.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $8.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rates for both the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 25% and 22%.
The Company evaluates the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
The Company is in a four-year cumulative profit position factoring in pre-tax GAAP income and permanent book/tax differences. Growth in interest-earning assets has occurred over the last several years and is expected to continue. The Company has added fourteen store locations in the past five years and since the inception of the growth and expansion strategy in 2014, almost every new store location has met or exceeded growth expectations. The success of the expansion strategy, combined with the stabilization of interest rates and continued loan growth, are expected to continue to support improvement in profitability. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has no federal NOLs to carry forward, which would have potentially been at risk of expiring in the future.
Conversely, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the local and global economy may result in a significant increase in future loan loss provisions and charge-offs. Rising interest rates and a downturn in the economy could significantly decrease the volume of mortgage loan originations and have a negative impact on asset quality.
Based on the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), the Company believed that the positive evidence considered at December 31, 2021 outweighed the negative evidence and that it was more likely than not that all of the Company’s deferred tax assets would be realized within their life cycle. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not required at December 31, 2021.
The net deferred tax asset balance was $12.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability.
Preferred Dividends
Preferred dividends of $3.5 million and $923,000 were declared and paid on preferred stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Net Income and Net Income per Common Share
The net income available to shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $21.7 million, compared to net income of $4.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, basic net income per common share was $0.37 and $0.07, respectively, and diluted net income per common share was $0.33 and $0.07, respectively.
Return on Average Assets and Average Equity
Return on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was 0.50% compared to 0.13%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by average stockholders’ equity. The ROE for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was 7.92%, compared to 1.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Results of Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
We reported net income of $5.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Earnings in 2020 were positively impacted by our participation in the PPP program and the Company’s focus on cost control initiatives and revenue growth.
Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased $14.0 million to $91.8 million as compared to $77.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Growth in net interest income of $14.0 million was a result of an increase in interest income of $10.1 million and a reduction in interest expense of $3.9 million. The increase in interest income of $10.1 million, or 10%, was driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily loans receivable, offset by a decrease in the rate of average interest-earning assets. Interest expense decreased $3.9 million, or 15%, primarily due to a decrease in the rate on average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin decreased by 34 basis points to 2.51% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.85% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
We recorded a loan loss provision of $4.2 million, an increase of $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a provision of $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was largely associated with assumptions and estimates related to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-interest income increased $12.5 million to $36.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $23.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in mortgage banking income, higher loan and servicing fees, an increase in service fees on deposit accounts, and gains on sale of investment securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Non-interest expenses increased $12.9 million to $117.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $104.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a one-time charge for goodwill impairment and higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, and equipment expenses associated with the addition of new stores related to our expansion strategy.
Return on average assets and average equity were 0.13% and 1.86%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to (0.12%) and (3.41%), respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $14.1 million, or 18%, over twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10.1 million, compared to $105.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income was the result of an increase in average interest-earning balances, primarily loans receivable during 2020, offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. Loan growth was driven by continued success with our expansion strategy driving new customer relationships, in addition to our participation in the PPP loan program. Origination fees paid by the SBA on PPP loans are also recognized as interest income over the life of the loans. We recognized approximately $6.8 million of origination fees related to PPP loans during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. Growth in loan balances and corresponding interest income helped offset the decline in interest income driven by a lower rate environment, including interest income associated with the investment securities portfolio. A decline in mortgage interest rates resulted in a sharp increase in prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities held in our portfolio which caused acceleration in the amortization of premiums related to those investments.
Total interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased $3.9 million, or 15%, to $23.1 million from $27.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $3.5 million, or 13%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 due to lower rates offset by increases in average deposit balances. Lower interest rates were caused by actions taken by the Federal Reserve Bank during the first quarter of 2020 in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest expense on other borrowings decreased by $423,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in the average rate on other borrowings.
Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 2.26% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus 2.54% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.51% and 2.85%, respectively. Compression in the net interest margin was primarily driven by a 70 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets resulting from the lower interest rate environment and fixed rate 1.00% loans generated through PPP lending.
Provision for Loan Losses
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $4.2 million, an increase of $2.3 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a $1.9 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative factors in the calculation of the provision for loan losses were adjusted to account for this uncertainty. While the U.S. government has taken swift action to provide stimulus and implement programs to support the economy, the long-term impact of the effect on the economy remains uncertain.
Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets declined to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 0.42% as of December 31, 2019. This is the sixth consecutive year that this ratio has declined. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans also declined during 2020.
Non-Interest Income
Total non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $12.5 million, or 53%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Mortgage banking income totaled $17.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.5 million, compared to $10.1 million for the twelve months ended 2019. An increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans due to a decline in interest rates drove the increase in mortgage banking income. Loan and servicing fees totaled $2.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which represents an increase of $1.4 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, service fees on deposit accounts totaled $11.1 million, which represents an increase of $3.5 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by growth in customer deposit accounts and transaction volume as we continue with our growth and expansion strategy. We recognized gains of $2.8 million on the sale of securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.7 million, compared to gains of $1.1 million on the sales of securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Gains on the sale of SBA loans totaled $1.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.4 million, versus $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Lower origination volumes related to SBA loans was caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-Interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses increased by $12.9 million, or 12%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. An explanation of changes of non-interest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.
Salary expenses and employee benefits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased by $2.4 million, or 4%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. There were 31 stores open as of December 31, 2020 compared to 29 stores open at December 31, 2019. The increase was also a result of higher commissions paid to residential mortgage lenders as a result of growth in the volume of mortgage loan originations.
Occupancy expense, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $4.2 million, or 23%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, also as a result of our continuing growth and expansion strategy. The full year impact of the two new stores opened in New York City during 2019 was recognized in 2020.
Other real estate owned expenses totaled $459,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.7 million, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was a result of lower costs to carry foreclosed assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Goodwill impairment totaled $5.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020 a goodwill impairment analysis was completed, which concluded that a write-off was required. All goodwill on the balance sheet, which was related to the acquisition of Oak Mortgage Company in 2016, was written off as a result of this one-time, non-cash charge for goodwill impairment.
All other non-interest expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased $3.0 million compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Increases in expenses related to data processing, debit card processing, professional fees, and regulatory assessments and costs were mainly associated with our growth strategy.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the ratio was 2.97% compared to 2.71% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in this ratio was mainly due to our growth and expansion strategy.
The efficiency ratio was 91.69% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 102.90% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was due to net interest income and non-interest income increasing at a faster rate than non-interest expenses.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to a benefit of $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rates for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 22% and (28%), respectively. The effect of permanent deductions increases the effective tax benefit percentage when in a pre-tax loss position and decreases the effective tax rate when in a pre-tax income position. The impact of these permanent differences on the effective tax rate is proportional to the level of the non-taxable income in relation to pre-tax income.
The Company evaluates the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
The Company is in a three-year cumulative profit position factoring in pre-tax GAAP income and permanent book/tax differences. Growth in interest-earning assets is expected to continue, supported by the capital raise completed during 2020. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets along with other credit quality metrics continue to improve. A number of cost control measures have been implemented to offset the challenges faced in growing revenue as a result of compression in the net interest margin. The Company has added thirteen store locations in the past four years and since the inception of the growth and expansion strategy in 2014, almost every new store location has met or exceeded expectations. The success of the expansion strategy, combined with the stabilization of interest rates and continued loan growth, are expected to continue to support improvement in profitability going forward. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no federal NOLs to carry forward which could expire in the future.
Conversely, the Company’s net interest margin declined during 2020 as a result of the challenging interest rate environment. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the local and global economy may result in a significant increase in future loan loss provisions and charge-offs. Rising interest rates and a downturn in the economy could significantly decrease the volume of mortgage loan originations.
Based on the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), the Company believed that the positive evidence considered at December 31, 2020 outweighed the negative evidence and that it was more likely than not that all of the Company’s deferred tax assets would be realized within their life cycle. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not required at December 31, 2020.
The net deferred tax asset balance was $12.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability.
Preferred Dividends
Preferred dividends of $923,000 were declared and paid on preferred stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Net Income and Net Income per Common Share
The net income available to shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $4.1 million, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, basic and fully diluted net income per common share was $0.07, compared to basic and fully diluted net loss per common share of $0.06 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Return on Average Assets and Average Equity
The ROA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.13% and (0.12%), respectively. Return on average equity The ROE for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 1.86%, compared to (1.41%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Financial Condition
December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020
Total assets increased by $560.9 million, or 11%, to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition to our ongoing success with our expansion strategy, the growth in assets was also driven by our participation in the PPP loan program, which resulted in a significant increase in new business relationships and account openings in 2021. A more detailed discussion of changes in the balance sheet accounts can be found in the following paragraphs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits comprise this category, which consists of our most liquid assets. The aggregate amount in these three categories decreased by $656.4 million to $118.9 million at December 31, 2021, from $775.3 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease as of December 31, 2021 was caused by repayment of short-term borrowings in the amount of $633.9 million related to the PPP loan program in 2020.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and residential mortgage loans, both of which we intend to sell in the future. Total SBA loans held for sale were $5.2 million and $3.0 million at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $8.5 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $41.8 million, compared to $50.4 million at December 31, 2020. A decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans during 2021 drove the decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2021. Loans held for sale, as a percentage of our total assets, were less than 1% at December 31, 2021.
Restricted Stock
Restricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, is carried at cost as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (“ACBB”).
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the investment in FHLB stock totaled $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The $471,000 increase was due to a higher required investment in FHLB stock during 2021. At both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ACBB stock totaled $143,000.
Premises and Equipment
The balance of premises and equipment increased to $127.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $123.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to premises and equipment expenditures of $12.7 million reduced by depreciation and amortization expense of $8.4 million during 2021. The expenditures made during 2021 primarily relate to the construction of new store locations in addition to normal investments in hardware, software and other operating equipment. A new store was opened in Deptford, New Jersey bringing the total store count to thirty-two at December 31, 2021.
Other Real Estate Owned
The balance of other real estate owned decreased to $360,000 at December 31, 2021 from $1.2 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of valuation adjustments and dispositions totaling $1.2 million offset by additions of $360,000 during 2021.
Operating Leases - Right of Use Asset
Under ASC 842, the right-of-use asset is valued as the initial amount of the lease liability obligation adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid or accrued rent, and any lease incentives. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the operating lease right-of-use asset was $75.6 million and $72.9 million, respectively.
Goodwill
In connection with the review of our financial condition in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles for potential impairment on an interim basis at the end of each quarter during 2020. Goodwill was written off as a result of an interim test completed as of September 30, 2020. This was a complete write-off of all goodwill on the balance sheet. There was no goodwill on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Investment Securities Portfolio
Republic’s investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk. We attempt to maximize earnings while minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk. Investment securities available for sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions, and for liquidity and other purposes. Our debt securities consist primarily of U.S. Government agency SBA bonds, U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”), agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), municipal securities, and corporate bonds. Investment securities available for sale totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to $529 million at December 31, 2020. The $547 million increase was primarily due to the purchase of securities totaling $706 million partially offset by the paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities totaling $142 million during 2021. At December 31, 2021, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $12 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $1 million at December 31, 2020. The $12.9 million decrease in the unrealized gain/(loss) of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates, which drove a decrease in value of the securities held in our portfolio during 2021.
Investment securities held-to-maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. These investments are carried at amortized cost. The held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (“SBIC”) and SBA bonds, CMOs and MBSs. The fair value of securities held-to-maturity totaled $1.6 billion and $837.0 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The $810.4 million increase was primarily due to the purchase of securities held to maturity totaling $1.1 billion partially offset by the paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities held in the portfolio totaling $269.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.
ASC 320 “Investments - Debt Securities” requires an entity to determine how to classify a security at the time of acquisition. The appropriateness of the original classification should be reassessed at each reporting period. The transfer of investment securities from available-for-sale to held-to maturity category during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was completed after an extensive analysis of the characteristics of all securities held in the portfolio, in addition to a review of our liquidity position under multiple scenarios including varying interest rate environments. Twenty-three of the twenty-five securities transferred from available-to-sale to held-to-maturity were collateralized mortgage obligations. Thirteen securities transferred were GNMA collateralized mortgage obligations which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The remaining ten collateralized mortgage obligations were issued by FNMA or FHLMC. Bonds issued by GNMA receive favorable risk rating when calculating regulatory risk-based capital ratios. In addition, GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC securities are often pledged as collateral as required to hold certain government deposits and are accepted as collateral as a result of the high quality and low-risk nature of these bonds. The other two securities transferred from available-for sale to held-to-maturity were FNMA agency mortgage-backed securities.
After completion of these analyses and consideration of the factors mentioned above, management determined that it had the intent and ability to hold specific securities until maturity and it was appropriate to transfer them to the held-to-maturity category during the fourth quarter of 2018.
The fair value of the securities transferred to the held-to-maturity category was $230.1 million. The book value of the securities on the date of transfer was $239.5 million. The unrealized holding gain or loss on each individual security calculated at the time of transfer was reported as a component of shareholders’ equity in the accumulated other comprehensive income account and will be amortized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of each security.
Equity securities consist of investments in the preferred stock of domestic banks. Equity securities are held at fair value. The fair value of equity securities at December 31, 2021 totaled $9.2 million compared to $9.0 million at December 31, 2020.
A summary of investment securities available for sale at fair value, investment securities held-to-maturity, and equity securities at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:
The total amortized cost of the investment securities portfolio has grown to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Investment securities represented 49% of total assets at December 31, 2021 and 27% of total assets at December 31, 2020. We evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of the interest rate environment and changing market conditions and when appropriate, take necessary actions to improve and enhance our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well structured and of high quality. At December 31, 2021, 95% of the portfolio consisted of U.S. government debt securities or U.S. government agency issued mortgage-backed securities which were rated Aaa /AA+ by the major credit rating agencies.
The investment securities portfolio includes investment securities classified as both available for sale and held to maturity and equity securities at fair value.
The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates rise and increases when interest rates fall. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and increases when credit spreads tighten. Net unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio were $24.5 million at December 31, 2021 compared to net unrealized gains of $23.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was a result of an increase in market interest rates in 2021. The available for sale portfolio had unrealized losses of $11.6 million at December 31, 2021 and unrealized gains of $1.3 million at December 31, 2020. The held to maturity portfolio had unrealized losses of $12.9 million at December 31, 2021 and unrealized gains of $22.0 million at December 31, 2020.
We held four U.S. Government agency securities, 27 collateralized mortgage obligations and sixty-one agency mortgage-backed securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021. Principal and interest payments of the underlying collateral for each of these securities carry minimal credit risk. Management found no evidence of other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on any of these securities and believes the unrealized losses are due to fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates and are considered temporary as of December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio included eight municipal securities with a total market value of $6.9 million. These securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment. Each bond carries an investment grade rating by either Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s. In addition, we periodically conduct our own independent review on each issuer to ensure the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in New Jersey where six municipal securities had a market value of $6.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, management found no evidence of OTTI on any of the municipal securities held in the investment securities portfolio.
At December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio included fifteen corporate bonds that were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were also driven by changes in market interest rates and not a result of credit deterioration. Seven of the fifteen corporate bonds are issued by four of the largest U.S. financial institutions. Each financial institution is well capitalized.
There were no proceeds from the sale of securities during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. A gain of $2,000 was realized on the call of securities. The tax provision applicable to the gain of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $1,000.
Proceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale in 2020 were $125.2 million. Gross gains of $3.0 million and gross losses of $230,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net gains of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $700,000.
Proceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale in 2019 were $54.7 million. Gross gains of $1.2 million and gross losses of $67,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net gains of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $280,000.
The following table presents the maturity distribution and weighted average yield by holding type and year of maturity of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2021. Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date. Equity securities are at fair value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.
We follow the guidance issued under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).
An asset’s or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities, which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments, are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used. Management’s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments.
The types of instruments valued based on matrix pricing in active markets include all of our U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds, and municipal obligations. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820-10, we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.
Level 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. There was one Level 3 investment security classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2021. This security is a corporate bond.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
The Level 3 investment security classified as available for sale is a corporate bond that is not actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuer’s financial statements. The issuer is a “well capitalized” financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.
Loan Portfolio
Loans Receivable
The loan portfolio represents our largest asset category and is our most significant source of interest income. Our lending strategy is focused on small- and medium-sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services. The loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate, construction loans, residential mortgages, home improvement loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, overdraft lines of credit, PPP loans and others. Commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium-sized businesses and professionals for working capital, asset acquisition and other purposes. Commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5 million, but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to our legal lending limit to a customer, which was approximately $51.2 million at December 31, 2021. Loans made to one individual customer, even if secured by different collateral, are aggregated for purposes of the lending limit. There were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at December 31, 2021. A $34 million threshold, which amounts to approximately 10% of total regulatory capital, reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline. We had one loan relationship in excess of $34 million at December 31, 2021. The internal monitoring guideline in place as of December 31, 2020 was $30 million. We had no loan relationships in excess of that guideline at December 31, 2020.
The majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace, Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, Southern New Jersey, and New York City. Repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries in which our customers operate. We evaluate each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral varies but primarily includes residential, commercial and income-producing properties.
At December 31, 2021, we had loan concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of $509.2 million, which represented 20% of gross loans receivable. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2021, we had no foreign loans outstanding.
Loans decreased $143.9 million, or 5%, to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2021, versus $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Loans originated through the PPP loan program continue to be repaid or forgiven by the SBA, which offsets the growth experienced in other categories in the portfolio. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans, which decreased by $517.6 million in 2021, gross loans increased by $374 million, or 18%, to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020. We continue to see results from the continued success with our relationship banking model which has driven a steady flow in quality loan demand. We experienced strongest growth in the commercial and industrial, construction and land development, owner-occupied real estate, commercial real estate and residential mortgage categories during 2021.
The following table sets forth gross loans by major categories for the periods indicated:
Total loans, net of deferred loan costs, decreased $138 million, or 5%, to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2021, versus $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to a $517.6 million reduction in PPP loans. Excluding the impact of the PPP loan program, loans grew $374 million, or 18%, year over year.
Loan Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity
The amount of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated, which are due in: (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, is shown in the following table. Loan balances are also categorized according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
In the ordinary course of business, loans maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole or in part, as to principal amount, and at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal. At December 31, 2021, 85% of total loans were fixed rate compared to 89% at December 31, 2020.
Loss Mitigation and Loan Portfolio Analysis
We took a proactive approach to analyze and prepare for the potential challenges to be faced as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our customers. A detailed analysis of loan concentrations and segments that present the areas of highest risk was prepared and was closely monitored. Our commercial lending team initiated contact with a majority of our loan customers to discuss the impact that the pandemic crisis had on their businesses and the expected ramifications that could be felt in the future. We executed loan modifications and initiated payment deferrals for all customers that had an immediate need for assistance.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 30, 2020 or (ii) 60 days after the President declared a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency were not classified as TDRs if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law which amended certain sections of the CARES Act. This amendment extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of i) January 1, 2022 or ii) 60 days after the President declares a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, there were no loan customers deferring loan payments, and all customers that were granted deferrals to assist during the height of the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments. At December 31, 2020, 21 customers with outstanding balances of $16 million, were deferring loan payments. At December 31, 2020, deferrals were comprised of the following categories: 90 day deferrals amounted to eight customers with outstanding balances of $3 million and second deferrals amounted to thirteen customers with outstanding balances of $13 million.
As a result of the changes in economic conditions driven by the COVID pandemic, we increased the qualitative factors for certain components of our allowance for loan loss calculation. We also took into consideration the probable impact that the various stimulus initiatives provided through the CARES Act, along with other government programs, could have to assist borrowers during this period of economic stress. We believe the combination of ongoing communication with our customers, relatively loan-to-value ratios on underlying collateral, loan payment deferrals, increased focus on risk management practices, and access to government programs such as the PPP, successfully mitigated potential losses. While economic conditions have improved, we will continue to closely monitor key economic indicators and our internal asset quality metrics as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic may still impact our customer base if new variants of the virus arise. The provision for loan losses and charge-offs may be impacted in future periods.
Credit Quality
Republic’s written lending policies require specific underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with independent credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. A committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained, while approving the majority of commercial loans.
Loans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment of principal and/or interest in full is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms.
While a loan is classified as non-accrual, any collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. For non-accrual loans, which have been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.
The following summary shows information concerning loan delinquency and non-performing assets at the dates indicated:
Problem loans can consist of loans that are performing, but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms. At December 31, 2021, all identified problem loans included in the preceding table are internally classified and have been evaluated for a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses (see discussion on “Allowance for Loan Losses”).
Non-performing assets decreased by $822 thousand, or 6%, to $13.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $14.0 million at December 31, 2020. Non-performing loans of $12.9 million at December 31,2021 were equivalent to non-performing loans at December 31, 2020. The reduction in other real estate owned was the result of the disposition of four OREO properties for a total of $1.2 million offset by the addition of two properties for a total of $360,000.
The following summary shows the impact on interest income of non-accrual loans, subsequent to being placed on non-accrual for the periods indicated:
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish an allowance against loan losses on a quarterly basis. When an increase in this allowance is necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. The allowance for loan losses consists of three components. The first component is allocated to individually evaluated loans found to be impaired and is calculated in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. The second component is allocated to all other loans that are not individually identified as impaired pursuant to ASC 310-10 (“non-impaired loans”). This component is calculated for all non-impaired loans on a collective basis in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. The third component is an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management’s estimation process.
We evaluate loans for impairment and potential charge-off on a quarterly basis. Management regularly monitors the condition of borrowers and assesses both internal and external factors in determining whether any loan relationships have deteriorated. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have an individual collateral evaluation analysis prepared to determine if a deficiency exists. We first evaluate the primary repayment source. If the primary repayment source is determined to be insufficient and unlikely to repay the debt, we then look to the secondary repayment sources. Secondary sources are conservatively reviewed for liquidation values. Updated appraisals and financial data are obtained to substantiate current values. If the reviewed sources are deemed to be inadequate to cover the outstanding principal and any costs associated with the resolution of a troubled loan, an estimate of the deficient amount will be calculated and a specific allocation of loan loss reserve is recorded.
Factors considered in the calculation of the allowance for non-impaired loans include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, experience and ability of management, and general economic conditions along with other external factors. Historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge-offs over a three-year period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for loan loss table below.
The entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio. Our principal focus, therefore, is on the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is subject to review by banking regulators on a regular basis. Our primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
A detailed analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the years indicated is as follows:
(1) Includes non-accruing loans.
The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. We recorded a loan loss provision of $5.8 million in 2021 compared to a $4.2 million provision in 2020. The increase was primarily caused by the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative factors in the calculation of the provision for loan losses were adjusted to account for this uncertainty.
The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.24% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.28% as of December 31, 2020. Net (recoveries) charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding declined to (0.01%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 147% at December 31, 2021 as compared to 101% at December 31, 2020 and 75% at December 31, 2019. All loans individually evaluated for impairment are adequately secured with collateral and/or specific reserves. Coverage is considered adequate by management as of December 31, 2021.
Management makes at least a quarterly determination as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the status of all non-accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team. The Board of Directors also considers specific loans, pools of similar loans, historical charge-off activity, economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses.
We evaluate loans for impairment and potential charge-offs on a quarterly basis. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with the guidance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on impaired loans to determine if a deficiency exists. Our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged-off immediately upon reaching the 90-day delinquency mark unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. The timing on charge-offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment, either from the cash flow of the borrower, collateral sources, and/or guarantors, will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely. A full or partial charge-off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation.
Serious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge-off. Reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge-offs. The likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrower’s financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge-off.
Partial charge-offs of non-performing and impaired loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non-performing loan balance in the impaired loan category. The amount of non-performing loans for which partial charge-offs have been recorded during the year amounted to $403,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2020. Our charge-off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, there have been no changes made to this policy.
We have an existing loan review program, which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. A loan review officer who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the Board of Directors.
Estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult, particularly in a continually changing economy. In management’s opinion, the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021. However, there can be no assurance that, if asset quality deteriorates in future periods, additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required.
The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories. The allocation is based on management’s evaluation of historical charge-off experience and adjusted for several qualitative factors. The entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category.
The allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows:
We provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance, when the collateral is the only source of repayment. Also, we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans identified as “internally classified accruing loans” based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates. Those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management’s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition. An unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above. Management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments. These factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions, industry and geographic loan concentrations, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates. The impact of the above is considered in light of management’s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors.
The majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes, while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans. We attempt to evaluate larger loans individually, on the basis of our loan review process, which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information. Our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups. For PPP loans, the SBA guarantees 100% of the principal and interest owed by the borrower.
A loan is considered impaired, in accordance with ASC 310, when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming loans, but also include internally classified accruing loans. As of December 31, 2021, management identified no troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio. One troubled debt restructuring in the amount of $4.5 million was identified as of December 31, 2020.
The following table presents our impaired loans at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $15.1 million, $19.6 million, and $18.1 million, respectively. Republic earned $113,000, $478,000, and $386,000 of interest income on impaired loans (internally classified accruing loans) in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. There were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein.
Total impaired loans increased by $451,000, or 3%, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance related to impaired loans increased to $2.7 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $591,000 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, internally classified accruing loans totaled approximately $6.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
The following table presents our 30 to 89 days past due loans at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
Management has engaged in active discussions with all delinquent relationships to address delinquencies and is confident that acceptable resolutions will be achieved in the near term. Total loans 30 to 89 days past due increased to $9.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 due primarily to the addition of one loan in the fourth quarter of 2021 totaling $4.1 million. PPP loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $2.1 million at December 31, 2021.
Deposits
Deposits, which include non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, savings and time deposits, are Republic’s major source of funding. Deposits are generally solicited from our market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on multi-product relationships.
Total deposits increased by $1.2 billion to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2021, from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2020. This increase can be attributed to our strategy to expand the reach of our banking model which focuses on enhancing the total customer experience including in-store, on-line and mobile banking options. High levels of customer service and convenience across all delivery channels drives the gathering of low-cost, core deposits. We recognized strong growth in demand deposit balances, including an increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits of 39%, year over year as a result of the successful execution of our strategy. The increase in demand deposits over the last twelve months is also a result of our participation in the PPP loan program. Many of the PPP loans originated were for small businesses that were previously not customers of Republic Bank. Many of these small businesses have chosen to move their primary banking relationship to Republic as a result of the outstanding level of service and cooperation they experienced during the PPP loan process. Commercial deposits were 44% of total deposits as of December 31, 2021.
Total deposits by account type at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:
The average balances and weighted average rates of Republic’s interest-bearing deposits for the last three years are as follows:
Time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, by maturity, as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:
Other Borrowings
As part of the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia offered secured discounted borrowings to banks that originated PPP loans through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF program. The Company did not pledge any PPP loans or borrow any funds as part of the PPPLF program at December 31, 2021 since the PPPLF program was discontinued on July 30, 2021. At December 31, 2020, we borrowed $633.9 million through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility provided by the Federal Reserve Bank at a rate of 35 basis points. This borrowing was repaid in full during the first week of January 2021.
Operating Lease Liability Obligation
Under ASC 842, the operating lease liability obligation is calculated as the present value of the lease payments, using the discount rate specified in the lease, or if that is not available, our incremental borrowing rate. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the operating lease liability obligation was $81.8 million and $77.6 million, respectively.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity increased $16.1 million to $324.2 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $308.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings of $21.7 million partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.8 million associated with a decrease in the market value of the investment securities portfolio. The shift in market value of the securities portfolio was primarily driven by a increase in market interest rates, which decreased the market value of the securities held in our portfolio.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements.
Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately $549.8 million and $428.9 million and standby letters of credit of approximately $18.0 million and $16.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. Of the $549.8 million of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2021, substantially all were variable rate commitments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
The following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2021:
As of December 31, 2021, we had entered into non-cancelable lease agreements for our main office and operations center, twenty current and pending retail branch facilities, five loan offices, one storage facility, and seventeen equipment leases expiring on various dates through August 31, 2059. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. The minimum rental payments required under these leases are $115.9 million through the year 2059.
We have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers. At December 31, 2021, the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately $1.1 million, with a minimum age of 65 established to qualify for the payments.
Interest Rate Risk Management
We attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments. Management uses an “interest sensitivity gap” (“GAP”) analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities. A GAP analysis is the difference between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. Adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income.
Management presently believes that the effect of any future reduction in interest rates, reflected in lower yielding assets, could be detrimental since we may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, other borrowings and certain transaction accounts. An increase in interest rates could have a negative effect due to a possible lag in the re-pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static GAP analysis. Interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched. We attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period-to-period fluctuations therein. We typically define interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities as those that re-price within one year or less. Generally, we limit long-term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.
A positive GAP occurs when interest-sensitive assets exceed interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing in the same time periods, and a negative GAP occurs when interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets re-pricing in the same time periods. A negative GAP ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates, and a positive GAP ratio suggests the converse. Static GAP analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time. However, it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. Interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re-pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities. For purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis, assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity, estimated likely call date, or earliest re-pricing opportunity. Mortgage-backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. Savings, money market and interest-bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re-pricing term and can be withdrawn or re-priced at any time. Management estimates the re-pricing characteristics of these accounts based upon decay rates and run off projections obtained in a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management’s estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental. As a result of the run off projections, these deposits are not considered to re-price simultaneously and, accordingly, a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year. However, management may choose not to re-price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates, for competitive or other reasons.
Shortcomings, inherent in a simplified and static GAP analysis, may result in an institution with a negative GAP having interest rate behavior associated with an asset-sensitive balance sheet. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Furthermore, re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating GAP in the manner presented in the table below.
The following tables present a summary of our GAP analysis at December 31, 2021. Amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re-price, including prime-based loans. For purposes of these tables, we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because, statistically, certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date, even without regard to interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage-backed securities.

Demand, savings and money market accounts are scheduled to reprice based upon decay rate and run off percentage estimates obtained through a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management’s estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily subjective and could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based.
In addition to the GAP analysis, we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity. Income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income, but also other factors such as yield curve relationships, the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions.
Net Portfolio Value and Net Interest Income Analysis
The income simulation models management used to measure interest rate risk and manage interest rate sensitivity generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value (NPV) and net interest income (NII) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2021 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated (dollars in thousands):
In addition to modeling changes in NPV, we also analyze potential changes to NII for a forecasted twelve-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios. The following tables shows the NII model as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:
(1) The net interest income results were calculated assuming a rate ramp, achieving the rate change over a 12-month period, not an immediate and sustained rate shock.
As is the case with the GAP table, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV and NII require the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.
Management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable. However, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based. Periodically, we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions, which are subjective. Prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities have increased over historical levels in recent years due to the lower interest rate environment, and may result in reductions in margins.
Capital Resources
We have two outstanding issues of trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital.
In December 2006, Republic Capital Trust II (“Trust II”) issued $6.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to the Company. Trust II purchased $6.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company due 2037, and the Company used the proceeds to call the securities of Republic Capital Trust I (“Trust I”). The debentures supporting Trust II have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.73% over the 3-month LIBOR rate. The Company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years without a prepayment penalty.
On June 28, 2007, Republic Capital Trust III (“Trust III”) issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million common securities to the Company. Trust III purchased $5.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company due 2037, which have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.55% over the 3-month LIBOR rate. The Company has the ability to call the securities on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.
Deferred issuance costs included in subordinated debt were $63,000 and $70,000 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Amortization of deferred issuance costs was $7,000, $6,000, and $6,000 in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2021 was $324.2 million compared to $308.1 million as of December 31, 2020. The book value per share of our common stock increased to $4.68 as of December 31, 2021, based upon 58,943,153 shares outstanding, from $4.41 as of December 31, 2020, based upon 58,859,778 shares outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
We are required to comply with certain “risk-based” capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The risk-based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank. The guidelines also assign weights to the “credit-equivalent” amounts of certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts.
Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative risk. Under applicable capital rules, Republic is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 6%, a minimum total capital requirement of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%. Under the rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.
The risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank’s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for “prompt corrective action” or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a bank’s capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level or earnings; concentrations of credit, quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and management’s overall ability to monitor and control risks.
Management believes that the Company and Republic met, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis. In the current year, the FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed Republic’s category.
The Company and Republic’s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans, the impact of future economic events on Republic’s loan customers and Republic’s ability to manage its interest rate risk, growth and other operating expenses.
The following table presents the Company’s and Republic’s capital regulatory ratios calculated based on Basel III guidelines at December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Liquidity
A financial institution must maintain and manage liquidity to ensure it has the ability to meet its financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity; the repayment of borrowings as they mature; the payment of lease obligations as they become due; the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments; and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Our most liquid assets consist of cash, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold and securities available for sale.
Regulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors. In response to these requirements, we have formed an asset/liability committee (ALCO), comprised of certain members of Republic’s Board of Directors and senior management to monitor our liquidity position and interest sensitivity. That committee’s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring Republic’s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs. The ALCO committee meets quarterly or more frequently if deemed necessary.
Our target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest-earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities. Our most liquid assets, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, totaled $118.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $775.3 million at December 31, 2020. Loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity. At December 31, 2021, Republic estimated that more than $115 million of loans would mature or repay in the six-month period ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, a significant portion of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments (including unused lines of credit and letters of credit) of $567.8 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled $166.0 million at December 31, 2021. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments.
Daily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates, buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Pittsburgh. We maintain a line of credit with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding overnight borrowings. At December 31, 2021, FHLB had issued a letter on Republic’s behalf, totaling $100.0 million against our available credit. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding overnight borrowings. At December 31, 2020, FHLB had issued a letter on Republic’s behalf, totaling $150.0 million against our available credit. We also maintain a contingency line of credit of $10.0 million with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (“ACBB”) and a Fed Funds line of credit with Zions Bank in the amount of $15.0 million to assist in managing our liquidity position. We had no amounts outstanding against the ACBB line of credit or the Zions Fed Funds line at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As part of the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia offered secured discounted borrowing capacity to banks that originated PPP loans through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF program. The Company did not pledge any PPP loans or borrow any funds as part of the PPPLF program at December 31, 2021 since the PPPLF program was discontinued on July 30, 2021. At December 31, 2020, the Company pledged $633.9 million of PPP loans to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to borrow $633.9 million of funds at a rate of 0.35%.
Variable Interest Entities
We follow the guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, with regard to variable interest entities. ASC 810 clarifies the application of consolidation principles for certain legal entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest. An entity is subject to consolidation under ASC 810 if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entity’s activities, or are not exposed to the entity’s losses or entitled to its residual returns (“variable interest entities”). Variable interest entities within the scope of ASC 810 will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both.
We do not consolidate our subsidiary trusts. ASC 810 precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred securities when determining if we have the right to a majority of the trusts’ expected residual returns. The non-consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of $341,000. In addition, the income received on our investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income.
Effects of Inflation
The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.
