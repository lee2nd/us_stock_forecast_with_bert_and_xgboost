ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which are presented elsewhere in this annual report.
The Company was incorporated on August 8, 2016 for the purpose of becoming the bank holding company of the Bank in a share exchange transaction that was intended to constitute a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the IRC. This reorganization was consummated on November 1, 2016, at which time the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and all of the Bank’s stockholders became stockholders of the Company by virtue of the conversion of their shares of common stock of the Bank into an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the industry in which the Company operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in the annual report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses as the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses.
Management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, we must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of income. Examples include investment securities, goodwill and core deposit intangible, among others.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted all companies, governmental agencies, and individuals across the Country since the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and it continues to do so.
The U.S. and state governments reacted to the outbreak of the pandemic by issuing shelter-at-home orders and requiring that non-essential businesses be closed to prevent spread of the virus. The health crisis quickly turned into a financial crisis resulting in guidance and mandates regarding foreclosures and repossessions and accounting and regulatory changes designed to encourage banks to work with customers suffering detrimental financial impact.
Although states, including Maryland, have eased many of the previously-imposed COVID-19 restrictions, including stay-at-home orders and the required closure of non-essential businesses, and many individuals have been vaccinated, there are still a significant number of active infections throughout the Country, including in the State of Maryland, and individuals continue to become infected. As a result, it is possible that states, including Maryland, will re-implement some or all of the COVID-19 related restrictions that have been lifted and again require some or all non-essential businesses to close or drastically alter their business operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our customers and, thus, our financial condition and results of operations.
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
The U.S. Government’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) established the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which provided small businesses with resources to maintain payroll, hire back employees who may have been laid off, and to cover applicable overhead expenses. During 2020, we made over $32 million in PPP loans and acquired $6 million as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. in 2020 (see the discussion below under “Financial Condition”). During 2021, we made an additional $22 million of PPP loans. All PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, have up to a five-year maturity, and have an interest rate of 1%. These loans may be forgiven by the SBA if the borrower meets certain conditions, including by using at least 75% of the loan proceeds for payroll costs. All of the PPP loans made in 2020 have been forgiven as of December 31, 2021. $10 million of the PPP loans made in 2021 remained outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The SBA also established processing fees from 1% to 5%, depending on the loan amount. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company collected approximately $1,037,000 in fees from the SBA in connection with the origination of PPP loans compared to approximately $1,286,000 collected in 2020. The fees, net of related origination costs, are being recognized as interest income over the term of the loans using the straight-line method, with accelerated recognition when the loan pays off before maturity through SBA forgiveness or other means. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $909,000 as interest income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Effective on October 1, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Carroll Community Bank (collectively, “Carroll”) in a series of merger transactions (the “Merger”) pursuant to which the stockholders of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. received cash in the aggregate amount of $24.8 million in exchange for their shares of common stock of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. The merger consideration was paid by the Company using $7.8 million in cash and $17 million in proceeds from a third-party term loan obtained in connection with the Merger. At the Effective Time of the Merger, Carroll had total assets of $176,159,890, net loans of $145,153,100, and total liabilities of $157,992,286, of which $144,896,990 represented deposits. The Merger was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values at the effective time of the Merger.
Total assets were $716,677,255 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $39,360,173, or 5.8%, over the $677,317,082 recorded at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $93,534,086 in securities available for sale and held for maturity, offset by a decrease of $39,679,180 in loans and a decrease of $14,513,564 in cash and cash equivalents.
Total liabilities were $660,055,797 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $34,468,198, or 5.5%, over the $625,587,599 recorded at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $53,013,123 in deposits, offset by a decrease of $19,339,946 in securities sold under repurchase agreements. The increase in deposits was comprised of a $21,020,502 increase in noninterest-bearing accounts and a $31,992,621 increase in interest-bearing accounts.
Stockholders’ equity was $56,621,458 at December 31, 2021 compared to $51,729,483 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,891,975, or 9.5%. The increase was due primarily to net income for 2021 of $8,149,606, offset by an after-tax unrealized loss on available for sale securities of $2,101,213 and dividends paid, net of reinvestments, of $1,156,418.
Loans
Major categories of loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
The Company had no foreign loans for any of the years presented.
Loans decreased by $39,679,180, or 7.6%, to $482,011,334 at December 31, 2021 from $521,690,514 at December 31, 2020. The decline was due primarily to decreases in commercial loans of $30,185,899, residential real estate loans of $13,891,728, and construction/land development loans of $5,420,062, offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans of $9,900,305. The commercial loan decrease was primarily due to a decrease in PPP loans of $22.4 million. In addition, home equity and lines of credit usage decreased $8.1 during 2021 as a result of government economic stimulus that pumped trillions of dollars into the economy. The allowance for loan losses increased $353,730 to $3,650,268 at December 31, 2021 as compared to $3,296,538 at December 31, 2020.
- 25 -
Commercial loans in the table above include $9.7 million and $32.1 million of PPP loans as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. $22 million were originated during 2021 compared to $38 million originated in 2020. A substantial portion of the PPP loans in the Company’s portfolio are expected to be forgiven by the SBA. During 2021, the Company collected approximately $1,037,000 in fees from the SBA in connection with the originations of the PPP loans compared to approximately $1,286,000 collected in 2020. The fees, net of related origination costs, are being recognized as interest income over the term of the loans using the straight-line method, with accelerated recognition when the loan pays off before maturity through SBA forgiveness or other means. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $909,000 as interest income from PPP loans.
The Company has adopted policies and procedures that seek to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio. These policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. These policies, coupled with continuous training efforts, have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process. Lending authority is based on the level of risk, size of the loan, and the experience of the lending officer. The Company’s policy is to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves. Management believes that this tends to reduce risk because management is familiar with the credit histories of loan applicants and has in-depth knowledge of the risk to which a given credit is subject. Although the loan portfolio is diversified, its performance will be influenced by the economy of the region.
The maturities and interest rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 is a follows:
An age analysis of past due loans, segregated by class of loans, as of year-end, is as follows:
- 26 -
It is the Company’s policy to place a loan in nonaccrual status when any portion of the principal or interest is 90 days past due unless there are mitigating factors. Management closely monitors nonaccrual loans. The Company returns a nonaccrual loan to accruing status when (i) the loan is brought current with the full payment of all principal and interest arrearages, (ii) all contractual payments are thereafter made on a timely basis for at least six months, and (iii) management determines, based on a credit review, that it is reasonable to expect that future payments will be made as and when required by the contract.
Year-end non-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, were as follows:
At December 31, 2021, the Company had two nonaccrual commercial real estate loan totaling $4,810,965, one nonaccrual residential real estate loan totaling $31,500, and one commercial loan totaling $152,449. The real estate loans were secured by real estate and business assets and were personally guaranteed. The commercial loan was secured by business assets and was personally guaranteed. Gross interest income of $219,734 would have been recorded in 2021 if these nonaccrual loans had been current and performing in accordance with the original terms. The Company allocated $281,910 of its allowance for loan losses to these nonaccrual loans. The balance of the nonaccrual loans was net of charge-offs and a nonaccretable discount totaling $27,146 at December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had one nonaccrual commercial real estate loan totaling $4,407,829 and two nonaccrual residential real estate loans totaling $220,967. The loans were secured by real estate, business assets and a personal guaranty. Gross interest income of $13,395 would have been recorded in 2020 if these nonaccrual loans had been current and performing in accordance with the original terms. The Company allocated $0 of its allowance for loan losses to these nonaccrual loans. The balance of the nonaccrual loans was net of charge-offs and a nonaccretable discount totaling $8,176 at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had one residential real estate loan with a carrying value of $217,661 and two commercial loans with a carrying value of $263,241 that were delinquent 90 days or greater in addition to the nonaccrual loans listed above. The residential loan is a chronic delinquent loan that the borrower brings current at least several times a year. The two commercial loans were PPP loans that were fully insured and were paid in full in January 2022. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no loans that were delinquent 90 days or greater other than the nonaccrual loans listed above.

Year-end impaired loans are set forth in the following table:
Impaired loans include certain loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Company’s loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower’s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had one commercial real estate loan totaling $2,009,967 and one residential loan totaling $39,228 classified as TDRs. Both loans are included in impaired loans above. Each loan is paying as agreed. There have been no charge-offs or allowances associated with these two loans.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had two commercial real estate loans totaling $2,252,316 and one residential loan totaling $44,733 classified as TDRs. One of the commercial real estate loans with a principal balance of $182,656 was restructured as a TDR during 2020. All three loans are included in impaired loans above. Each loan is paying as agreed. There have been no charge-offs or allowances associated with these three loans.
Year-end TDRs are set forth in the following table:
Section 4013 of the U.S. Government’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act allows financial institutions to suspend application of certain current TDRs accounting guidance under ASC 310-40 for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency, provided certain criteria are met. This relief can be applied to loan modifications for borrowers that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and to loan modifications that defer or delay the payment of principal or interest, or change the interest rate on the loan. In April 2020, federal and state banking regulators issued the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus to provide further interpretation of when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, specifically indicating that if the modification is either short-term (e.g., six months) or mandated by a federal or state government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty under ASC 310-40. The Company continues to prudently work with borrowers negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic while managing credit risks and recognizing appropriate allowance for loan losses in its loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, one loan totalling $4.3 million, or 1% of the Company’s loan portfolio, was operating under a deferral. This loan was not classified as a TDR as of December 31, 2021 because it met the criteria discussed above.
- 28 -
As part of our portfolio risk management, the Company assigns a risk grade to each loan. The factors used to determine the grade are the payment history of the loan and the borrower, the value of the collateral and net worth of any guarantor, and cash flow projections of the borrower. Special mention, Substandard, and Doubtful grades are assigned to loans with a higher frequency of delinquent payments and/or the collateral and/or cash flow are insufficient to support the loan and such loans are included on the Company’s watch list. The Special mention grade is intended to be a temporary grade.
Year-end loans graded special mention, substandard and doubtful are set forth in the following table:
The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses and is charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses represents an amount which, in management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans and other extensions of credit that may become uncollectible. The Company's allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, "Receivables" and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, "Contingencies." Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit and internal risk grade, specific homogeneous risk pools and specific loss allocations, with adjustments for current events and conditions.
The Company's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, classified and criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.
Although management believes, based on currently available information, that the Company’s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time, no assurances can be given that the Company’s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the Company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions at the time management determined the current level of the allowance for loan losses.
- 29 -
The following tables detail activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.
- 30 -
The Company recorded net recoveries of $23,730 and $77,823 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The provision for loan losses was $330,000 in 2021 and $625,000 in 2020.
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned (“OREO”) at December 31, 2021 included two properties with an aggregate carrying value of $1,242,365. The first property is an apartment building in Baltimore, Maryland with a carrying value of $1,242,365 that was acquired in the Merger. The property is under an optional sales contract, but is expected to close in 2022. The other property is land in Cecil County, Maryland with a carrying value of $0. It was acquired through foreclosure in 2007. The latter property consists of 10.43 acres and is currently under contract for a gross sales price of $295,000 with closing expected in 2022. Due to the length of time that the latter property has been held, Maryland banking law required a write-down of the value to $0 in 2019.
Investment Securities
Investment securities increased $93,534,086, or 120.6%, to $171,089,891 at December 31, 2021 from $77,555,805 at December 31, 2020. The Company utilized its increased liquidity, which was generated as a result of growing deposits and a decreasing loans portfolio, by increasing its investment in mortgage-backed securities by $92.9 million. In addition, the Company also increased its investment in corporate bonds by $2.4 million. Most of this increase was invested in the subordinated debt of other community banks. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had classified 87% and 70%, respectively, of the investment portfolio as available for sale. The remaining balance of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity.
Securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the Company’s asset/liability management strategy. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of income taxes. Securities classified as held to maturity, which management has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. The Company does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near-term sales, and, therefore, does not own trading securities. The Company manages the investment portfolio within policies that seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity, manage interest rate sensitivity, meet earnings objectives, and provide required collateral for deposit and borrowing activities.

The following table sets forth the carrying value of investment securities at December 31:
The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of investment securities at December 31, 2021:
SBA pools and mortgage-backed securities are due in monthly installments.
Deposits
Total deposits were $626,414,670 at December 31, 2021 compared to $573,401,547 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $53,013,123, or 9.2%. The increase was due to a $19,069,054 increase in savings accounts, a $22,723,333 increase in interest bearing checking accounts, a $7,254,307 increase in money market accounts and a $21,020,502 increase in noninterest-bearing accounts, offset by a $17,054,073 decrease in certificates of deposit. The following table shows the average balances and average costs of deposits for the years ended December 31:

As of December 31, 2021, certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 mature as follows:
Uninsured deposits totaled $164,458,319 at December 31, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, lines of credit, including home-equity lines and commercial lines, and letters of credit. Loan commitments generally have interest rates at current market values, fixed expiration dates, and may require a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates and do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will draw upon their lines in full at any one time. Letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.
For commitments to extend credit, lines of credit, and letters of credit, the Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
At December 31, 2021, the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments were as follows:
Management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements are reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Borrowings and Other Contractual Obligations
The Company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of borrowings and operating leases for various facilities.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent overnight borrowings from customers. Securities owned by the Company which are used as collateral for these borrowings are primarily U.S. government agency securities.
On September 30, 2020, Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. borrowed $17,000,000 from First Horizon Bank (“FHN”) to be used, on October 1, 2020, to fund a portion of the merger consideration paid in the Merger. Net of issuance costs of $28,126, the proceeds of the net long-term debt was $16,971,874. The loan matures on September 30, 2025. The interest rate on the loan is fixed at 4.10%. The Company made quarterly interest-only payments through October 1, 2021. During the remaining term of the loan, the Company is required to make quarterly interest and principal payments of approximately $646,472, which is based on a nine-year straight-line amortization schedule. The remaining balance of approximately $9,916,667 will be due at maturity. To secure its obligations under this loan, the Company pledged all of its shares of common stock of the Bank to the lender.

Specific information about the Company’s borrowings and contractual obligations is set forth in the following table:
The terms of the Company’s operating leases, including the future minimum payments under those leases, are disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
The Company reported net income of $8,149,606 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,682,003 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $5,467,603 from 2020 was due to an increase in net interest income of $5,570,601, a decrease in noninterest expense of $1,453,809, a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $295,000, and an increase in noninterest income of $93,795, offset by an increase in income taxes of $1,945,602. The primary driver of the significant increase in net income was the Merger that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. Also, income from PPP loans added approximately $802,000 to net income. As of December 31, 2021, $196,000 of deferred PPP fees, net of income taxes, have not been recognized.
- 34 -
The Company incurred significant one-time costs during 2020 in connection with the Merger. The table below provides a comparison of the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus the prior year with and without $3,236,817 of acquisition costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Interest Income
The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded net interest income of $22,875,104 compared to $17,304,503 for 2020, an increase of $5,570,601. The increase was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $164,702,972 to $664,748,917 in 2021 from $500,045,945 in 2020, offset by a decline in the net yield on interest-earning assets of 3 basis points to 3.47% in 2021 from 3.50% in 2020.
Total interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $4,917,223 to $25,680,403, from $20,763,180 for 2020. The increase was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in average interest earning assets, offset by a decrease of 30 basis points in the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets to 3.89% in 2021 from 4.19% in 2020.
Interest income from loans was $23,491,614 in 2021 compared to $19,291,162 in 2020, an increase of $4,200,452. This increase was attributable to a $94,156,885 increase in the average balance of loans to $515,167,318 in 2021 from $421,010,433 in 2020, offset by a 2 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to 4.56% in 2021 from 4.58% in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded interest income on securities of $2,123,293. For the same period of 2020, interest income on securities was $1,395,493. The $727,800 increase in 2021 was attributable to a $54,322,031 increase in the average balance of securities to $119,905,876 in 2021 from $65,583,845 in 2020, offset by a 48 basis point decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on securities to 1.92% in 2021 from 2.40% in 2020.
Interest income on federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets (FHLB stock and certificates of deposit) decreased $11,029 to $65,496 in 2021 compared to $76,525 in 2020.

The following table sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table distinguishes between (i) changes in net interest income attributed to volume (change in volume multiplied by the prior year's interest rate), and (ii) changes in net interest income attributed to rate (change in rate multiplied by the prior year's volume). The change in interest due to the combined rate and volume changes is allocated proportionally to the change in volume and rate.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $2,165,914 in 2021 compared to $2,072,119 in 2020, an increase of $93,795. The increase was primarily due to a 148,656 increase in service charges on deposits and a $41,823 increase in bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, offset by a $114,424 decrease in mortgage banking revenue. Service charges increased because customer transaction activity increased as COVID-19 restrictions eased in 2021 versus 2020. BOLI income increased because of the BOLI that was added as a result of the Merger. Our mortgage banking division experienced its second highest revenue total in 2021, after the highest in 2020, as a result of historically low interest rates. However, activity slowed in the fourth quarter of 2021 as mortgage interest rates began to move higher.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense decreased by $1,453,809 to $14,128,599 in 2021 from $15,582,408 in 2020. The decrease was due primarily to $3,236,817 in one-time acquisition costs related to the Merger in 2020, offset by additional personnel, locations and customers added with the Merger. Salaries and benefits increased $1,137,635, other expenses increased $200,819, and occupancy, furniture and equipment costs increased $125,339. In addition, FDIC premiums increased by $104,409 primarily due to the increase in assets and deposits.

Other noninterest expenses include the following:
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $1,945,602 to $2,432,813 in 2021 from $487,211 in 2020. Higher income before taxes was the primary driver of the decrease.
The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 23.0% in 2021, from 15.4% in 2020. The increase was due to a lower percentage of tax-exempt revenue. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the Company’s taxes, including a reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the Federal statutory rate of 21%.

INTEREST RATE RISK
The Company’s principal market risk is exposure to the risk that the interest rates associated with our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets will fluctuate. This risk arises from the Company’s lending, investing and deposit-taking activities, and is affected by many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences. Interest rate fluctuation has a direct impact on the Company’s net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk when deposits and other short-term liabilities have different repricing intervals than do loans, investments and other interest-earning assets. When interest-earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest-bearing liabilities, a decline in interest rates may cause a decline in net interest income. Conversely, when interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice faster than interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates may cause a decline in net interest income.
The Company recognizes that there are many types of interest rate risk. Management believes that the three types that pose the greatest potential threat to current and long-term earnings are:
•
Repricing risk - the difference in the timing of the scheduled maturity and re-pricing dates of assets and liabilities within a certain time frame;
•
Option risk - interest rate related options embedded in the Company’s assets and liabilities which change the cash flow characteristics of the assets and liabilities; and
•
Yield curve / basis risk - changes in the relationship between different interest rates with the same maturity or interest rates across a maturity spectrum which create compression or expansion of our net interest margin.
The Company uses earnings at risk and economic value at risk measures to quantify our exposure to these types of interest rate risk. We believe that using simulations that measure all three types of risks in combination is a more efficient tool for measurement, and we therefore do not routinely process models to isolate each risk. Rather, we combine the three types of analyses, which we believe provides a better overall result than a simulation based on a single system and a more economical use of resources than targeted models. Following is a description of the analyses to be utilized:
Earnings at Risk
Earnings at Risk (“EAR”) measures exposure to net changes in net interest income (“NII”), and is considered the Company’s best source of managing short-term interest rate risk (one-year and two-year time frames). EAR is a dynamic analysis, which can capture all the different forms of interest rate risk under many different interest rate scenarios, and using various assumptions for growth, optionality, and yield curve structure.
Economic Value of Equity
Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) is management’s primary analytical tool for measuring long-term interest rate risk, and helps to measure if the long-term safety and soundness of the Company is being compromised for the sake of short-term results. However, the Company also recognizes the inherent difficulties of calculating a definitive value for many sections of the balance sheet as well as the weakness that EVE ignores future events (e.g., growth, etc.). These difficulties, coupled with the nature of our core business, allow the Company to adopt wide limits for this measure.
In order to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates, the Board of Directors has established policies and procedures that include acceptable parameters for the relationship between rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities as measured by earnings at risk and economic value at risk. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews rate sensitivity measures on a quarterly basis. Material deviations from policy parameters are reported to the Board of Directors and corrective action is initiated and monitored.
Measures of NII at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution’s short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.

Based upon the simulation analysis performed at December 31, 2021 and 2020, management estimated the following changes in NII, assuming the indicated rate changes:
LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise out of the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet depositor withdrawal requirements, to fund loans, and to fund our other debts and obligations as they come due in the normal course of business. We maintain our asset liquidity position internally through short-term investments, the maturity distribution of the investment portfolio, loan repayments, and income from earning assets. On the liability side of the balance sheet, liquidity is affected by the timing of maturing liabilities and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowings as needed. The Bank is approved to borrow 75% of eligible pledged single family residential loans and 50% of eligible pledged commercial loans as well as investment securities, or approximately $83.0 million under a secured line of credit with the FHLB. The Bank also has a facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the “Reserve Bank”) under which the Bank could borrow approximately $25.3 million. Finally, the Bank has $23,500,000 ($14,500,000 unsecured and $9,000,000 secured) overnight federal funds lines of credit available from commercial banks. FHLB advances of $5,000,000 were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no borrowings from the Reserve Bank or from the commercial banks’ lines of credit at December 31, 2021 and 2020. On September 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $17,000,000 from a commercial bank, which was used on October 1, 2020 to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to the former stockholders of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. in the Merger. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2021, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $16,979,905. Management believes that we have adequate liquidity sources to meet all anticipated liquidity needs over the next 12 months. Management knows of no trend or event which is likely to have a material impact on our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $7,252,460 to $11,704,730 in 2021 from $4,452,270 in 2020 due primarily to the $5,467,603 increase in net income. Cash used in investing activities increased 13,283,910 to $58,984,893 in 2021 from $45,700,983 in 2020 due primarily to an $88,914,971 increase in the net cash outflow from the debt securities portfolio and a $19,366,118 decrease in the net cash outflow from the Merger, offset by a $59,339,596 increase in the net cash inflow from the loan portfolio. Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $40,336,432 to $32,766,599 in 2021 from $73,103,031 in 2020 due primarily to a $33,135,800 increase in the net cash outflow from securities sold under repurchase agreements and a $16,971,874 decrease in the net cash inflow from long-term debt, offset by an $8,000,000 decrease in the net cash outflow from FHLB advances.
Information about the various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments, to which we are subject is set forth above under the captions “Off-Balance Sheet Transactions” and “Borrowings and Other Contractual Obligations”.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND ADEQUACY
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possible additional, discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). Quantitative measures established by the Basel III Capital Rules to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined).
On September 17, 2019, the FDIC finalized a rule that introduces an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations (i.e., the community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) framework), as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The CBLR framework is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework.
On April 6, 2020, in a joint statement, the FDIC, Federal Reserve and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), issued two interim final rules regarding temporary changes to the CBLR framework to implement provisions of the CARES Act. Under the interim final rules, the community bank leverage ratio was reduced to 8% beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and 9% thereafter. In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 8%, less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. The Company has not opted-in to the CBLR framework.
Additional information regarding the capital requirements that apply to us can be found in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report.

The following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, for the Bank under the Basel III Capital Rules. The minimum required capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, based on the phase-in provisions of the Basel III Capital Rules. Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules.
The Company intends to fund future growth primarily with cash, federal funds, maturities of investment securities and deposit growth. Management knows of no other trend or event that will have a material impact on capital.
