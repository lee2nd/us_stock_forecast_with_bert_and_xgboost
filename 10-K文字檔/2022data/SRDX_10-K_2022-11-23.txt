ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis provide information management believes is useful in understanding the operating results, cash flows and financial condition of Surmodics. The following discussion should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Any discussion and analysis regarding our future financial condition and results of operations are forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, as more fully identified in “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” Our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.
Overview
Surmodics, Inc. (referred to as “Surmodics,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and other like terms) is a leading provider of performance coating technologies for intravascular medical devices and chemical and biological components for in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) immunoassay tests and microarrays. Surmodics develops and commercializes highly differentiated vascular intervention medical devices that are designed to address unmet clinical needs and engineered to the most demanding requirements. This key growth strategy leverages the combination of the Company’s expertise in proprietary surface modification and drug-delivery coating technologies, along with its device design, development and manufacturing capabilities. The Company’s mission is to improve the detection and treatment of disease. Surmodics is headquartered in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.
Vascular Intervention Medical Device Platforms
Within our Medical Device segment, we develop and manufacture our own proprietary vascular intervention medical device products, which leverage our expertise in performance coating technologies, product design and engineering capabilities. We believe our strategy of developing our own medical device products has increased, and will continue to increase, our relevance in the medical device industry. This strategy is key to our future growth and profitability, providing us with the opportunity to capture more revenue and operating margin with vascular intervention device products than we would by licensing our device-enabling technologies.
Highlighted below are select medical device products within our development pipeline that are a focus for development and commercialization efforts. For both our thrombectomy and radial access platforms, we are pursuing commercialization via a direct sales strategy leveraging a small team of experienced sales professionals and clinical specialists. Beginning in fiscal 2022, we began to see modest, but meaningful and growing revenue associated with the adoption, utilization and sales of our Pounce™ and Sublime™ platform products.
Pounce Thrombectomy Platform
We have successfully developed, internally and through acquisitions, two U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA" or the “Agency”) 510(k)-cleared mechanical thrombectomy devices for the non-surgical removal of thrombi and emboli (clots) from the peripheral vasculature (legs). In addition to FDA clearance, our Pounce Venous Thrombectomy System has received the Conformité Européenne Mark (“CE Mark”) approval prerequisite for commercialization in the European Union (”E.U.”). We believe that the ease of use, intuitive design and efficient performance of our thrombectomy products make these devices viable first-line treatment options for interventionalists. These devices include:
•Pounce Arterial Thrombectomy System for removal of clots from arteries in the legs associated with peripheral arterial disease (“PAD”). Commercial sales began in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
•Pounce Venous Thrombectomy System for removal of clots from veins in the legs generally associated with venous thromboembolism (”VTE”). Limited market evaluations are planned for fiscal 2023 to obtain physician feedback across a variety of cases and clinical conditions.
Sublime Radial Access Platform
We have successfully developed and secured FDA 510(k) regulatory clearance for a suite of devices that enable vascular intervention via radial (wrist) access for which commercial sales began in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These devices include:
•Sublime guide sheath to provide the conduit for peripheral intervention with an access point at the wrist that enables treatment all the way to the pedal loop of the foot;
•Sublime .014 RX PTA dilatation catheter for treatment of lesions in arteries below the knee all the way to the patient’s foot and around the pedal loop; and
•Sublime .018 RX PTA dilatation catheter for treatment of lesions in arteries above and below the knee.
Drug-coated Balloon Platform
Surmodics’ drug-coated balloons (“DCBs”) are designed for vascular interventions to treat PAD, a condition that causes a narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the extremities.
•SurVeilTM DCB is a paclitaxel-coated DCB to treat PAD in the upper leg (superficial femoral artery). In fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Abbott Agreement”) with Abbott Vascular, Inc. (“Abbott”) that provides Abbott with exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the SurVeil DCB product. Our SurVeil DCB utilizes a proprietary paclitaxel drug-excipient formulation for a durable balloon coating and is manufactured using an innovative process to improve coating uniformity.
The SurVeil DCB has the necessary regulatory approval for commercialization in the E.U., and timing of commercialization in the E.U. is at the discretion of our exclusive distribution partner, Abbott. In fiscal 2021, the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical trial of our SurVeil DCB met both the primary safety and primary efficacy endpoints and was found to be non-inferior to the control device in those endpoints.
In June 2021, we submitted the fourth and final module of our application to the FDA for premarket approval (“PMA”) of our SurVeil DCB, including certain long-term vital status data required by the FDA. The Agency provided us with comments on our PMA application and requested certain additional testing data. In October 2022, we submitted a complete response, including additional testing data, to the Agency’s comments on the PMA. The FDA may request additional information, including testing data, related to our most recent submission in support of the PMA application. Receipt of PMA from the FDA, if granted, would be expected to fulfill the requirements for a $30 million milestone payment pursuant to the Abbott Agreement (if PMA received by December 31, 2022), $27 million (if PMA received after December 31, 2022, but before June 30, 2023), or $24 million (if PMA received on or after June 30, 2023).
•SundanceTM DCB is a sirolimus-coated DCB used for the treatment of below-the-knee PAD, including critical limb ischemia (“CLI”). Our SWING first-in-human, 35-patient, 36-month clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and performance of our Sundance DCB when used to treat occlusive disease of the infra-popliteal arteries. The initial study data have demonstrated an excellent safety profile, with no major amputations and low rates of major adverse events. There were no clinically driven target lesion revascularizations in study participants between six and 12 months post procedure. The study also shows promising signals of potential performance of the device, with target lesion patency maintained at 12 months in 80% of per protocol patients. We are in the process of identifying and evaluating potential partnership opportunities for the clinical development and future commercialization of the Sundance DCB.
For more information regarding our product development and commercialization strategy, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CARES Act Employee Retention Credit
In fiscal 2021, a benefit of $3.6 million was recorded to reduce operating costs and expenses as a result of our eligibility for the employee retention credit under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") enacted in March 2020. This $3.6 million benefit in fiscal 2021 reflects anticipated reimbursement of personnel expenses we incurred in fiscal 2021 and 2020 and provided a $0.5 million benefit to product costs, a $2.2 million benefit to research and development (“R&D”) expense, and a $0.9 million benefit to selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense.
Results of Operations
Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020
Revenue. Fiscal 2022 revenue was $100.0 million, a $5.2 million or 5% decrease from fiscal 2021 revenue. Fiscal 2021 revenue was $105.1 million, a $10.3 million or 11% increase from fiscal 2020 revenue. The following is a summary of revenue streams within each reportable segment.
Medical Device. Revenue in our Medical Device segment was $72.4 million in fiscal 2022, a 7% decrease from $78.3 million in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by lower license fees revenue, partly offset by broad-based product sales growth.
•Medical Device product revenue increased 28% to $27.9 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $21.8 million in fiscal 2021. Broad-based sales growth across our portfolio of device and performance coating reagent products drove the increase in revenue year-over-year. Contributing to the growth in device sales were contract-manufactured balloon catheters, Pounce thrombectomy and Sublime radial access products commercialized in fiscal 2022, and proprietary specialty catheters distributed by strategic partners.
•Medical Device performance coatings royalties revenue decreased 2% to $30.3 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $30.8 million in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, royalties revenue continued to benefit from solid growth from customers utilizing our Serene™ coating. This was more than offset by several macroeconomic factors, including pressure on procedure volumes from hospital capacity constraints and customer supply chain disruptions, as well as by customer devices maturing through their product life cycles.
•License fee revenue from the Abbott Agreement for our SurVeil DCB decreased to $5.7 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $16.0 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the prior-year receipt of a milestone payment. In fiscal 2021, a $15.0 million milestone payment was received, on which $1.4 million and $11.3 million in revenue was recognized in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Abbott Agreement license fee revenue is recognized as costs are incurred on a proportional basis to total expected costs for the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical trial. The percentage of costs incurred relative to total estimated costs for the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical trial of our SurVeil DCB was approximately 85%, 76% and 65% as of September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We estimate this percentage will be approximately 92% by the end of fiscal 2023, with the remaining 8% of costs incurred and revenue recognized over the subsequent final two years of the TRANSCEND trial follow-up and clinical reporting period.
Future license fee revenue related to the Abbott Agreement will depend primarily on whether and when we receive the final milestone payment associated with receipt of the PMA for the SurVeil DCB. Receipt of PMA from the FDA, if granted, would be expected to fulfill the requirements for a milestone payment of up to $30 million. The milestone payment is reduced to $27 million if PMA is received after December 31, 2022 but before June 30, 2023, and to $24 million if PMA is received on or after June 30, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Abbott Agreement. The potential revenue during fiscal 2023 associated with the $30 million, $27 million or $24 million milestone payment would be approximately $27 million, $25 million or $22 million, respectively.
•Medical Device R&D and other revenue decreased 13% to $8.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $9.4 million in fiscal 2021, driven by lower coating services volume from supply chain challenges related to customer-supplied components.
In fiscal 2021, revenue in our Medical Device segment was $78.3 million, a 10% increase from $71.4 million in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by increased royalties and license fees revenue.
•Medical Device product revenue of $21.8 million in fiscal 2021 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2020. Growth from sales of performance coating reagents and from sales of specialty catheter products first commercialized in fiscal 2020 was largely offset by a decline in sales of legacy, contract-manufactured balloon catheters.
•Medical Device performance coatings royalties revenue increased 8% to $30.8 million in fiscal 2021, compared to $28.6 million in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 royalties revenue benefited from broad-based, year-over-year growth, most notably from our latest generation Serene coating customers, which more than offset the approximately $1.2 million tail-end impact to fiscal 2021 from the expiration of our fourth-generation hydrophilic patents. Royalties revenue from our latest generation Serene coating grew 38% year-over-year in fiscal 2021 and comprised 26% of total fiscal 2021 royalties revenue, compared to 20% of total royalties revenue in fiscal 2020. With respect to COVID-19, fiscal 2020 provides a favorable comparison due to the relative decline in magnitude of impacts to royalties revenue from reduced procedure volumes in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
•License fee revenue from the Abbott Agreement for our SurVeil DCB increased to $16.0 million in fiscal 2021, compared to $12.0 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the receipt of milestone payments. In fiscal 2021, Abbott Agreement license fee revenue included $11.3 million in revenue recognized on a $15.0 million milestone payment received during the period. In fiscal 2020, Abbott Agreement license fee revenue included $7.0 million in revenue recognized on a $10.8 million milestone payment received during the period.
•Medical Device R&D and other revenue increased 3% to $9.4 million in fiscal 2021, compared to $9.2 million in fiscal 2020, driven by commercial development projects with several of our performance coating customers. This increase was partly offset by a decline in coating services revenue due to lifecycle attrition for certain customer products.
In Vitro Diagnostics. Revenue in our IVD segment was $27.6 million in fiscal 2022, a 3% increase from $26.9 million in fiscal 2021, driven primarily by broad-based product sales growth, partly offset by lower R&D and other revenue.
•IVD product revenue increased 8% or $2.0 million in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2021. Sales growth year-over-year was broad-based, with increased sales across our portfolio of protein stabilization, distributed antigen, colorimetric substrate, and microarray slide/surface products.
•IVD R&D and other revenue was $0.9 million in fiscal 2022, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to $2.2 million in fiscal 2021, driven by the completion of a customer development program.
In fiscal 2021, revenue in our IVD segment was $26.9 million, a 15% increase from $23.5 million in fiscal 2020, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our distributed antigen products and customer development projects.
•IVD product revenue increased 9% or $2.0 million in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we saw sustained growth of our distributed antigen products used in autoimmune diagnostic testing. Revenue growth in fiscal 2021 was also driven by steady growth in sales of our protein stabilization and colorimetric substrate products, partly offset by a decline in sales volume of our microarray slide/surface products. With respect to COVID-19, the fiscal 2020 period provides a favorable comparison as we observed modest COVID-related impacts to revenue in the second half of fiscal 2020.
•IVD R&D and other revenue was $2.2 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2020, driven by customer development projects utilizing our microarray slide/surface products. The IVD business cultivates new product revenue opportunities by partnering with customers on their testing and development of new or improved diagnostic test products that utilize our enabling technology.
Product sales, product costs, product gross profit, product gross margin, and operating costs and expenses were as follows:
(1)Product gross profit is defined as product sales less related product costs.
(2)Product gross margin is defined as product gross profit as a percentage of product sales.
Product gross margins. Product gross margins were 62.8%, 63.0% and 65.4% in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Fiscal 2022 gross margin of 62.8% was comparable to the prior year. The benefit to fiscal 2022 product gross margin from leverage on higher sales volume was offset by the adverse mix impact from recent product introductions, which have lower product gross margins due to low production volumes. Product gross margins may continue to be impacted by the shift in revenue mix towards sales of medical devices at relatively lower margins, particularly during the scale-up phase after initial commercialization.
•Fiscal 2021 product gross margin was unfavorably impacted by a product replacement matter for one of the contract-manufactured products in our Medical Device business, which resulted in $0.7 million in product cost charges and a modest year-over-year decline in revenue. Fiscal 2021 product gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by a shift in product mix within the IVD business due to sales growth from relatively lower margin products. These decreases in fiscal 2021 product gross margin were offset, in part, by the $0.5 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act.
Research and development expense. R&D expense was $50.6 million, $46.7 million and $50.2 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Fiscal 2022 R&D expense increased by $3.9 million year-over-year and was 51% of revenue, compared to 45% of revenue in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2021 R&D expense included a benefit of $2.2 million associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. The fourth quarter fiscal 2021 Vetex acquisition added $1.2 million in R&D expense in fiscal 2022, compared to the prior year. R&D expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily related to medical device product development, including support for commercialization of our Pounce and Sublime product platforms.
•Fiscal 2021 R&D expense decreased by $3.5 million year-over-year and was 45% of revenue, compared to 53% of revenue in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 R&D expense included a benefit of $2.2 million associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. Clinical trial spending and other costs related to our SurVeil DCB declined in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, with the progression of the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical trial from patient follow up in fiscal 2020 to preparation of the clinical report and submission of the final PMA modules in fiscal 2021.
Selling, general and administrative expense. SG&A expense was $46.9 million, $30.7 million and $28.4 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Fiscal 2022 SG&A expense increased by $16.3 million year-over-year and was 47% of revenue, compared to 29% of revenue in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, we established a medical device direct salesforce to support the fiscal 2022 commercialization of our Pounce and Sublime product platforms. We expect SG&A expense to increase between $12.0 million and $13.5 million in fiscal 2023, compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a full year of expense for fiscal 2022 headcount additions.
•Fiscal 2021 SG&A expense increased by $2.3 million year-over-year and was 29% of revenue, compared to 30% of revenue in fiscal 2020. The increase in SG&A expense in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by personnel and other investments to support product development and strategic initiatives. These increases were offset, in part, by a benefit of $0.9 million recorded to SG&A expense in fiscal 2021 associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act.
Acquired intangible asset amortization. We have previously acquired certain intangible assets through business combinations, which are amortized over periods ranging from six to 14 years. The year-over-year increase in expense from amortization of the Vetex developed technology acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $1.5 million and $0.5 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
Acquisition transaction, integration and other costs. In fiscal 2021, we incurred $1.0 million in legal, accounting and other due diligence costs specifically related to the acquisition of Vetex.
Contingent consideration expense. We have contingent consideration obligations related to business combinations. Expense (gain) recognized is related to changes in the probability and timing of achieving certain contractual milestones, as well as accretion expense for the passage of time. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, contingent consideration expense consisted of accretion for liabilities associated with the fiscal 2021 Vetex acquisition.
Other expense. Major classifications of other expense were as follows:
Interest expense increased in fiscal 2022 and 2021 relative to the respective prior year due to rising interest rates and utilization of our revolving credit facility. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of financing arrangements and expectations for fiscal 2023 interest expense.
Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) result primarily from the impact of U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate fluctuations on certain intercompany transactions and balances. Investment income, net declined in fiscal 2022 and 2021 relative to the respective prior year due to the decline in the balance of available-for-sale investments. In fiscal 2020, we recognized a $0.5 million impairment loss on our strategic investment in ViaCyte, Inc. to reduce the carrying value to zero.
Income tax (expense) benefit. We reported income tax expense of $(4.8) million in fiscal 2022, income tax expense of $(2.1) million in fiscal 2021, and income tax benefit of $2.6 million in fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate was (21)%, 33% and 177% in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Recurring items cause our effective tax rate to differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, including U.S. federal and Irish R&D credits, Irish and U.S. state tax rates, and excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. In addition, the following items had a significant impact on reported tax (expense) benefit:
•In fiscal 2022, we recorded a non-cash charge to income tax expense of $10.2 million that resulted from the establishment of a full valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022. A valuation allowance is required to be recognized against deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. The relevant guidance weighs available evidence such as historical cumulative taxable losses more heavily than future profitability. The valuation allowance has no impact on the availability of U.S. net deferred tax assets to offset future tax liabilities.
•In fiscal 2021 and 2020, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the CARES Act. Under the temporary provisions of CARES Act, net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and carrybacks may offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 taxable years may be carried back to each of the preceding five years to generate a refund. In fiscal 2020, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $1.7 million that resulted from our ability under the CARES Act to carry back NOLs incurred to periods when the statutory tax rate was 35% versus our current tax rate of 21%.
Segment Operating Results
Operating results for each of our reportable segments were as follows:
Medical Device. Our Medical Device business reported an operating loss of $(22.9) million in fiscal 2022, compared to operating income of $4.7 million in fiscal 2021, representing (32)% and 6% of Medical Device revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•Medical Device operating expenses, excluding product costs, increased $19.5 million year-over-year in fiscal 2022. SG&A expense in the Medical Device business increased $14.8 million year-over-year in fiscal 2022 as we established a medical device direct salesforce to support the fiscal 2022 commercialization of our Pounce and Sublime product platforms. The fiscal 2021 Vetex acquisition added $2.7 million in R&D expense and acquired intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2022. In addition, the prior fiscal 2021 period included a benefit of $2.4 million to operating expenses, excluding product costs, associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act.
•Royalties and license fee revenue decreased $10.8 million in fiscal 2022, compared to the prior year, and contributed to the fiscal 2022 operating loss. License fee revenue decreased $10.3 million in fiscal 2022, compared to the prior year, as a result of the $15.0 million milestone payment received in fiscal 2021. Royalties revenue decreased $0.5 million in fiscal 2022, compared to the prior year.
•Medical Device product gross profit increased $3.9 million year-over-year in fiscal 2022, and product gross margins were 59.2% and 58.0% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Fiscal 2021 provides a favorable comparison due to $0.7 million in product cost charges in fiscal 2021 related to a product replacement matter. The benefit to fiscal 2022 product gross margin from leverage on higher sales volume was offset by the adverse mix impact from recent product introductions, which have lower product gross margins due to low production volumes.
In fiscal 2021, our Medical Device business reported operating income of $4.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $(3.2) million in fiscal 2020, representing 6% and (5)% of Medical Device revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Royalties and license fee revenue increased $6.4 million in fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year, and contributed to the fiscal 2021 operating income. License fee revenue reflects the timing of Abbott milestone payments received and increased $4.3 million in fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year, as a result of the $15.0 million milestone payment received in fiscal 2021 and the $10.8 million milestone payment received in fiscal 2020. Royalties revenue increased $2.2 million in fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth and significant prior-year COVID-19 impacts.
•In fiscal 2021, Medical Device operating income includes a $2.6 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act.
•Medical Device product gross profit declined $0.6 million year-over-year in fiscal 2021, and product gross margins were 58.0% and 61.3% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Product gross margins were unfavorably impacted by both a product replacement matter for one of our contract-manufactured products in fiscal 2021, which resulted in $0.7 million in product cost charges, and by unfavorable overhead absorption due to lower volume from the COVID-related decline in performance coating reagent sales in the first half of fiscal 2021. These impacts were offset, in part, by a $0.2 million benefit in fiscal 2021 associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act.
•Medical Device operating expenses, excluding product costs, declined $(1.9) million year-over-year in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2021 Medical Device operating costs and expenses, excluding product costs, include a benefit of $2.4 million associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. SG&A expense in our Medical Device business increased $1.3 million year-over-year in fiscal 2021, which is net of a $0.6 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit, as we invested in sales and marketing personnel and infrastructure to execute our long-term growth strategy. The fiscal 2021 Vetex acquisition added $1.1 million in R&D expense and acquired intangible asset amortization. These increases were offset, in part, by a year-over-year decline in R&D expenditures associated with the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical trial.
In Vitro Diagnostics. Our IVD business reported operating income of $13.1 million in fiscal 2022, a decrease of 5% or $0.7 million compared to fiscal 2021. IVD operating income was 47% and 51% of revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, R&D and other revenue decreased $1.3 million year-over-year due to the completion of a customer development program. In fiscal 2021, IVD operating income included a $0.5 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. These decreases were partly offset by a $1.1 million year-over-year increase in IVD product gross profit in fiscal 2022. IVD product gross margins were 66.5% and 67.5% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The prior year product gross profit includes a $0.2 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. Fiscal 2022 gross margin was unfavorably impacted by a shift in revenue mix towards distributed antigen products with relatively lower gross margins, partly offset by the favorable impact of leverage on revenue growth.
In fiscal 2021, our IVD business reported operating income of $13.8 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 17% or $2.0 million compared to fiscal 2020. IVD operating income was 51% and 50% of revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. R&D and other revenue increased $1.4 million year-over-year in fiscal 2021 from customer development project opportunities. In fiscal 2021, IVD operating income included a $0.5 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. IVD product gross profit increased $0.9 million year-over-year in fiscal 2021, and product gross margins were 67.5% and 69.4% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2021 product gross margins were favorably impacted by leverage on revenue growth and a $0.2 million benefit associated with the employee retention credit under the CARES Act. This was more than offset by a shift in revenue mix towards distributed antigen products with relatively lower gross margins.
Corporate. The Corporate category includes expenses for administrative corporate functions, such as executive management, corporate accounting, legal, information technology, human resources and Board of Directors related fees and expenses, which we do not fully allocate to the Medical Device and IVD segments. Corporate also includes expenses, such as acquisition-related costs and litigation, which are not specific to a segment and thus not allocated to our reportable segments. The unallocated Corporate expense operating loss was $(12.2) million, $(11.8) million and $(9.8) million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The year-over-year increase in Corporate expense in fiscal 2022 of $0.5 million, or 4%, was primarily related to compensation and facilities expenses. In fiscal 2021, the year-over-year increase in Corporate expense of $2.0 million, or 20%, was primarily driven by $1.0 million in Vetex acquisition transaction, integration and other costs and increased compensation expenses, partly offset by a $0.5 million benefit associated with the fiscal 2021 employee retention credit.
Cash Flow Operating Results
The following is a summary of cash flow results:
Operating Activities. Cash (used in) provided by operating activities totaled $(17.2) million, $15.4 million and $14.0 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we reported net (loss) income of $(27.3) million, $4.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities (reduced) increased cash flows from operating activities by $(12.3) million, $(4.9) million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities affecting cash flows during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 included:
•Cash used in deferred revenue was $(5.7) million, $(1.0) million and $(1.2) million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This was driven by the timing of the receipt of SurVeil DCB upfront and milestone payments from Abbott which totaled $15.0 million and $10.8 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, offset by related license fee revenue recognition of $5.7 million, $16.0 million and $12.0 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Cash used in inventories was $(5.1) million, $(0.8) million and $(1.4) million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 cash used in inventories was primarily driven by the commercialization of Pounce and Sublime product platforms in our Medical Device business, as well as prudent management of safety stock to mitigate supply chain risks.
•Cash (used in) provided by prepaids and other was $(0.7) million, $(2.4) million and $0.4 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash used in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by software expenditures. In fiscal 2021, cash used was primarily driven by a $3.6 million receivable recorded at the end of the period associated with the employee retention credit under the provisions of the CARES Act. Cash provided in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to a decrease in reimbursable Irish R&D expenses.
•Cash (used in) provided by accounts receivable and contract assets was $(1.5) million, $(2.5) million and $3.5 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 cash used was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable related to product sales growth. Fiscal 2021 cash used was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable related to timing fluctuations and by an increase in royalties receivable from customers (contract asset) from year-over-year growth in performance coatings royalties revenue. In fiscal 2020, cash provided was driven by a decline in accounts receivable on lower sales at the end of the period and by a decline in royalties receivable subsequent to the expiration of our fourth-generation hydrophilic coatings patents and as a result of the impact of COVID-19.
Investing Activities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $6.2 million, $(25.2) million and $(9.1) million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•In fiscal 2021, we invested $39.6 million in the acquisition of Vetex, which represented the upfront cash payment of $39.9 million net of acquired cash.
•We invested $3.4 million, $5.3 million and $3.7 million in property and equipment in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Net purchases and maturities of available-for-sale investments were a source (use) of cash totaling $9.6 million, $20.6 million and $(5.4) million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Financing Activities. Cash (used in) provided by financing activities totaled $(0.4) million, $10.2 million and $(4.6) million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•In fiscal 2021, we funded the Vetex acquisition, in part, from $10 million in borrowings on the $25 million revolving credit facility we had in place during the period.
•In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid $1.1 million, $2.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, to purchase common stock to pay employee taxes resulting from the exercise of stock options and vesting of other stock awards.
•In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we generated $1.2 million, $3.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from the sale of common stock related to our stock-based compensation plans.
•In fiscal 2020, we paid contingent consideration of $3.2 million related to the acquisition of NorMedix, Inc., with $0.6 million and $2.6 million classified as cash used in operating and financing activities, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2022, working capital totaled $25.5 million, a decrease of $14.9 million from September 30, 2021. We define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments totaled $19.0 million as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of $21.9 million from $40.9 million as of September 30, 2021.
Subject to the terms of the Abbott Agreement, the Company is to receive a milestone payment under the Abbott Agreement if the SurVeil DCB receives PMA. The amount of the milestone payment is $30 million upon PMA of our SurVeil DCB (if PMA is received prior to December 31, 2022), $27 million (if PMA is received after December 31, 2022 but prior to June 30, 2023), or $24 million (if PMA is received on or after June 30, 2023), pursuant to the terms of the Abbott Agreement.
The Company proactively manages its access to capital to support liquidity and continued growth. On October 14, 2022, Surmodics entered into a new, five-year secured credit agreement with MidCap Funding IV Trust, as agent, and MidCap Financial Trust, as term loan servicer and the lenders from time to time party thereto (together “MidCap”), comprised of up to $100 million in term loans ($25 million of which is at the sole discretion of MidCap) and a $25 million revolving credit facility. The Company drew $25 million on the term loan and $5 million on the revolving credit facility at close. These proceeds were partially used to retire the Company’s existing $25 million revolving credit facility with Bridgewater Bank, of which $10 million was outstanding. Upon closing, the Company’s cash balance increased by $19.5 million. Additional draws on the term loan may be made in increments of at least $10 million, up to a total of $50 million through December 31, 2024. A second tranche of up to $25 million may be available through December 31, 2024 at MidCap’s sole discretion. Availability to draw on the five-year, $25 million revolving credit facility is based on a borrowing base consisting primarily of the Company’s inventory and receivable balances. The credit agreement calls for interest-only payments on the term loan over the first four years, which can be extended to five years if certain criteria are met. The revolving credit facility matures in five years. The Company has also entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with Wells Fargo, whereby the initial borrowing on term loan’s variable base rate was fixed at 10.205% per annum for the five-year loan term. The revolving credit facility has an annual interest rate equal to 3.00% plus the greater of Term SOFR (as defined in the credit agreement) or 1.50%. The Company expects total interest expense under the credit agreement to be approximately $3.4 million in fiscal 2023.
As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s shelf registration statement with the SEC allows the Company to offer potentially up to $200 million in debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and other securities or any such combination of such securities in amounts, at prices, and on terms announced if and when the securities are ever offered.
In fiscal 2023, we anticipate an increase in SG&A expenditures of between $12.0 million and $13.5 million, as well as an increase in capital expenditures. We expect that increasing SG&A expenditures in fiscal 2023 will exceed any associated increases in revenues, and therefore will reduce our cash flow from operations. We also anticipate R&D expenses will continue to be significant in fiscal 2023, primarily related to medical device product development, including continued investment in our Pounce and Sublime product platforms. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments, which totaled $19.0 million as of September 30, 2022, together with cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility and term loans, will provide liquidity sufficient to meet our cash needs and fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2023. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at historic levels.
Beyond fiscal 2023, our cash requirements will depend extensively on the timing of market introduction and extent of market acceptance of products in our medical device product portfolio, including our SurVeil DCB if PMA is received. Our long-term cash requirements also will be significantly impacted by the level of our investment in commercialization of our vascular intervention device products and whether we make future corporate transactions. We cannot accurately predict our long-term cash requirements at this time. We may seek additional sources of liquidity and capital resources, including through borrowing, debt or equity financing or corporate transactions to generate cashflow. There can be no assurance that such transactions will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
Below is a summary of short-term and long-term anticipated cash requirements under contractual obligations existing as of September 30, 2022.
(1)The Company leases facilities for research, office, manufacturing and warehousing.
(2)Asset acquisition obligations consist of the gross value of payments to be made in connection with a fiscal 2019 asset acquisition, excluding amounts that are contingent upon unmet regulatory or commercial milestones. Business combination obligations consist of the gross value of guaranteed milestone payments to be made in association with the fiscal 2021 Vetex acquisition, excluding amounts that are contingent upon unmet product development and regulatory milestones.
(3)Clinical Research Organization (“CRO”) obligations represent contractual periodic payments for services performed and milestone payments to third-party CROs for services related to our ongoing clinical trials. The timing of payments and recognition of expenses under these contracts is dependent on patient follow-up for our ongoing clinical trial and may be different from the amounts presented.
For additional information regarding the above obligations, see Notes 2, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As of September 30, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.
Share Purchase Activity
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25.3 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, tender offers or by any combination of such methods. The authorization has no fixed expiration date. However, our credit agreement with MidCap prohibits us from acquiring outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.
Customer Concentrations
Revenue from customers that equaled or exceeded 10% of total revenue was as follows:
Our licensed technologies provide royalties and license fee revenue. We have agreements with a diverse base of customers, and certain customers have multiple products using our technology. Abbott and Medtronic plc (“Medtronic”) are our largest customers. Abbott has several separately licensed products, including the SurVeil DCB license, which generate royalties and license fee revenue for Surmodics. Revenue from the SurVeil DCB license represented 6%, 15% and 13% of total revenue for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Apart from the SurVeil DCB license, Abbott has several separately licensed products which generate revenue for Surmodics, none of which represented more than 3% of total revenue for fiscal 2022. Medtronic has several separately licensed products that generate royalties revenue for Surmodics, none of which represented more than 5% of our total revenue for fiscal 2022.
Our licensing agreements with many of our customers, including most of our significant customers, cover many licensed products that each separately generates royalties revenue. This structure reduces the potential risk to our operations that may result from reduced sales (or the termination of a license) of a single product for any specific customer.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is based in part on the application of significant accounting policies, many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions; see Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. They require the application of management’s most challenging subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently likely to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following are critical areas in the application of our accounting estimates that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
We license technology to medical device manufacturers (third parties) and collect royalties based on the greater of the contractual percentage of a customer’s sales of products incorporating our licensed technologies or minimum contractual royalties. Sales-based royalties revenue is recognized as our license customers sell products containing our technologies, which is generally reported to us a quarter after those sales occur. This requires us to estimate the revenue earned on these arrangements and record it prior to our customers reporting the underlying sales to us. Sales-based royalties are estimated using the most-likely amount method based on historical sales information, adjusted for known changes, such as product launches and patent expirations. We also consider macroeconomic factors affecting the medical device market. These inputs require significant management judgement and are updated quarterly. Minimum royalty fees are recognized through the non-cancellable period, which is generally 90 days, but can be up to one year. Revenue related to contingent milestones is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone, provided collectability is assured. Customer advances are accounted for as a liability (deferred revenue) until all criteria for revenue recognition have been met.
Revenue associated with our license and development agreement with Abbott is recognized as the clinical and regulatory activities are performed and control is transferred which is measured based on actual costs incurred relative to the expected total cost of the underlying activities, which consist of the TRANSCEND clinical trial. A significant component of the cost of this trial is the cost of our outsourced clinical trial CRO consultants, which are estimated based on executed statements of work, project budgets, and patient enrollment and follow-up timing, among other things. Costs related to the clinical and regulatory activities are expensed in the period incurred. A significant change to the Company’s estimate of the costs to complete the TRANSCEND clinical trial could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. The total expected cost of the trial is a significant management estimate and is reviewed and assessed each reporting period. The current portion of deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet represents the amount of deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized over the next year, based on estimated costs to be incurred. The estimate of future revenue from the Abbott Agreement will continue to be monitored and adjusted based on estimates in effect each period-end. For further disclosures related to revenue recognition, see Notes 2, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Goodwill and Definite-lived Intangible Assets
Our estimates associated with the annual test of goodwill for impairment, as well as the as-needed assessment of the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets, are considered critical due to the amount of these assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required.
We record all assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions at fair value, including goodwill and other intangible assets. The initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value assigned to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill is evaluated annually, and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change indicating that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
Our reporting units are the Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostics reportable segments. Inherent in the determination of fair value of the reporting units are certain estimates and judgments, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, as well as management’s strategic plans with regard to its operations. When utilizing a quantitative assessment, we determine fair value at the reporting unit level based on a combination of an income approach and market approach. The income approach is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant, while the market approach is based on sales and/or earnings multiples of similar companies. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and the timing of those cash flows, discount rates reflecting risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparables.
We perform our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment as of July 1st of each fiscal year. Goodwill was not impaired in either reporting unit based on the outcome of the fiscal 2022 annual impairment test, which utilized a quantitative assessment. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.
With respect to definite-lived intangible assets, we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of such assets. If such events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, management would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) were less than the carrying amount of the assets, we would recognize an impairment charge to reduce such assets to their fair value. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, no impairment charges were recorded related to our definite-lived intangible assets.
Income Taxes
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. Under GAAP, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases) to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a non-cash charge to income tax expense of $10.2 million that resulted from the establishment of a full valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income or tax liability in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record additional adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations.
We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is: (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our results of operations.
Business Acquisitions
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically engage a third-party valuation firm. There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. For intangible assets, we historically have utilized the income method. The income method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method (or other methods) include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows. Estimating the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives, influenced by the nature of the asset, competitive environment and rate of change in the industry. All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact the determination of the amortization period of the intangible asset, and thus net income. Contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value each reporting period using discount rates, probabilities of payment and projected payment dates. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in the timing or likelihood of achieving value-enhancing milestones and changes in discount periods and rates. Projected contingent payment amounts are discounted back to the current period using a discount cash flow model. For further disclosures related to acquisitions and contingent consideration, see Notes 2, 5 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
