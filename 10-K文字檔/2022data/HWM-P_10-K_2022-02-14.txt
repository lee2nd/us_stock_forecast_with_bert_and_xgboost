(dollars in millions, except share and per-share amounts)
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
Overview
Our Business
Howmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Howmet’s innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets.
Howmet is a global company operating in 20 countries. Based upon the country where the point of shipment occurred, the United States and Europe generated 68% and 22%, respectively, of Howmet’s sales in 2021. In addition, Howmet has operating activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States and Europe, including Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in countries with such activities.
Management Review of 2021 and Outlook
In 2021, Sales decreased 5% over 2020 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace market driven by the impact of COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines, and lower sales volumes in the defense aerospace market, partially offset by growth in the commercial transportation and industrial gas turbine markets as well as favorable product pricing of $97. Price increases are in excess of material and inflationary pass through to our customers.
Segment operating profit increased 6% from 2020 due to favorable sales volumes in the commercial transportation and industrial gas turbine markets, cost reductions, and favorable product pricing, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace market driven by the impact of COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines and lower sales volumes in the defense aerospace market.
Effective October 14, 2021, John C. Plant assumed the position of sole Chief Executive Officer and continued in his role as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Tolga Oal, the Company’s prior Co-Chief Executive Officer, departed the Company and also stepped down from the Board, each effective as of October 14, 2021. The Company has aligned its operations consistent with how the Chief Executive Officer assesses operating performance and allocates capital, which remain unchanged since the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has also continued its intensified focus on capital efficiency. Management’s focus and the related results enabled Howmet to end 2021 with a solid financial position.
The following financial information reflects certain key highlights of Howmet’s 2021 results:
•Sales of $4,972, a decrease of 5% from 2020, with significant reductions in sales in commercial aerospace driven by COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines;
•Net income from continuing operations of $258, or $0.59 per diluted share;
•Income from continuing operations before income taxes of $324, an increase of $153, or 89%, from 2020;
•Total segment operating profit of $939, an increase of $49, or 6%, from 2020(1);
•Cash provided from operations of $449; cash used for financing activities of $1,444; and cash provided from investing activities of $107;
•Purchased approximately 13 million shares of Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Programs for approximately $430;
•Cash on hand and restricted cash at the end of the year of $722;
•Total debt of $4,232, a decrease of $843 from 2020, reflecting redemptions or repurchases, as applicable, of $361, $476, $600, and $100 of the 5.400% Notes due 2021 (the “5.400% Notes”), the 5.870% Notes due 2022 (the “5.870% Notes”), the 6.875% Notes due 2025 (the “6.875% Notes”), and the 5.125% Notes due 2024 (the “5.125% Notes”), respectively, during 2021, partially offset by issuance of $700 of the 3.000% Notes due 2029 during 2021; and
•The Company’s common stock had a closing price of $31.38 per share at December 31, 2021, an increase of $18.63 per share, or 141%, since the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction on April 1, 2020, compared to an increase of 93% and 51% for the S&P 500® Index and S&P Aerospace & Defense Index, respectively, over the same period.
(1) See below in Results of Operations for the reconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.
In 2022, management projects sales to increase as we expect robust growth in most of the Company’s key markets, and the Company’s strong position in those markets is expected to continue. The Company expects higher metal costs to also contribute to increased sales in 2022. Earnings per share is expected to grow as management continues to focus on operational performance. Cash provided from operations is expected to increase for the full year in 2022 compared with 2021, resulting from a continued focus on operating performance and on capital efficiency. Capital expenditures are expected to be less than depreciation and amortization.
Results of Operations
Earnings Summary
Sales. Sales for 2021 were $4,972 compared with $5,259 in 2020, a decrease of $287, or 5%. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace market driven by the impact of COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines and lower sales volumes in the defense aerospace market, partially offset by growth in the commercial transportation and industrial gas turbine markets as well as favorable product pricing of $97. Price increases are in excess of material and inflationary pass through to our customers.
Sales for 2020 were $5,259 compared with $7,098 in 2019, a decrease of $1,839, or 26%. The decrease was primarily a result of lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets driven by the impacts of COVID-19 and Boeing 737 MAX (“737 MAX”) and Boeing 787 production declines along with a decrease in sales of $116 due to the divestiture of the forgings business in the U.K. in December 2019, all partially offset by growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets and favorable product pricing.
Cost of goods sold (“COGS”). COGS as a percentage of Sales was 72.3% in 2021 compared with 73.7% in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to structural cost reductions and favorable product pricing. In 2019, the Company sustained a fire at a Fastening Systems plant in France (“France Plant Fire”). Additionally, a fire occurred at a Forged Wheels plant in Barberton, Ohio in mid-February 2020 (“Barberton Plant Fire”). The Company submitted insurance claims related to these plant fires and received partial settlements of $32 in 2021 compared to $39 in 2020, which were in excess of the insurance deductible. In 2021, the Company recorded charges of $28 related to plant fires compared to $41 in 2020. The downtime in 2021 and 2020 reduced production levels and affected productivity at the plants. The Company anticipates additional charges related to these plant fires of approximately $5 to $15 in 2022.
COGS as a percentage of Sales was 73.7% in 2020 compared with 73.5% in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower sales volumes, partially offset by net cost savings, favorable product pricing, intentional product exits, and the impairment of energy business assets of $10 in the second quarter of 2019. The Company submitted insurance claims related to the France Plant Fire and the Barberton Plant Fire, and received partial settlements of $39 in 2020 compared to $25 in 2019, which were in excess of the insurance deductible. In 2020, the Company recorded charges of $41 related to the plant fires compared to $26 in 2019. The downtime reduced production levels and affected productivity at the plants.
Selling, general administrative, and other expenses (“SG&A”). SG&A expenses were $251, or 5.0% of Sales, in 2021 compared with $277, or 5.3% of Sales, in 2020. The decrease in SG&A of $26, or 9%, was primarily due to overhead cost reductions in 2021 and costs incurred in 2020 associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction.
SG&A expenses were $277, or 5.3% of Sales, in 2020 compared with $400, or 5.6% of Sales, in 2019. The decrease in SG&A of $123, or 31%, was primarily due to overhead cost reductions and lower net legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $20, partially offset by higher costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction through June 30, 2020 of $2.
Research and development expenses (“R&D”). R&D expenses were $17 in both 2021 and 2020.
R&D expenses were $17 in 2020 compared with $28 in 2019. The decrease of $11, or 39%, was primarily due to the consolidation of the Company's primary R&D facility in conjunction with ongoing cost reduction efforts.
Provision for depreciation and amortization (“D&A”). The provision for D&A was $270 in 2021 compared with $279 in 2020. The decrease of $9, or 3%, was primarily driven by lower corporate software amortization and research center depreciation as well as $1 of D&A related to the Barberton Plant Fire in 2021 compared to $6 in 2020.
The provision for D&A was $279 in 2020 compared with $295 in 2019. The decrease of $16, or 5%, was primarily driven by asset impairments of the Disks long-lived asset group during the second quarter of 2019 (see Note O and Note P to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K) and the impact of divestitures, as well as lower corporate software amortization and research center depreciation, which were partially offset by increased Forged Wheels D&A due to the capacity expansion in Hungary, capacity expansions at two U.S. facilities and an additional $6 of D&A related to the Barberton Plant Fire.
Restructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges were $90 in 2021 compared with $182 in 2020 and $582 in 2019.
Restructuring and other charges in 2021 consisted primarily of a $75 charge for U.K. and U.S. pension plans’ settlement accounting, a $15 charge for accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of small U.S. manufacturing facilities in Engine Products and Fastening Systems, a $7 charge for layoff costs, a $4 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell a small manufacturing business in France, and a $4 charge for various other exit costs. These charges were partially offset by a gain of $12 on the sale of assets at a small U.S. manufacturing facility in Fastening Systems and a benefit of $3 related to the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods. The Company has closed some small manufacturing facilities and may in the future close additional small facilities in order to consolidate operations, reduce fixed costs, and exit less profitable businesses.
Restructuring and other charges in 2020 consisted primarily of a $113 charge for layoff costs, a $74 charge for U.K. and U.S. pension plans' settlement accounting, a $5 post-closing adjustment related to the sale of the Company’s U.K. forgings business, a $5 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell an aerospace components business in the U.K, which ultimately did not occur and the business was returned to held for use, a $5 charge related to the impairment of a cost method investment, which were partially offset by a benefit of $21 related to the reversal of a number of prior period programs.
Restructuring and other charges in 2019 consisted primarily of a $428 charge for impairment of the Disks long-lived asset group, a $69 charge for layoff costs, a $46 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell the U.K. forgings business, a $14 charge for impairment of properties, plants, and equipment related to the Company’s primary research and development facility, a $13 loss on sale of assets primarily related to a small additive business, a $12 charge for other exit costs from lease terminations primarily related to the exit of the corporate aircraft, a $9 settlement accounting charge for U.S. pension plans, a $5 charge for impairment of a cost method investment, and a $7 charge for other exit costs, which were partially offset by a benefit of $16 related to the elimination of the life insurance benefit for U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $259 in 2021 compared with $317 in 2020. The decrease of $58, or 18%, was primarily due to a reduced average level of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. On an annual basis, the debt activity in 2021 will decrease Interest expense, net by approximately $70.
Interest expense, net was $317 in 2020 compared with $338 in 2019. The decrease of $21, or 6%, was primarily due to a reduced average level of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
Loss on debt redemption. Debt redemption or tender premiums include the cost to redeem or repurchase certain of the Company’s notes at a price which may be equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, or a price based on the market price of its notes. Loss on debt redemption was $146 in 2021 compared with $64 in 2020. The increase of $82, or 128%, was primarily due to debt premiums paid in 2021 on the 6.875% Notes in 2021, partially offset by debt redemption or tender premiums, as applicable, paid in 2020 on the 6.150% Notes due 2020 (the “6.150% Notes”) and the 5.400% Notes.
Loss on debt redemption was $64 in 2020 compared with none in 2019. The increase of $64 was primarily due to debt redemption or tender premiums paid, as applicable, on the 6.150% Notes, the 5.400% Notes, and the 5.870% Notes in 2020.
See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
Other expense, net. Other expense, net was $19 in 2021 compared with $74 in 2020. The decrease in expense of $55 was primarily driven by the write-off of an indemnification receivable of $53 related to a Spanish tax reserve, reflecting Alcoa Corporation's 49% share and Arconic Corporation's 33.66% share, that occurred in 2020 and did not occur in 2021 and lower non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans in 2021 of $17, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements of $13. Non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans declined approximately 65% from 2020 to 2021.
Other expense, net was $74 in 2020 compared with $31 in 2019. The increase in expense of $43 was primarily driven by the write-off of an indemnification receivable of $53 related to a Spanish tax reserve, reflecting Alcoa Corporation's 49% share and Arconic Corporation's 33.66% share, and lower interest income of $19, which were partially offset by lower deferred compensation expense of $14 and favorable foreign currency movements of $16.
Income taxes. Howmet’s effective tax rate was 20.4% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2021 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $32 benefit from the recognition of income tax credits related to development incentives in Hungary, and a $9 benefit related to updated U.S. regulatory guidance concerning the utilization of foreign tax credits in connection with the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of previously non-taxed post-1986 earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries enacted as part of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Act”), partially offset by $9 of charges from the decision to no longer permanently reinvest earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries, $7 of charges from distributions of foreign earnings, $8 of charges to establish a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses in Switzerland, $6 of charges related to U.S. tax on foreign income, and other impacts related to nondeductible expenses including foreign losses with no tax benefit. Howmet anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 24.5% and 25.5%.
Howmet’s effective tax rate was 23.4% (benefit on pre-tax income) in 2020 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $64 benefit related to the release of an income tax reserve following a favorable Spanish tax case decision, a $30 benefit related to the recognition of a previously uncertain U.S. tax position, and a $30 benefit for a U.S. tax law change related to the issuance of final regulations that provide for an exclusion of certain high-taxed foreign earnings from the calculation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings, $8 of charges related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances as a result of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the tax impact of $49 of nondeductible loss related to the reversal of indemnification receivables associated with the favorable Spanish tax case decision, and the tax impact of other nondeductible expenses.
Howmet’s effective tax rate was 40.0% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2019 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of foreign income taxed in higher rate jurisdictions and subject to U.S. taxes including GILTI, foreign losses with no tax benefit, and other nondeductible expenses, partially offset by a $24 benefit associated with the deduction of foreign taxes that were previously claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit, and a $12 benefit for a foreign tax rate change.
Net income from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations was $258, or $0.59 per diluted share, for 2021 compared to $211, or $0.48 per diluted share, in 2020. The increase in results of $47, or 22%, was primarily due to cost reductions, a decrease of $92 in Restructuring and other charges, and a decrease of $58 in Interest expense, net, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace and defense aerospace market, an increase in the Provision for income taxes, and an increase in the Loss on debt redemption of $82.
Net income from continuing operations was $211, or $0.48 per diluted share, for 2020 compared to $126, or $0.27 per diluted share, in 2019. The increase in results of $85, or 67%, was primarily due to the non-recurring 2019 impact of the $428 charge for impairment of the Disks long-lived asset group included in Restructuring and other charges, a decrease of $123 due to lower SG&A costs, favorable product pricing, and a net $10 related to the settlement of the Spanish corporate income tax audit, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, the impact of COVID-19, and an increase in premiums paid on the early redemption of debt of $59.
Net income. Net income was $258 for 2021, all of which was composed of $258 of income from continuing operations, or $0.59 per diluted share.
Net income was $261 for 2020, composed of $211 of income from continuing operations and $50 from discontinued operations, or $0.48 and $0.11 per diluted share, respectively.
Net income was $470 for 2019, composed of $126 of income from continuing operations and $344 from discontinued operations, or $0.27 and $0.76 per diluted share, respectively.
See details of discontinued operations in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
Segment Information
The Company’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures and Forged Wheels. Segment performance under Howmet’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Howmet’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and other charges and Impairment of Goodwill. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in Corporate. The Company has aligned its operations consistent with how the Chief Executive Officer assesses operating performance and allocates capital, which remain unchanged since the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for reference).
The Company produces aerospace engine parts and components and aerospace fastening systems for 737 MAX airplanes. In late December 2019, Boeing announced a temporary suspension of the production of 737 MAX airplanes. This decline in production had a negative impact on sales and segment operating profit in the Engine Products, Fastening Systems and Engineered Structures segments in 2020 and the first half of 2021. While regulatory authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions lifted grounding orders beginning in late 2020, our sales remained at lower levels through the first half of 2021 due to the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding.
The Company also produces aerospace engine parts and components and aerospace fastening systems for Boeing 787 airplanes. In 2020 and 2021, Boeing reduced production rates of the 787 airplanes. Boeing paused deliveries of its 787 aircraft in May 2021. The significant decline in Boeing 787 production rates had a negative impact on sales and segment operating profit in the Engine Products, Fastening Systems, and Engineered Structures segments in 2021. We expect reduced production rates to continue to have a negative impact on our sales and segment operating profit into 2022.
Income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled $324 in 2021, $171 in 2020, and $210 in 2019. Segment operating profit for all reportable segments totaled $939 in 2021, $890 in 2020, and $1,390 in 2019. See below for the reconciliation of Income from continuing operations before income taxes to Total segment operating profit.
The following information provides Sales and Segment operating profit for each reportable segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021.

Segment operating profit for the Fastening Systems segment decreased $149, or 38%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial aerospace and commercial transportation sales volumes and COVID-19 productivity impacts, partially offset by cost reductions and favorable product pricing.
In 2022, as compared to 2021, demand in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets is expected to increase.
Engineered Structures
Engineered Structures produces titanium ingots and mill products for aerospace and defense applications and is vertically integrated to produce titanium forgings, extrusions forming and machining services for airframe, wing, aero-engine, and landing gear components. Engineered Structures also produces aluminum forgings, nickel forgings, and aluminum machined components, and assemblies for aerospace and defense applications. The segment’s products are sold directly to customers and through distributors, and sales and costs and expenses of this segment are generally transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar and British pound.
Third-party sales for the Engineered Structures segment decreased $202, or 22%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace market, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines, and lower sales volumes in the defense aerospace market, including lower program volumes.
Third-party sales for the Engineered Structures segment decreased $328, or 26%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace market, driven by COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines and the 737 MAX production suspension, partially offset by an increase in defense aerospace sales volumes and favorable product pricing.
Segment operating profit for the Engineered Structures segment decreased $19, or 26%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to lower sales volumes in the commercial aerospace market, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and Boeing 787 production declines, and lower sales volumes in the defense aerospace market, including lower program volumes, partially offset by cost reductions.
Segment operating profit for the Engineered Structures segment decreased $47, or 39%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial aerospace sales volumes and COVID-19 productivity impacts, partially offset by cost reductions and favorable product pricing.
In 2022, as compared to 2021, demand in the commercial aerospace market is expected to increase. However, demand in the defense aerospace market is expected to be down.
Forged Wheels
Forged Wheels produces forged aluminum wheels and related products for heavy-duty trucks, trailers, and buses globally. Forged Wheels' products are sold directly to OEMs and through distributors. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar and Euro.
Third-party sales for the Forged Wheels segment increased $242, or 36%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to higher sales volumes in the commercial transportation market and higher metal prices.
Third-party sales for the Forged Wheels segment decreased $290, or 30%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower sales volumes in the commercial transportation market driven by COVID-19 and production downtime related to the Barberton Plant Fire (discussed below).
Segment operating profit for the Forged Wheels segment increased $102, or 67%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to higher commercial transportation sales volumes, fixed cost reductions, and maximizing production in low-cost countries.
Segment operating profit for the Forged Wheels segment decreased $100, or 40%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial transportation sales volumes and COVID-19 productivity impacts, partially offset by cost reductions.
In mid-February 2020, a fire occurred at the Company’s forged wheels plant located in Barberton, Ohio. The downtime reduced production levels and affected productivity at the plant. The Company has insurance with a deductible of $10.
In 2022, as compared to 2021, demand in the commercial transportation markets served by Forged Wheels is expected to increase in most regions. An increase in metal costs is expected to contribute to an increase in sales as the Company generally passes through metal costs. However, sales in the Forged Wheels segment could be negatively impacted by customer supply chain constraints.
Reconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes
Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the segments of the Company excluding Corporate results.
See Restructuring and other charges, Loss on debt redemption, Interest expense, net and Other expense, net, discussions above under “Results of Operations” for reference.
Corporate expense increased $19, or 23%, in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to costs associated with closures, shutdowns, and other items of $32 and legal and other advisory reimbursements received in 2020 that did not recur in 2021 aggregating to $8, partially offset by lower net costs related to the Barberton Plant Fire and the France Plant Fire of $6 and lower costs driven by overhead cost reductions, as well as costs incurred in 2020 associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction of $7 that did not recur in 2021.
Corporate expense decreased $147, or 64%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower annual incentive compensation accruals and executive compensation costs, lower costs driven by overhead cost reductions, lower contract services and outsourcing costs; lower research and development expenses; and lower net legal and other advisory costs along with costs incurred in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, including the impacts of facility fires, net of insurance of $6, and collective bargaining agreement negotiation costs of $9. Costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction of $7 were an increase of $2 compared to 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Howmet maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and the strengthening of its balance sheet. Management continued to focus on actions to improve Howmet’s cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures.
Cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Howmet's operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see “Contractual Obligations” and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” below.
At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of Howmet were $720, of which $199 was held by Howmet's non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries were to be repatriated to the U.S., the Company does not expect there to be additional material income tax consequences.
The cash flows related to Arconic Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for all periods prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction.
Operating Activities
Cash provided from operations in 2021 was $449 compared with $9 in 2020 and $461 in 2019.
The increase in cash provided from operations of $440, or 4,889%, between 2021 and 2020 was due to lower working capital of $357, lower pension contributions of $161, and lower noncurrent liabilities of $12, partially offset by lower operating results of $38 and the write-off of an indemnification receivable of $53 related to a Spanish tax reserve that occurred in 2020 and did not occur in 2021. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes in accounts payable of $525, accrued expenses of $71, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13, offset by taxes, including income taxes of $139, receivables of $99 including employee retention credit receivables, and inventories of $14.
The decrease in cash provided from operations of $452, or 98%, between 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to lower operating results of $874, partially offset by lower working capital of $355, lower noncurrent assets of $46, lower noncurrent liabilities of $10, and lower pension contributions of $11. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes in receivables of $739, taxes, including income taxes of $100, and inventories of $77, offset by accounts payable of $380, accrued expenses of $175 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.
Financing Activities
Cash used for financing activities was $1,444 in 2021 compared with $369 in 2020 and $1,568 in 2019.
The use of cash in 2021 was primarily related to the repayments on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of long-term debt of approximately $1,537, repurchase of common stock of $430, premiums paid on the redemption of debt of $138, dividends paid to shareholders of $19, and debt issuance costs of $11. These items were partially offset by long-term debt issuance of $700 and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $22. On an annual basis, the debt activity in 2021 will decrease Interest expense, net by approximately $70.
The use of cash in 2020 was primarily related to the repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 6.150% Notes due 2020 of approximately $2,040, cash distributed to Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction of $500, repurchase of common stock of $73, debt issuance costs of $61, premiums paid on the redemption of debt of $59, and dividends paid to shareholders of $11. These items were partially offset by long-term debt issuance of $2,400 (of which $1,200 went with Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction) and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $33.
The use of cash in 2019 was primarily related to the repurchase of $1,150 of common stock, repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the 1.63% Convertible Notes of approximately $403, and dividends paid to shareholders of $57. These items were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $56.
The Company has an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC, which allows for offerings of debt securities from time to time. The Company may opportunistically issue new debt securities under such registration statement or otherwise in accordance with securities laws, including but not limited to in order to refinance existing indebtedness.
For further details regarding the Company’s debt and stock repurchases, see Note R and Note J, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
The Company maintains a credit facility pursuant to its Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. In addition, the Company had other credit facilities that terminated in 2020. See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.
The Company may in the future repurchase additional portions of its debt or equity securities from time to time, in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. Such purchases may be completed by means of trading plans established from time to time in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, block trades, private transactions, open market repurchases, tender offers, and/or accelerated share repurchase agreements or other derivative transactions.
The Company’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to the Company by the major credit rating agencies.
The Company's credit ratings from the three major credit rating agencies are as follows:
On December 3, 2021, S&P affirmed Howmet’s long-term debt rating at BB+ and upgraded the current outlook from negative to stable, citing the Company’s good margins, positive free cash flow, and an anticipated recovery in aircraft demand.
On August 18, 2021, Moody’s affirmed the following ratings for Howmet: long-term debt at Ba2 and the current outlook as stable.
On August 18, 2021, Fitch also affirmed the following ratings for Howmet: long-term debt at BBB- and the current outlook as stable.
Investing Activities
Cash provided from investing activities was $107 in 2021 compared with $271 in 2020 and $528 in 2019.
The source of cash in 2021 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $267 and proceeds from the sale of a small manufacturing plant in France of $8 and the sale of assets at a small U.S. manufacturing facility in Fastening Systems of $23, partially offset by capital expenditures of $199 primarily related to capacity expansion investments in Hungary and Mexico in Forged Wheels and various automation projects. As a result of accounts receivables securitization program changes in 2021, there will be no additional activity related to cash receipts from sold receivables within investing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in future periods. The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivable was neither a use of cash nor a source of cash during 2021.
The source of cash in 2020 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $422 and proceeds from the sale of a rolling mill business in Itapissuma, Brazil of $50 and a hard alloy extrusions plant in South Korea of $62, both of which were related to Arconic Corporation (see Note C and Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), partially offset by capital expenditures of $267.
The source of cash in 2019 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $995, proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses of $103, primarily from the sale of a forgings business in the U.K. for $64 and the sale of inventories and properties, plants, and equipment related to a small energy business for $13, as well as contingent consideration of $20 related to the sale of the Texarkana, Texas rolling mill (which was related to Arconic Corporation) (see Note C and Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), and the sale of fixed income securities of $73, partially offset by capital expenditures of $641, including expansion of a wheels plant in Hungary,
expansion of aerospace airfoils capacity in the United States, and transition of the Tennessee plant to industrial production (which related to Arconic Corporation).
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Contractual Obligations
Howmet is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Howmet also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects.
In order to better understand Howmet’s outstanding contractual obligations, the table below represents a summary of these commitments as of December 31, 2021 (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information):
Obligations for Operating Activities
Raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, cobalt, nickel, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to five years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. The Company generally passes through metal costs in customer contracts with limited exceptions. As a result, the Company expects higher metal costs to contribute to increased sales in 2022. In connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the Company entered into several agreements with Arconic Corporation that govern the relationship between the Company and Arconic Corporation following the separation, including raw material supply agreements.
Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.
Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042.
Estimated minimum required pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates, among others. It is Howmet’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in the benefits laws and tax laws of the applicable country. Periodically, Howmet contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. Howmet has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2026 and 2031, respectively.
Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs.
Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2021. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “Thereafter” column as the Company is not
able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.
Obligations for Financing Activities
Howmet has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. The Company paid an aggregate of $19 in common stock and preferred stock dividends to shareholders during 2021. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Howmet’s Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2021, there were 421,691,912 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding Class A preferred stock. In 2021, the preferred stock dividend was $3.75 per share. A dividend of $0.04 per share on the Company’s common stock was paid in 2021 ($0.02 per share in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021). Fully diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were 427,526,370.
Obligations for Investing Activities
Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2021. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 4% of sales in 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2022 and 2040, was $15 at December 31, 2021.
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, between Howmet and Alcoa Corporation, Howmet was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $6 and $12 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining guarantee, for which the Company and Arconic Corporation are secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation, relates to a long-term energy supply agreement that expires in 2047 at an Alcoa Corporation facility. The Company currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote. The Company and Arconic Corporation are required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,406 and $1,398 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In December 2021 and 2020, a surety bond with a limit of $80 relating to this guarantee was obtained by Alcoa Corporation to protect Howmet's obligation. This surety bond is expected to be renewed on an annual basis by Alcoa Corporation.
Howmet has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2022, was $119 at December 31, 2021.
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreements between the Company and Arconic Corporation and between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is required to retain letters of credit of $53 (which are included in the $119 in the above paragraph) that had previously been provided related to the Company, Arconic Corporation, and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims that occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of April 1, 2020 and November 1, 2016. Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation and letter of credit fees paid by the Company are proportionally billed to, and are reimbursed by, Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation, respectively. Also, the Company was required to provide letters of credit for certain Arconic Corporation environmental obligations and, as a result, the Company has $17 of outstanding letters of credit relating to such liabilities (which are included in the $119 in the above paragraph). Less than $1 of these outstanding letters of credit are pending cancellation and will be deemed cancelled once returned by the beneficiary. Arconic Corporation has issued surety bonds to cover these environmental obligations. Arconic Corporation is being billed for these letter of credit fees paid by the Company and will reimburse the Company for any payments made under these letters of credit.
Howmet has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these annual surety bonds, which expire and automatically renew at various dates, primarily in 2022 and 2023, was $47 at December 31, 2021.
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreements between the Company and Arconic Corporation and between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is required to provide surety bonds of $25 (which are included in the $47 in the above paragraph) that had previously been provided related to the Company, Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims paid that occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of April 1, 2020 and
November 1, 2016. Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by the Company are proportionally billed to, and are reimbursed by Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations relating to the impact of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 is rapidly changing and of unknown duration and macroeconomic impact and as a result, these considerations remain highly uncertain. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.
Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.
Goodwill. Howmet reviews goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. The Company has the option to assess impairment through qualitative assessment, which includes factors such as general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. Howmet can also assess goodwill impairment through a quantitative analysis, using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. Assumptions and estimates utilized in the DCF model include weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) rates, revenue, future profitability, working capital, cash flows and a number of other items. For more information on these matters, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.
Properties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments.
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company updated its five-year strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the Disks asset group within the Engine Products and Forgings segment at that time. As such, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the Disks asset group long-lived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows of the Disks asset group. The carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the Disks asset group long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the long-lived assets, with fair value determined using a DCF model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods, including an estimate for economic obsolescence. The impairment charge of $428, of which $247 and $181 related to the Engine Products and Engineered Structures segments, respectively, which was recorded in the second quarter of 2019, impacted properties, plants, and equipment; intangible assets; and certain other noncurrent assets by $198, $197, and $33, respectively. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.
Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair
value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). The pension and other postretirement benefits obligation was $2,461 and $2,928, with a funded status of $(930) and $(1,204) at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total benefit obligation reduction of $467 was primarily driven by the purchases of annuity contracts and changes in discount rate. The improvement in the funded status of $274 was primarily driven by the purchase of annuity contracts, changes in discount rates, and actual asset returns in excess of expected asset returns. Excluding settlements and curtailments, net periodic benefit cost of pension and other postretirement benefits is expected to be approximately $20 in 2022 compared to $16 and $35 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net periodic benefit costs decreased by $19, or 54%, in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of actual asset returns in excess of expected asset returns, changes in discount rates, and changes in plan administration of prescription drug benefits.
Employer contributions for pension benefits were $96 and $227 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Benefits paid for other postretirement benefits were $17 for both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Total pension contributions and other postretirement benefits paid decreased by $131, or 54%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction. Cash contributions in 2022 are expected to be $44 and represent estimated minimum required pension funding. Howmet’s funded status under ERISA was approximately 76% as of January 1, 2021.
The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities for the U.S. is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary, while both the U.K. and Canada utilize models developed by the respective actuary. The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve models parallel the plans’ projected cash flows, which have a global average duration of 11 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the models exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 2.70%, 2.40%, and 3.00%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $70 and either a charge or credit of less than $1 to earnings in the following year.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.
For 2021, 2020, and 2019, management used 6.20%, 6.00%, and 5.60%, respectively, as its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates were within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In the current year, the actual rate of return on plan assets was 7.2%. The increase in expected long-term rate of return of plan assets compared to prior years is due to an increased portion of plan assets within U.S. plans and corresponding asset allocations. For 2022, management anticipates that the expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets will be approximately 6.00%. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact earnings by approximately $3 for 2022.
In 2021, net income of $181 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the increase in the discount rate, plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and amortization of actuarial losses. In 2020, a net loss of $46 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and by amortization of actuarial losses. After adjusting for the impact of Arconic Corporation's obligation, the net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation decreased less than 2% during 2020. In 2019, a net loss of $388 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and by the amortization of actuarial losses.
Stock-Based Compensation. Howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.
Compensation expense recorded in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $40 ($36 after-tax), $46 ($42 after-tax), and $69 ($63 after-tax), respectively.
Income Taxes. The provision (benefit) for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision (benefit) for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) based on current year pre-tax income plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Howmet’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Howmet’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.
It is Howmet’s policy to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.
It is Howmet’s policy to treat taxes due from future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred.
Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.
Litigation and Contingent Liabilities. From time to time, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings. These matters may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors, such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. If an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and the amount of the potential loss can be estimated, the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed probable but the loss is not reasonably estimable, or if an unfavorable outcome is deemed reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed but no liability is recorded. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.
