ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Summary
Our consolidated operations consist of our CoreCard Software subsidiary and its affiliate companies in Romania, India, Dubai and Colombia as well as a corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support to CoreCard.
We provide technology solutions and processing services to the financial services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. We derive our product revenue from licensing our comprehensive suite of financial transaction management software to financial institutions, retailers, processors and accounts receivable businesses to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, fleet cards, buy now pay later programs, loyalty programs, and accounts receivable and loan transactions. Our service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support for licensed software products, fees for processing services that we provide to companies that outsource their financial transaction processing functions to us, and professional services primarily for software customizations provided to both license and processing customers.
Our results vary in part depending on the size and number of software licenses recognized as well as the value and number of professional services contracts recognized in a particular period. As we continue to grow our Processing Services business, we continue to gain economies of scale on the investment we have made in the infrastructure, resources, processes and software features developed over the past number of years to support this growing side of our business. We are adding new processing customers at a faster pace than we are adding new license customers, resulting in steady growth in the processing revenue stream. However, we also receive license revenue and are experiencing growth in our professional services revenue due to the addition of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as a customer in 2018, referred to as “Customer A” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In total, this customer represented 71 percent and 69 percent of our consolidated revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect future professional services, maintenance and license revenue from this customer in 2022 and future years; however, the amount and timing will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization needed by the customer. License revenue from this customer, similar to other license arrangements, is tiered based on the number of active accounts on the system. Once the customer achieves each tier level, they receive a perpetual license up to that number of accounts; inactive accounts do not count toward the license tier. The customer receives an unlimited perpetual license at a maximum tier level that allows them to utilize the software for any number of active accounts. They currently use the software for a single institution and additional license fees apply if multiple institutions are added, which occurred in the first quarter of 2022. Support and maintenance fees are charged based on the tier level achieved and increase at new tier levels.
During 2020, we experienced the loss of a large customer due to insolvency, referred to as “Customer C” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognized revenue of $605,000, $845,000 and $3,700,000 from this customer for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not expect any future revenue from this customer. We opened an office in Dubai in November 2020 and hired some of the insolvent company’s employees with significant payments industry experience and experience operating CoreCard’s Processing platforms in the related regions, and we converted some of their customers to our processing platform.
We typically receive revenue based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume and therefore the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown had a muted impact on our results. Most of our employees in India worked remotely throughout the pandemic which impacted our ability to hire and train new employees. We maintained key functions and business continuity while delivering growth in our professional services revenue and expect to hire a significant number of new employees in India in 2022 to enable new and existing customer growth.
The infrastructure of our multi customer environment is scalable for the future. A significant portion of our expense is related to personnel, including more than 750 employees located in India, Romania, Dubai and Colombia. In 2017, we opened a second office in India, located near Mumbai, to enable us to attract the level of talent required for our software development and testing. In October 2020, we opened an office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates to support CoreCard’s expansion of processing services into new markets in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European regions. In October 2021, we opened a new location in Bogotá, Colombia where we expect to hire technical personnel to support existing customers and continued growth. Our ability to hire and train employees on our processes and software impacts our ability to onboard new customers and deliver professional services for software customizations. In addition, we have certain corporate office expenses associated with being a public company that impact our operating results.
Our revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods. It is difficult to predict the level of consolidated revenue on a quarterly basis for various reasons, including the following:
●
Software license revenue in a given period may consist of a relatively small number of contracts, and contract values can vary considerably depending on the software product and scope of the license sold. Consequently, even minor delays in delivery under a software contract, which may be out of our control, could have a significant and unpredictable impact on the consolidated revenue that we recognize in a given quarterly or annual period.
●
Customers may decide to postpone or cancel a planned implementation of our software for any number of reasons, which may be unrelated to our software or contract performance, that may affect the amount, timing and characterization of our deferred and/or recognized revenue.
●
Customers typically require our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based on their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to period.
●
The timing of new processing customer implementations is often dependent on third party approvals or processes which are typically not under our direct control.
We continue to maintain a strong cash position. We intend to use cash balances to support the domestic and international operations associated with our CoreCard business and to expand our operations in the FinTech industry through financing the growth of CoreCard and, if appropriate opportunities become available, through acquisitions of businesses in this industry. In November 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million, all of which has been utilized. In April 2021, the Board authorized an additional $10 million for our share repurchase program, of which $6.3 million has been utilized. We made share repurchases of $9.7 million in 2021, and $1.6 million in repurchases in 2020. We have $3.7 million of authorized share repurchases remaining at December 31, 2021.
Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report.
Revenue - Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $48,248,000 which represents a 34 percent increase over 2020.
●
Revenue from services was $42,383,000 in 2021, which represents a 31 percent increase from 2020 revenue of $32,273,000. Revenue from transaction processing services, software maintenance and support services, and professional services were greater in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to an increase in the number of customers and accounts on file and an increase in the number and value of professional services contracts completed in 2021. We expect that processing services will continue to grow as our customer base increases; however, the time required to implement new customer programs could be delayed due to third party integration and approval processes and other factors. It is difficult to predict with accuracy the number and value of professional services contracts that our customers will require in a given period. Customers typically request our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based on their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to period.
●
Revenue from products, which includes software license fees, was $5,865,000 in 2021, an increase of 63 percent from 2020 revenue of $3,600,000. The increase results from more customers achieving new license tiers in 2021 than in 2020.
Cost of Revenue - Total cost of revenue was 47 percent of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 43 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by investments made in our processing infrastructure in 2020 and 2021 including hardware and software purchases and additional space in our data centers. Cost of revenue includes costs to provide annual maintenance and support services to our installed base of licensed customers, costs to provide professional services and costs to provide our financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on such revenues can vary considerably from period to period depending on the customer mix, customer requirements and project complexity as well as the mix of our U.S. and offshore employees working on the various aspects of services provided. In addition, we continue to devote the resources necessary to support our growing processing business, including direct costs for regulatory compliance, infrastructure, network certifications and customer support. Investments in our infrastructure in 2020 and 2021 are in anticipation of adding customers in future periods. As such, we will not experience economies of scale unless we add additional customers, as anticipated. This may be subject to change in the future if new regulations or processing standards are implemented causing us to incur additional costs to comply.
Operating Expenses - For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, total operating expenses from consolidated operations were higher as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to higher research and development expenses and higher general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses were higher mainly due to payroll for additional offshore technical personnel and hardship bonus payments related to the pandemic’s impact on our offshore employees. Additionally, we hired onshore technical personnel to work on the development of an updated platform. General and administrative expenses increased due to higher salaries expenses due to an increase in headcount. Marketing expenses increased 111 percent in 2021. Our client base increased in 2021 and 2020 with minimal marketing efforts as we continue to have prospects contact us via online searches and industry referrals; however, we will continue to re-evaluate our marketing expenditures as needed to competitively position the Processing Services business.
Investment Income (Loss) - Investment Income (Loss) was a loss of $172,000 in 2021 and loss of $1,044,000 in 2020. The 2020 investment losses primarily relate to first quarter 2020 impairment charges on investments resulting from the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and losses on equity method investments. We did not record any impairments in 2021.
Other Income, net - Other Income, net was $277,000 in 2021 and $378,000 in 2020. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest income resulting from a lower cash balance and lower interest rates.
Income Taxes - We recorded income tax expense of $2,724,000 and $2,468,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, an effective tax rate of 23.2% in both years. We expect our future effective tax rate to be within the range of 23-25%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash balance at December 31, 2021 was $29,244,000 compared to $37,956,000 at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operations was $8,915,000 compared to cash provided by operations of $20,966,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance, a decrease in cash held for program management funding, higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher accrued payroll and deferred revenue. In addition, during the second quarter of 2021, we invested $1,000,000 in a privately held supply chain financing company. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we made an $800,000 investment in a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry, which is described in more detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $5,425,000 of cash to acquire computer equipment and related software primarily to enhance our existing processing environment in the U.S. as well for computer equipment for the technical resources added in our India office.
We do not expect to pay any regular or special dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand as well as projected customer payments to support our operations and capital equipment purchases in the foreseeable future. Currently we expect to use cash in excess of what is required for our current operations for opportunities we believe will expand our FinTech business, as exemplified in transactions described in Notes 3 and 5, although there can be no assurance that appropriate opportunities will arise. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million in November 2018, all of which has been utilized, and an additional $10 million of share repurchases in April 2021. We made share repurchases of $9.7 million in 2021, and $1.6 million in share repurchases in 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition - Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing services; professional services for software customization, consulting, and training; reimbursable expenses; and software maintenance and customer support.
Our software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories:
●
an initial contract with the customer to license certain software modules, to provide services to get the customer live on the software (such as training and customization) and to provide post contract support (“PCS”) for a specified period of time thereafter,
●
purchase of additional licenses for new modules or for tier upgrades for a higher volume of licensed accounts after the initial contract,
●
other optional standalone contracts, usually performed after the customer is live on the software, for services such as new interfaces or custom features requested by the customer, additional training and problem resolution not covered in annual maintenance contracts, or
●
contracts for certain licensed software products that involve an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees during the contract life.
At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A performance obligation is distinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. To identify our performance obligations, we consider all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Our revenue recognition policies for each of the situations described above are discussed below.
Our software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be functional intellectual property. Additionally, the purpose in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide the customer a right to use our intellectual property. Our software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. Initial implementation fees do not meet the criteria for separate accounting because the software usually requires significant modification or customization that is essential to its functionality. We recognize revenue related to implementations over the life of the customer once the implementation is complete.
We account for the PCS element contained in the initial contract based on relative standalone selling price, which is annual renewal fees for such services, and PCS is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the contract as we generally satisfy these performance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is no discernible pattern of performance. Upon renewal of the PCS contract by the customer, we recognize revenues ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the PCS contract. All of our software customers purchase software maintenance and support contracts and renew such contracts annually.
Certain initial software contracts contain specified future service elements for scheduled completion following the implementation, and related recognition, of the initial license. In these instances, after the initial license recognition, where distinct future performance obligations are identified in the contract and we could reliably measure the completion of each identified performance obligation, we have recognized revenue at the time the individual performance obligation was completed.
Purchases of additional licenses for tier upgrades or additional modules are generally recognized as license revenue in the period in which the purchase is made for perpetual licenses or ratably over the remaining contract term for non-perpetual licenses.
Services provided under standalone contracts that are optional to the customer and are outside of the scope of the initial contract are single element services contracts. These standalone services contracts are not essential to the functionality of the software contained in the initial contract and generally do not include acceptance clauses or refund rights as may be included in the initial software contracts, as described above. Revenues from these services contracts, which are generally performed within a relatively short period of time, are recognized when the services are complete or in some cases as the services are provided. These revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed. Payment terms for professional services may be based on an upfront fixed fee with the remainder due upon completion or on a time and materials basis.
For contracts for licensed software which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for software usage, maintenance and support, we recognize the total fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue.
Revenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, number of accounts on the system, number of hours of services or computer resources used. For processing services which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for services, we recognize the initial fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base tier representing a minimum monthly usage fee. For processing services revenues, we stand ready to provide continuous access to our processing platforms and perform an unspecified quantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified term or terms. Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. We typically satisfy our processing services performance obligations over time as the services are provided.
Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our products or service offerings. We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party. We determine whether we are responsible for providing the actual product or service as a principal, or for arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or the agent by evaluating whether we have control of the product or service prior to it being transferred to the customer. The principal versus agent assessment is performed at the performance obligation level. Indicators that we consider in determining if we have control include whether we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified product or service to the customer, whether we have inventory risk and discretion in establishing the price the customer ultimately pays for the product or service. Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, we have arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and other arrangements where we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained.
Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales tax.
Deferred revenue consists of advance payments by software customers for annual or quarterly PCS, advance payments from customers for software licenses and professional services not yet delivered, and initial implementation payments for processing services or bundled license and support services in multi-year contracts. Deferred revenue is classified as long-term until such time that it becomes likely that the services or products will be provided within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Valuation of Investments - We hold minority interests in non-publicly traded companies whose values are not readily determinable and are based on management’s estimate of realizability of the value of the investment. Future adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results, lack of progress of the investee company or its inability to raise capital to support its business plan could result in investment losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investment. Our policy with respect to minority interests is to record an impairment charge when we conclude an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. At least quarterly, we review our investments to determine any impairment in their carrying value and we write-down any impaired asset at quarter-end to our best estimate of its current realizable value.
We have an equity investment with a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry. In 2021, the company transferred its advisory business to a new entity. We contributed our note receivable of $2,806,000 and $800,000 of cash for a 28% stake in the new entity. We continue to hold a 40% ownership interest in the original company which will continue with its events and media operations. We performed valuations of our investments in these two companies. As a result, we determined that our investments were not impaired and no adjustment was required under the applicable accounting standards. We evaluate on a continuing basis whether any impairment indicators are present that would require additional analysis or write-downs of the investment. While we have not recorded an impairment related to these investments as of December 31, 2021, variations from current expectations could impact future assessments resulting in future impairment charges.
We also have an investment with a privately held technology company and program manager in the FinTech industry. In the first quarter of 2020, due to the economic downturn resulting from the recent pandemic, we recorded an impairment charge of $750,000 to reduce the carrying value of the investee company to $0.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Factors That May Affect Future Operations
Future operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future results of operations or projected cash requirements. It is difficult to predict future quarterly and annual results with certainty.
Among the numerous factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are the following:
●
Weakness or instability in the global financial markets could have a negative impact due to potential customers (most of whom perform some type of financial services) delaying decisions to purchase software or initiate processing services.
●
Increased federal and state regulations and reluctance by financial institutions to act as sponsor banks for prospective customers could result in losses and additional cash requirements.
●
Our largest customer represented 71% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. In the event of material failures to meet contract obligations related to the services provided, there is risk of breach of contract and loss of the customer and related future revenues. Additionally, loss of the customer and related future revenues could result if they choose an alternative service provider, build an in-house solution, or decide to exit the business or service line that falls under the services that we provide for them.
●
Delays in software development projects could cause our customers to postpone implementations or delay payments, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenue and cash.
●
We could fail to deliver software products which meet the business and technology requirements of our target markets within a reasonable time frame and at a price point that supports a profitable, sustainable business model.
●
Our processing business is impacted, directly or indirectly, by more regulations than our licensed software business. If we fail to provide services that comply with (or allow our customers to comply with) applicable regulations or processing standards, we could be subject to financial or other penalties that could negatively impact our business.
●
A security breach in our platform could expose confidential information of our customers’ account holders, hackers could seize our digital infrastructure and hold it for ransom or other cyber risk events could occur and create material losses in excess of our insurance coverage.
●
Software errors or poor quality control may delay product releases, increase our costs, result in non-acceptance of our software by customers or delay revenue recognition.
●
We could fail to expand our base of customers as quickly as anticipated, resulting in lower revenue and profits and increased cash needs.
●
We could fail to retain key software developers and managers who have accumulated years of know-how in our target markets and company products or fail to attract and train a sufficient number of new software developers and testers to support our product development plans and customer requirements at projected cost levels.
●
Increasing and changing government regulations in the United States and foreign countries related to such issues as data privacy, financial and credit transactions could require changes to our products and services which could increase our costs and could affect our existing customer relationships or prevent us from getting new customers.
●
Delays in anticipated customer payments for any reason would increase our cash requirements and could adversely impact our profits.
●
Competitive pressures (including pricing, changes in customer requirements and preferences, and competitor product offerings) may cause prospective customers to choose an alternative product solution, resulting in lower revenue and profits (or losses).
●
Our future capital needs are uncertain and depend on a number of factors; additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
●
Volatility in the markets, including as a result of political instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, or pandemics or other natural disasters, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus, could adversely affect future results of operations and could negatively impact the valuation of our investments.
●
Other general economic and political conditions could cause customers to delay or cancel purchases.
