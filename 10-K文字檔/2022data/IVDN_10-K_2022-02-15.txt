Background
Innovative Designs, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was formed on June 25, 2002. We market and sell cold weather clothing products called “Arctic Armor” that are, except for our headwear, made from Insultex, a material with buoyancy, scent block and thermal resistant properties. We offer our House Wrap product line which is also made from Insultex. We obtain Insultex for our cold weather clothing products through a license agreement with the owner and manufacturer of the material. In December 2015, we took delivery of equipment capable of producing our own Insultex We are currently seeking a facility where the equipment can be installed. We intend to use the Insultex from this equipment in the production of our House Wrap product and for the sale of Insultex to others.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, with the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.
The following table shows a comparison of the results of operations between the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020:
Results of Operations
Revenues for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, were $ 225,601 compared to revenues of $202,253 for the comparable period ending October 31, 2020. House Wrap product revenue totaled $ 169,375 for the period compared to $131,285 for fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. Nearly all of the remaining revenues were derived from our Arctic Armor and related product lines which totaled $56,226 for the period compared to revenues of $70,968 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. Revenues are net of returns and discounts. We continue to work on rebuilding our House Wrap product line brand after doing no advertising during the time of the FTC litigation, November 2016 to July 2021, and the effect of the litigation on our products acceptance, in both segments of our business, in the marketplace. We estimate that approximately sixty percent of our cold weather apparel products are sold to outdoor sportsmen, primarily those engaged in ice fishing.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased from $341,132 in fiscal year 2020, to $411,716 in the fiscal year ending October 31, 2021. This increase reflects, in part, an increase in compensation expense as a result rehiring two employees who had been furloughed in 2019, and a increase in professional fees from $ 71,183 in fiscal year 2020, to $86,470 for fiscal year 2020. The majority of these fess are related to the FTC matter.
Our cost of sales decreased from $131,280 as of October 31, 2020, to $96,728 as of October 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, we funded our operations from revenues, loans and private sales of our common stock. During the period , we received $50,000 from the issuance of a convertible promissory note and $333,5000 from the proceeds of the sale of our Common Stock.We will continue to fund our operations from these sources until we are able to produce sales sufficient to cover our cost structure or to secure commercial lending arrangements.
On July 12, 2015, the Company reached an agreement with Ketut Jaya to purchase machinery and equipment utilized to produce the INSULTEX material. The purchase price is $700,000 and to be made in four installments. The first installment of $300,000 is to be made at the execution of the agreement. The second installment of $200,000 is to be made when the machinery and equipment is ready to be shipped to the United States. The third installment of $100,000 is to be made once the machinery and equipment is producing INSULTEX, and the fourth and final installment of $100,000 is to be made after the first commercial production run of INSULTEX is completed. As of October 31, 2016, the Company has made payments of $600,000. In addition to the final payments, the Company will have to have the equipment and machines installed and ensure that the machine can be operated in compliance with environmental regulations. The Company has not made an estimate of the costs required for bringing the machine into compliance, but it is considered to be substantial. Given the expected time and cost of bringing the equipment into production mode and our current financial condition we are unable to estimate when we will be able to do so.
We also must purchase new quality control testing equipment for our House Wrap product line which we estimate will cost approximately $100,000. However, we have not as yest received a quote from the vendor. Once the equipment is built it will have to go through a certification process.
Short Term: We funded our operations with revenues from sales, private sales of our common stock and from loans from our stockholders. We could not access commercial lines of credit during our last fiscal year.
The Company intends to repay these debt obligations with funds it generates from revenues, from the possible sale of its securities either debt or equity, from advances from our stockholders or others. Because we cannot currently access commercial lending facilities, should we not be able to continue to obtain funding from these sources should our revenues decrease, our operations would be severely affected as we would not be able to fund our purchase orders to our suppliers for finished goods. The Company continues to pay its creditors when payments are due.
Long Term: The Company will continue to fund operations from revenues, borrowings and the possible sale of its securities. Should we not be able to continue to rely on these sources our operations would be severely affected as we would not be able to fund our purchase orders to our suppliers for finished goods.
Subsequent to the period in January 2022, the Company received $51,000 from the exercise of warrants and $10,000 from the sale of units consisting of shares of common stock and common stock purchase warrants
