ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Communications Systems, Inc. classifies its business operations into one segment the Services & Support (“S&S”) segment. This segment is comprised of CSI’s JDL Technologies and Ecessa Corporation businesses. With over 30 years of growth and expertise in managed services and SD-WAN solutions in this segment, the Company offers customers:
Technology services and infrastructure in the commercial, healthcare, financial, and education market segments. The Company’s portfolio of technology solutions includes IT managed services supporting client infrastructures from the data center to the desktop, security products and services, cloud migrations, network virtualization and resiliency, wired and wireless network design and implementation, and converged infrastructure configuration and deployment. We also provide these services to a number of commercial, healthcare and education clients.
SD-WAN Never Down® networks, sold as a product or as a recurring service, enable organizations of all sizes to reliably run Internet and cloud-based applications, connect offices worldwide and distribute traffic among a fabric of multiple, diverse ISP links, ensuring business continuity by removing bottlenecks and eliminating network downtime. These capabilities optimize Never Down performance of business-critical applications, aid in lowering IT costs, and make it easier to provision, maintain and support business networks and the applications that run over them.
Key 2021 Developments
The Company’s 2021 sales were $7.0 million, a 13% decrease from 2020 sales of $8.1 million, excluding S&S services provided by S&S to CSI.
The Company’s 2021 net loss from continuing operations was $8.2 million, or ($0.85) per diluted share, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $4.7 million or ($0.51) per diluted share in fiscal 2020.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments of $6.4 million and working capital of $3.9 million compared to cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments of $21.5 million and working capital of $28.3 million at December 31, 2020.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we instituted temporary office closures, implemented shelter-in-place orders and restrictions, instituted a mandatory work from home policy for substantially all office employees, and instituted social distancing work rules for operations personnel that continued to work in our facilities to satisfy customer orders. We experienced supply chain and demand disruptions during 2020 and 2021 and expect the disruption to our supply to continue into 2022, as well as higher logistics and operational costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted below, we also saw delays in orders as some projects are pushed out due to the inability to access locations due to the shutdowns. We may also see a slowdown in our business if one or more of our major customer or suppliers delays its purchase or supplies due to uncertainty in its business operations, encounters difficulties in its production due to employee safety or workforce concerns, is unable to obtain materials or labor from third parties that it needs to complete its projects, and may see a slowdown in our collection of receivables if our customers encounter cash flow difficulties or delay payments to preserve their cash resources. We are continuing to actively monitor the effects and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, liquidity and capital resources. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain at this time.
Forward Looking Statements
In this report and from time to time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, and in other communications to shareholders or the investing public, we may make “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We may make these forward looking statements concerning possible or anticipated future financial performance, business activities, plans, pending claims, investigations or litigation, which are typically preceded by the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends” or similar expressions. For these forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in federal securities laws. Shareholders and the investing public should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance, activities, anticipated results, outcomes or plans to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of a number of these risk factors, please see Item 1A above.
Critical Accounting Policies
Inventory Valuation: We value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Reserves for excess and obsolescence are estimated and recorded to reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value. The amount of the reserve is determined based on historical usage, projected sales information, plans for discontinued products, and other factors. Though management considers these reserves adequate and proper, changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve.
Income Taxes: In the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, management calculates income taxes. This includes estimating the Company’s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the balance sheet. These assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood it will realize these deferred assets from future taxable income. We determine the valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits based upon the expectation of whether the benefits are more likely than not to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).
Goodwill Impairment: We are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment can be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value using a quantitative assessment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
For the quantitative assessment, the Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis and a market-based valuation approach based on comparable public company trading values. The Company believes that accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement. Management’s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions, such as earnings growth rate, require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for these goods or services.
The Company has determined that the following performance obligations identified in its Services & Support segment are transferred over time: managed services and professional services (time and materials (“T&M”) and fixed price). This segment’s managed services performance obligation is a bundled solution, a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are recognized evenly over the term of the contract. T&M professional services arrangements are measured over time with an input method based on hours expended towards satisfying this performance obligation. Fixed price professional service arrangements under a relatively longer-term service will also be measured over time with an input method based on hours expended.
The Company has also identified the following performance obligations within its Services & Support segment that are recognized at a point in time which include resale of third-party hardware and software, installation, arranging for another party to transfer services to the customer, and certain professional services. The resale of third-party hardware and software is recognized at a point in time, when the goods are shipped or delivered to the customer’s location, in accordance with the shipping terms. Installation services are recognized at a point in time when the services are completed. The service the Company provides to arrange for another party to transfer services to the customer is satisfied at a point in time as the Company has transferred control upon the service first being made available to the customer by the third-party vendor, which are required to be presented on a net basis. Depending on the nature of the service, certain professional services transfer control at a point in time. The Company evaluates these circumstances on a case-by-case basis to determine if revenue should be recognized over time or at a point in time.

Results of Operations
2021 Compared to 2020
Consolidated sales from continuing operations were $7,010,000 in 2021, a 13% decrease from sales of $8,080,000 in 2020. Net loss from continuing operations in 2021 was $8,178,000, or ($0.85) per share compared to net loss from continuing operations of $4,707,000 or ($0.51) per share in 2020.
Services & Support Results
Services & Support sales decreased 15% to $7,483,000 in 2021 compared to $8,777,000 in 2020. Sales from the S&S segment to CSI were eliminated in consolidation and these intercompany sales are the difference between consolidated sales & S&S sales.
Revenues by customer group were as follows:
Revenues by revenue type were as follows:
Revenues from the education sector decreased $4,210,000 or 94% in 2021 due to the substantial completion of projects from the Company’s Florida school district customer in the prior year. The Company was not selected as the primary vendor on the current multi-year project for this school district, but has been selected as the secondary vendor for structured cabling and enterprise networking.
Revenue from small to medium businesses, which are primarily healthcare, financial and commercial clients, increased by 87% or $3,141,000 primarily due to the acquisition of Ecessa on May 14, 2020 and the acquisition of the assets of IVDesk on November 3, 2020. The decrease in the CSI IT operations revenue as compared to 2020 is related to the sale of CSI’s E&S business segment. Project and product revenue decreased $3,952,000 or 77% during 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the decrease in the education sector. Services and support revenue increased $2,658,000 or 73% as compared to the prior year due to the Company’s acquisition of Ecessa and its service and support revenue on its SD-WAN products as well as the acquisition of IVDesk, which contributed $2,473,000 in revenue during 2021. Overall, Ecessa contributed $2,275,000 in revenue during 2021, an increase of $1,010,000 over the prior year.
Gross profit decreased 2% to $2,907,000 in 2021 compared to $2,979,000 in 2020. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 39% in 2021 compared to 34% in 2020 due to the increase in services & support revenue, which has higher margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2021 to $2,906,000, or 39% of sales, compared to $2,464,000 in 2020, or 28% of sales due to the May 2020 acquisition of Ecessa and the November 2020 acquisition of IVDesk, and the inclusion of their associated general and administrative costs, which are not included in full in the prior year.
Services & Support reported an operating loss of $456,000 in 2021 compared to operating income of $310,000 in 2020, primarily due to decreased revenue from the education sector and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, including an increase in amortization expense of $252,000.
Other
“Other” includes non-allocated corporate overhead costs that are not considered discontinued operations. Other corporate costs increased by $1,808,000 primarily due to outside legal and financial consulting costs related to the previously announced Pineapple Energy merger.
Income Taxes
The Company’s loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $8,154,000 in 2021 compared to a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $4,693,000 in 2020. The Company recorded net income of $2,974,000, driven by the gain on the sale of the Company’s E&S segment, compared to a net loss of $172,000 for 2020. The Company’s effective income tax rate was (0.3%) in 2021 compared to (0.3%) in 2020. The 2021 effective rate differed from the standard rate of 21% primarily due to the valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, along with the impact of state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, and provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward from 2015 through 2020 activity of approximately $10,008,000 that is available to offset future taxable income and begins to expire in 2035. See Note 13 for a reconciliation of the standard tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation has not had a significant effect on operations in recent years. The Company does not have long-term production or procurement contracts and has historically been able to adjust pricing and purchasing decisions to respond to inflationary pressures.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $6,396,000 in cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, compared to $21,457,000 at December 31, 2020. Of this amount, $855,000 was invested in short-term money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or other government agency. These money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share; however, it is possible to lose money investing in these funds. The remainder in cash and cash equivalents is operating cash. The Company also had $2,904,000 in investments consisting of corporate notes and bonds that are traded on the open market and are classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2021.
The Company had working capital of $3,918,000, consisting of current assets of approximately $6,528,000 and current liabilities of $2,610,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to working capital of $28,320,000, consisting of current assets of $35,758,000 and current liabilities of $7,438,000 at the end of 2020.
Cash flow used in operating activities was approximately $4,612,000 in 2021 compared to $4,684,000 used in 2020. Significant working capital changes from 2020 to 2021 included a $2.6 million decrease in accounts receivable and $386,000 used in discontinued operations.
Cash provided by investing activities was $30,544,000 in 2021 compared to $3,930,000 used in 2020, due to $23,625,000 in proceeds from the E&S Sale Transaction, which is included in discontinued operations.
Net cash used by financing activities was $35,587,000 in 2021 compared to $800,000 in 2020. Cash dividends paid on common stock increased to $34,038,000 in 2021 ($3.50 per common share) from $564,000 in 2020 ($0.06 per common share). Proceeds from common stock issuances, principally related to the accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards, totaled approximately $3,813,000 in 2021 and $119,000 in 2020. The Company acquired $1,073,000 and $71,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, of Company stock from employees to satisfy withholding tax obligations related to share-based compensation, pursuant to terms of Board and shareholder-approved compensation plans. The Company did not acquire Company stock in 2021 under a $2,000,000 Stock Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors in August 2019. At December 31, 2021, there remained $341,000 under the 2019 Stock Repurchase Program.
In the opinion of management, based on the Company’s current financial and operating position and projected future expenditures, sufficient funds are available to meet the Company’s anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs.
If the merger is approved by CSI shareholders and the merger is consummated, the combined company will be subject to the risks set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors - “Risks Related to the Combined Company Following Consummation of the Merger.” Among these risks, the combined company needs to obtain substantial additional financing arrangements to provide working capital and growth capital and if financing is not available to it on acceptable terms when needed, its ability to continue to grow its business would be materially adversely impacted.
