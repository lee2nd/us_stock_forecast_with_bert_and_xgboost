Overview
Indoor Harvest, through its brand name Indoor Harvest®, was focused on leveraging its investment and experience in Vertical Farming, Building Integrated Agriculture, Controlled Environment Agriculture and Aeroponic Cultivation technology with other synergistic enterprises in the Cannabis industry as part of an M&A/consolidation and integration strategy.
The company spent the majority of 2021 reorganizing, restructuring, and repositioning the business.
The Company was funded through a convertible note structure from 2017 into 2019, that allowed the Company to keep being active while we restructure, reposition and recapitalize the company. We continue to seek funding from other capital sources as we position the company for future growth.
As part of the restructuring and recapitalization effort, the Company plans to regularly increases the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue. We believe this will enable the Company to raise additional capital by allowing funding sources to be able to convert debt to shares, a common form of funding, and to utilize shares as currency for future M&A transactions or related strategic initiatives.
Raising new capital is critical to the Company going forward and is a primary focus to support the acquisition and growth strategy.
Our current strategy is positioning the Company as an integration and consolidation platform offering other cannabis and hemp companies the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity, sharing intellectual capital, business networks, technology, and access to new capital markets with liquidity for investors. We will analyze cannabis and hemp companies focused on Genetics, Tissue Culture, Controlled Environment Ag technologies, including high pressure Aeroponic Cultivation, Cultivation operations, robotics and AI, Hemp, CBD and other CPG related products.
Our operational expenditures will primarily focus on review of existing assets, vetting potential M&A targets and related due diligence costs, as well as the necessary costs related to being a fully reporting company with the SEC.
On March 5, 2020, The Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Fincann Corp., a New York corporation (the “Fincann”). Fincann provides banking related strategies or solutions for the cannabis-related industry through a growing consortium of financial institutions, to help marijuana-related businesses (MRBs) to access essential banking services without complicated workarounds. Due diligence efforts are ongoing.
On February 14, 2022, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Electrum Partners, LLC (EP) to acquire certain assets of EP for an aggregate payment at closing and of a purchase price that will be mutually agreed by the parties based on an independent valuation of the purchased assets.
The Company is in the process of establishing a headquarters.
We are an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”) that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“the JOBS Act”), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming subject to the SEC’s reporting and disclosure rules. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. Because of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
