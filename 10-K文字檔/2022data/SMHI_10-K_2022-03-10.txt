Overview
The Company provides global marine and support transportation services to offshore energy facilities worldwide. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its joint ventures operated a diverse fleet of 81 support and specialty vessels, of which 60 were owned or leased-in, 20 were joint-ventured, and one was managed on behalf of unaffiliated third-parties. The primary users of the Company’s services are major integrated oil companies, large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and emerging independent companies, as well as windfarm operations and installation contractors.
The Company and its joint ventures operate and manage a diverse fleet of offshore support vessels that (i) deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations including wind farms, (ii) handle anchors and mooring equipment required to tether rigs to the seabed, and assist in placing them on location and moving them between regions, (iii) provide construction, well work-over, maintenance and decommissioning support and (iv) carry and launch equipment used underwater in drilling and well installation, maintenance, inspection and repair. Additionally, the Company’s vessels provide accommodations for technicians and specialists.
Recent Developments
OSV Partners. SEACOR OSV PARTNERS I LP., a Delaware limited partnership (“OSV Partners I”), was a joint venture that owned and operated five PSVs for which the Company acted as one of the general partners and also held a limited partnership interest in. On December 31, 2021, pursuant an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among SEACOR Marine, SEACOR Offshore OSV LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“SEACOR Offshore OSV”) and OSV Partners I, OSV Partners I merged with and into SEACOR Offshore OSV with SEACOR Offshore OSV surviving the merger (the “Merger”).
In connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,567,935 shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), as follows:
(i)
531,872 shares of Common Stock as consideration for the Merger paid to OSV Partners I’s limited partners (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), and
(ii)
1,036,063 shares of Common Stock as payment to settle all amounts and other obligations outstanding under the Subordinated PIK Loan Agreement, dated September 28, 2018 (as amended on December 22, 2021, the “PIK Loan Agreement”) and paid to the former lenders thereunder (all of whom were limited partners of OSV Partners I).
In connection with the Merger, the Company and SEACOR Offshore OSV assumed and guaranteed approximately $18.1 million of OSV Partners I’s third-party indebtedness outstanding under the amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement dated as of September 28, 2018 (as amended, restated, amended and restated or otherwise modified, the “OSV Credit Facility”), by and among OSV Partners I and lenders and other parties thereto.
As a result of the Merger, the five 201’, 1,900 tons deadweight capacity, PSVs owned by OSV Partners I are now 100% owned by the Company, bringing the Company’s owned PSV fleet to 20. Of the five PSVs previously owned by OSV Partners I, three are U.S. flagged and currently located in the Gulf of Mexico, and two are Marshall Island flagged and currently located in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2021, these five PSVs had an average age of seven years.
Trends Affecting the Offshore Marine Business
Oil and Gas Prices
The market for offshore oil and natural gas drilling has historically been cyclical. Demand for offshore support vessels is highly correlated to the price of oil and natural gas as those prices significantly impact the Company’s customers’ exploration and drilling activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices tend to fluctuate based on many factors, including global economic activity, levels of reserves and production activity. Price levels for oil and natural gas have and will continue to influence demand for offshore marine services. In addition to the price of oil and natural gas, the availability of acreage, local tax incentives or disincentives, drilling moratoriums and other regulatory actions, and requirements for maintaining interests in leases affect activity in the offshore oil and natural gas industry. Factors that influence the level of offshore exploration and drilling activities include:
•
expectations as to future oil and natural gas commodity prices;
•
customer assessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities, including newer or unconventional opportunities such as shale;
•
expectations as to the future demand for oil and natural gas in the context of the transition to non-hydrocarbon based sources of energy;
•
customer assessments of cost, geological opportunity and political stability in host countries;
•
worldwide demand for oil and natural gas;
•
the ability or willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;
•
regional conflicts in oil producing regions;
•
the level of oil and natural gas production by non-OPEC countries;
•
the relative exchange rates for the U.S. dollar; and
•
various U.S. and international government policies regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.
Offshore oil and natural gas market conditions are highly volatile. Prices deteriorated beginning in the second half of 2014 and continued to deteriorate when oil prices hit a thirteen-year low of less than $27 per barrel (on the New York Mercantile Exchange) in February 2016. Oil prices were as high as $76 per barrel in October 2018 but experienced unprecedented volatility during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effects on the global economy, including going negative for a short period of time. Oil prices have steadily increased since the lows hit at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and recently hit a multi-year high primarily as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in March of 2022 as oil prices reached $116 per barrel. While the Company has experienced difficult market conditions over the past few years due to low oil and natural gas prices and the focus of oil and natural gas producing companies on cost and capital spending budget reductions, the recent increase in oil and natural gas prices has led to an increase in utilization, day rates and customer inquiries about potential new charters.
The Company’s operations and financial results were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of decreased demand and the increase in costs due to operational changes enacted to enhance crew and on-shore employee safety. However, the Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future. We are closely monitoring updates regarding the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, the distribution of vaccines developed to combat COVID-19, emerging governmental and other vaccine mandates and testing requirements, as well as the willingness of our employees to comply with such mandates and requirements. We are adjusting our operations according to guidelines from local, state and federal officials.
Vessel Supply Dynamics and Other Industry Drivers
Low oil prices and the subsequent decline in offshore exploration have forced many operators in the industry to restructure or liquidate assets. The Company continues to closely monitor the delivery of newly built offshore support vessels to the industry-wide fleet, which in the recent past contributed to an oversaturated market, thereby further lowering the demand for the Company’s existing offshore support vessel fleet. A continuation of (i) low customer exploration and drilling activity levels, and (ii) continued excess supply of offshore support vessels whether from laid up fleets or newly built vessels could, in isolation or together, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.
Certain macro drivers somewhat independent of oil and natural gas prices may support the Company’s business, including: (i) underspending by oil and gas producers during the recent industry downturn leading to pent up demand for maintenance and growth capital expenditures; and (ii) improved extraction technologies. While we expect that alternative forms of energy will continue to grow and add to the world’s energy mix especially as governments, supranational groups and various other parties focus on climate change causes and concerns, the Company believes that for the foreseeable future demand for gasoline and oil will be sustained, as will demand for electricity from natural gas. Some alternative forms of energy such as offshore wind facilities have the potential to support, in part, the Company’s business.
The Company adheres to a strategy of cold-stacking vessels (removing from active service) during periods of weak utilization in order to reduce the daily running costs of operating the fleet, primarily personnel, repairs and maintenance costs, as well as to defer some drydocking costs into future periods. The Company considers various factors in determining which vessels to cold-stack, including upcoming dates for regulatory vessel inspections and related docking requirements. The Company may maintain class certification on certain cold-stacked vessels, thereby incurring some drydocking costs while cold-stacked. Cold-stacked vessels are returned to active service when market conditions improve, or management anticipates improvement, typically leading to increased costs for drydocking, personnel, repair and maintenance in the periods immediately preceding the vessels’ return to active service. Depending on market conditions, vessels with similar characteristics and capabilities may be rotated between active service and cold-stack. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its cold-stacked vessels to determine if any should be designated as retired and removed from service based on the vessel’s physical condition, the expected costs to reactivate and restore class certification, if any, and its viability to operate within current and projected market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, five of the Company’s 60 owned and leased-in in-service vessels were cold-stacked worldwide.
Certain Components of Revenues and Expenses
The Company operates its fleet in four principal geographic regions: the U.S., primarily in the Gulf of Mexico; Africa and Europe; the Middle East and Asia; and Latin America, primarily in Mexico, Brazil and Guyana. The Company’s vessels are highly mobile and regularly and routinely move between countries within a geographic region. In addition, the Company’s vessels are redeployed among geographic regions, subject to flag restrictions, as changes in market conditions dictate. The number and type of vessels operated, their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of the Company’s operating results and cash flows. Unless a vessel is cold-stacked, there is little reduction in daily running costs for the vessels and, consequently, operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization. The Company manages its fleet utilizing a global network of shore side support, administrative and finance personnel.
Time charter statistics are the key performance indicators for the Company’s time charter revenues. The rate per day worked is the ratio of total time charter revenues to the aggregate number of days worked. Utilization is the ratio of aggregate number of days worked to total available days for all vessels available for time charter. Unless vessels have been retired and removed from service, available days represents the total calendar days for which vessels available for time charter were owned or leased-in by the Company, whether marketed, under repair, cold-stacked or otherwise out-of-service.
Operating Revenues. The Company generates revenues by providing services to customers primarily pursuant to two different types of contractual arrangements: time charters and bareboat charters. Under a time charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel. Under a bareboat charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and all risks of operation. Vessel charters may range from several days to several years.
Direct Operating Expenses. The aggregate cost of operating the Company’s fleet depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet. The Company’s direct operating costs and expenses, other than leased-in equipment expense, are grouped into the following categories:
•
personnel (primarily wages, benefits, payroll taxes, savings plans and travel for marine personnel);
•
repairs and maintenance (primarily routine repairs and maintenance and main engine overhauls that are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs);
•
drydocking (primarily the cost of regulatory drydockings performed in accordance with applicable regulations);
•
insurance and loss reserves (primarily the cost of Hull and Machinery and Protection and Indemnity insurance premiums and loss deductibles);
•
fuel, lubes and supplies; and
•
other (communication costs, expenses incurred in mobilizing vessels between geographic regions, third-party ship management fees, freight expenses, customs and importation duties and other).
The Company expenses drydocking, engine overhaul and vessel mobilization costs as incurred. If a disproportionate number of drydockings, overhauls or mobilizations are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or quarter, operating expenses may vary significantly when compared with the prior year or prior quarter.
Direct Vessel Profit. Direct vessel profit (defined as operating revenues less operating expenses excluding leased-in equipment, “DVP”) is the Company’s measure of segment profitability. DVP is a critical financial measure used by the Company to analyze and compare the operating performance of its regions, without regard to financing decisions (depreciation and interest expense for owned vessels vs. lease expense for leased-in vessels).
Leased-in Equipment. In addition to the Company’s owned fleet, it operates leased-in vessels from lessors under bareboat charter arrangements that currently expire in 2023. Certain of these vessels were previously owned and subject of sale and leaseback transactions with their lessors.
Impairments. As a result of the difficult conditions experienced in the offshore oil and natural gas markets beginning in the second half of 2014 and the corresponding reductions in utilization and rates per day worked of its fleet, the Company identified indicators of impairment and has over the past few years recognized impairment charges primarily associated with its AHTS fleet, its liftboat fleet, certain specialty vessels and vessels removed from service. When reviewing its fleet for impairment, the Company groups vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics, including cold-stacked vessels expected to return to active service, into vessel classes. All other vessels, including vessels retired and removed from service, are evaluated for impairment on a vessel by vessel basis.
During 2021, the Company recorded no impairment charges associated with its fleet. During 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13.5 million associated with its liftboat fleet (five owned and two leased-in vessels), and one specialty vessel and recognized net losses of $5.3 million as a result of asset disposals ($4.8 million loss due to the disposal of one vessel under construction, and $0.5 million loss due to the redelivery of one leased-in AHTS vessel and one leased-in liftboat). During 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $12.0 million primarily associated with its AHTS fleet (four owned and one leased-in vessel), four FSVs and one leased-in specialty vessel. Estimated fair values for the Company’s owned vessels were established by independent appraisers and other market data such as recent sales of similar vessels. For information regarding the Company’s vessel fair value measurement determinations, see “Note 11. Fair Value Measurements” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If market conditions continue to decline from the presently depressed utilization and rates per day worked experienced over the last three years, fair values based on future appraisals could decline significantly.
The Company’s other vessel classes and other individual vessels in active service and cold-stacked status, for which no impairment was deemed necessary, have generally experienced a less severe decline in utilization and rates per day worked based on specific market factors. The market factors include vessels with more general utility to a broader range of customers (e.g., FSVs), vessels required for customers to meet regulatory mandates and operating under multiple year contracts or vessels that service customers outside of the offshore oil and natural gas market.
For vessel classes and individual vessels with indicators of impairment, but which were not impaired as of December 31, 2021, the Company has estimated that their future undiscounted cash flows exceed their current carrying values by more than 40%. The Company’s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective as utilization and rates per day worked are uncertain, including the timing of an estimated market recovery in the offshore oil and natural gas markets and the timing and cost of reactivating cold-stacked vessels. If market conditions decline further, or remain stagnant at current levels, changes in the Company’s expectations on future cash flows may result in recognizing additional impairment charges related to its long-lived assets in future periods.

Leased-in expenses were $8.3 million lower for 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to the impairment of three leased-in vessels and one leased-in vessel having been returned to the lessor in the first quarter of 2020.
Administrative and general. Administrative and general expenses were $2.4 million lower in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to a $3.0 million transaction fee paid in 2020 to SEACOR Holdings under the Tax Refund and Indemnification Agreement entered into by the Company and SEACOR Holdings on June 26, 2020 (the “Tax Refund Agreement”).
Administrative and general expenses were $0.3 million higher in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to a transaction fee paid to SEACOR Holdings under the Tax Refund Agreement, offset by decreases in employee and director compensation expenses.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $0.2 million higher in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to net fleet change. Depreciation and amortization expenses were flat when comparing 2020 with 2019.
Gains (Losses) on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2021, the Company recorded no impairment charges associated with its fleet. The Company sold one PSV vessel, three FSVs and set off debt payments with hull and machinery insurance proceeds received in respect of the SEACOR Power of $25.0 million, for a total of $30.1 million in cash, resulting in gains of $20.9 million all of which was recognized currently. The insurance proceeds from the SEACOR Power were primarily used to repay associated debt under the FGUSA Credit Facility as defined and described in “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13.5 million associated with its liftboat fleet (five owned and two leased-in vessels), one specialty vessel and recognized net losses of $5.3 million ($4.8 million loss due to the disposal of one vessel under construction, and $0.5 million loss due to the redelivery of one leased-in AHTS vessel and one leased-in liftboat). The Company sold two AHTS vessels and one specialty vessel previously removed from service, four FSVs, one specialty, one vessel under construction and other equipment for $21.6 million and gains of $1.2 million.
During 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $12.0 million associated with its AHTS fleet (four owned and one leased vessel), four FSVs and one leased-in supply vessel. The Company sold one AHTS vessel, seven FSVs, five supply vessels and three liftboats. In addition, the Company sold five AHTS vessels and one specialty vessel previously retired and removed from service and other equipment for aggregate net proceeds of $55.3 million and gains of $5.5 million.
Other (Expense) Income, Net
For the years ended December 31, the Company’s other income (expense) was as follows (in thousands):
Interest Income. Interest income in 2021 increased primarily due to a tax refund on a portion of interest paid. Interest income in 2020 was lower due to decreases in interest income from the Company’s construction reserve funds deposits which were substantially lower offset by increased income due to interest earned on loans and advances to Joint Ventures.
Interest expense. Interest expense was lower in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the repayment of the FGUSA Credit Facility in June 2021 and lower interest rates on floating rate debt. This decrease was offset by increases in interest associated with the SEACOR Alpine Shipyard Financing following delivery of one PSV in 2020 and increases in interest associated with the Tarahumara Shipyard Financing following delivery of one PSV in 2021, as described in “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest expense was higher in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the debt acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisition 100% of SEACOR Offshore Delta (f/k/a SEACOSCO), and partially offset due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and payments of principal on outstanding debt.
SEACOR Holdings guarantee fees. As of December 31, 2021, SEACOR Holdings had no outstanding guarantees in respect of certain of the Company’s obligations. See “Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.”
Gain on debt extinguishment. On June 10, 2021, SEACOR Marine, Falcon Global USA LLC, an indirect subsidiary of SEACOR Marine (“FGUSA”), and certain subsidiaries of FGUSA, entered into the Conditional Payoff Agreement in respect of the (i) FGUSA Credit Facility and (ii) FGUSA Obligation Guaranty. (See “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information).
Derivative gains, net. Net derivative gains in 2021 compared to 2020 was lower due to the fair value of the conversion option liability associated with the Convertible Senior Notes decreasing from $5.2 million to zero in 2020 offset by gains realized on foreign currency forwards in 2021. For all periods, derivative gains were primarily due to reductions in the fair value of the Company’s conversion option liability embedded in the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes. The reductions in the conversion option liability were primarily the result of declines in the Company’s share price and estimated credit spread.
Foreign currency losses, net. Foreign currency losses in 2021 were lower primarily due to various changes in foreign currencies.
Gain from return of investments in 50% or less owned companies and other, net. Other gains during 2021 were primarily due to a distribution of $12.0 million from the Company’s MEXMAR Offshore joint venture of which $9.4 million was in excess of the Company’s investment in the joint venture.
Income Tax Benefit
For the year ending December 31, 2021, the Company’s effective income tax rate of 173.4% was primarily due to foreign taxes paid that are not creditable against U.S. income taxes and foreign subsidiaries with current losses for which there is no current or future federal income tax benefit available.
For the year ending December 31, 2020, the Company’s effective income tax rate of 23.4% was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized as a result of the CARES Act signed into law in March 2020, as well as taxes provided on income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign sourced income not subject to U.S. income taxes, foreign taxes not creditable against U.S. income taxes, and the adjustment for the acquisition of the remaining minority membership interest in Falcon Global Holdings.
For the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company’s effective income tax rate of 9.4% was lower than the Company’s statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to foreign subsidiaries with current losses for which there is no current or future federal income tax benefit.
Equity in (Losses) Earnings of 50% or Less Owned Companies, Net of Tax
For the years ended December 31, the Company’s equity in earnings (losses) from continuing operations of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, was as follows (in thousands):
2021 compared with 2020
MexMar. Equity earnings from MexMar was higher by $14.5 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a provision for doubtful accounts recorded in 2020 related to a default of a loan provided by MexMar to UP Offshore (Bahamas) Ltd (“UP Offshore”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MEXMAR Offshore (which is a separate joint venture of the Company).
MEXMAR Offshore. On June 1, 2021, MEXMAR Offshore International LLC (“MEXMAR Offshore”), a joint venture 49% owned by an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SEACOR Marine, and 51% owned by a subsidiary of Proyectos Globales de Energía y Servicios CME, S.A. de C.V. (“CME”), UP Offshore (Bahamas) Ltd. (“UP Offshore”), a provider of offshore support vessel services to the energy industry in Brazil and a wholly owned subsidiary of MEXMAR Offshore, and certain of subsidiaries of UP Offshore, completed the sale of eight vessels and certain Brazilian entities to Oceanpact Servicos Maritimos S.A. and its subsidiary, OceanPact Netherlands B.V., for a total purchase price of $30.2 million (the “UP Offshore Sale Transaction”). The UP Offshore Sale Transaction resulted in an equity earnings gain from 50% or less owned companies of $2.6 million.
On July 23, 2021, the Company received a distribution from its MEXMAR Offshore joint venture in the amount of $12.0 million of which $9.4 million was in excess of the Company’s investment balance of $2.6 million. The excess was recorded by the Company as a gain from return of investments in 50% or less owned companies. After giving effect to the UP Offshore Sale Transaction, MEXMAR Offshore, indirectly through certain subsidiaries of UP Offshore, retained ownership of three vessels. As part of the winddown of the MEXMAR Offshore joint venture, ownership of two of these vessels was transferred from subsidiaries of UP Offshore to OVH on October 26, 2021, and the remaining vessel was transferred from a subsidiary of UP Offshore to OVH on November 2, 2021. Upon completion of these transactions, MEXMAR Offshore no longer held income producing assets and as a result, on December 9, 2021, the Company transferred its 49% interest in MEXMAR Offshore to a subsidiary of CME for nominal consideration and a transaction fee of $0.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company does not have any ownership interest in MEXMAR Offshore.
Offshore Vessel Holdings (“OVH”). Equity earnings increased by $4.9 million due to dividends received from OVH and lower maintenance and repair costs and depreciation and amortization expenses. As a result of equity losses in 2020, the Company had reduced its investment balance in OVH to zero in 2020.
OSV Partners. Equity losses from SEACOR OSV Partners GP LLC (“OSV Partners GP”) and SEACOR OSV Partners I LP LLC (“OSV Partners I, and collectively with OSV Partners GP, “OSV Partners”) decreased by $0.2 million, primarily due to higher utilization and an increase in the overall day rate. On December 31, 2021, OSV Partners I merged with and into SEACOR Offshore OSV with SEACOR Offshore OSV surviving the merger (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the five 201’, 1,900 tons deadweight capacity, PSVs owned by OSV Partners I are now 100% owned by the Company.
SEACOR Arabia. The decrease of $2.3 million in equity gains from SEACOR Marine Arabia was due to reduced revenues and higher operating costs.
2020 compared with 2019
MexMar. Equity earnings from MexMar decreased by $5.1 million as compared to 2019 due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts due to a default on a loan agreement with UP Offshore (Bahamas) Ltd (“UP Offshore”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MEXMAR Offshore.
MEXMAR Offshore. Equity losses from MEXMAR Offshore increased by $4.9 million due to losses in the value of the investment.
Offshore Vessel Holdings (“OVH”). Equity losses increased by $3.2 million due to higher maintenance and repair costs, depreciation and amortization primarily due to the addition of vessels operated under financial leases and increasing financial and other expenses.
OSV Partners Equity losses from SEACOR OSV Partners GP LLC (“OSV Partners GP”) and SEACOR OSV Partners I LP LLC (“OSV Partners I, and collectively with OSV Partners GP, “OSV Partners”) increased by less than $0.1 million, primarily due to utilization.
SEACOR Grant DIS. Change in equity earnings from SEACOR Grant DIS LLC (“SEACOR Grant DIS”) was due to the joint venture dissolution in 2019.
Dynamic Offshore Drilling. The investment in Dynamic Offshore Drilling Limited (“Dynamic Offshore Drilling”) was fully impaired in 2019.
SEACOR Offshore Delta (f/k/a SEACOSCO). The decrease of $5.4 million in equity losses from SEACOR Offshore Delta LLC (“SEACOR Offshore Delta”) was primarily due to the acquisition of and consolidation of the joint venture in July 2020.
SEACOR Arabia. The increase of $2.3 million in equity gains from SEACOR Marine Arabia was due to increased revenues and recording of a true-up of fees related to the management agreement with our joint venture partner of $0.9 million recognized in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
The Company’s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from working capital needs, capital commitments and its obligations to service outstanding debt and comply with covenants under its debt facilities. The Company may use its liquidity to fund capital expenditures, make acquisitions or to make other investments. Sources of liquidity are cash balances, construction reserve funds and cash flows from operations. From time to time, the Company may secure additional liquidity through asset sales or the issuance of debt, shares of Common Stock or common stock of its subsidiaries, preferred stock or a combination thereof.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had unfunded capital commitments of $0.9 million for miscellaneous vessel equipment payable during 2022. The Company has indefinitely deferred an additional $9.4 million of orders with respect to one FSV that the Company had previously reported as unfunded capital commitments.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding debt of $364.4 million, net of debt discount and issue costs. The Company’s contractual long-term debt maturities as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (in thousands):
As of December 31, 2021, the Company held balances of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and construction reserve funds totaling $41.2 million compared to $36.0 million as of December 31, 2020. There was no balance in construction reserve funds as of December 31, 2021 and $4.2 million of construction reserve funds held as cash as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Company had $1.2 million available borrowing capacity under subsidiary credit facilities as of December 31, 2021. In January 2021, the Company received cash proceeds of $42.6 million for the sale of Windcat Workboats. In addition, as a result of the CARES Act and the entry into the Tax Refund Agreement, the Company received cash tax refunds of approximately $32.3 million (including $1.1 million of interest paid by the IRS in respect of refund payment delays due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic) in 2020 and 2021. These tax refunds are subject to the terms of the Tax Refund Agreement, which does not restrict the use of approximately $23.1 million of the refund, with the remaining $8.1 million required to be deposited into an account to be used to satisfy certain of the Company’s obligations that remain guaranteed by SEACOR Holdings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has applied all of the amount deposited to satisfy these obligations in full.
For the years ended December 31, the following is a summary of the Company’s cash flows (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $38.7 million in 2021 compared with 2020. The biggest driver of the increase in cash flows provided by operations was the receipt of tax refunds under the CARES Act as described above and in “Note 9. Income Taxes” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For the years ended December 31, the components of cash flows provided by (used in) continuing operating activities were as follows (in thousands):
(1)
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, capitalized interest paid and included in purchases of property and equipment for continuing operations was $0.3 million, $0.9 million, and $1.5 million, respectively.
For a detailed discussion of the Company’s financial results for the reported periods, see “Consolidated Results of Operations” included above. Changes in operating assets and liabilities before interest and income taxes are the result of the Company’s working capital requirements.

•
the Company purchased subsidiary shares from holders of noncontrolling interests for $3.4 million; and
•
the Company received $1.4 million from the exercise of stock options.
Short and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements and Outlook
The Company believes that a combination of cash balances on hand, construction reserve funds, cash generated from operating activities, availability under existing subsidiary financing arrangements and access to the credit and capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, including to support its capital expenditures program, working capital needs, debt service requirements and covenant compliance over the short to medium term. The Company continually evaluates possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. The Company’s sources of liquidity may be impacted by the general condition of the markets in which it operates and the broader economy as a whole, which may limit its access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. Management will continue to closely monitor the Company’s liquidity and compliance with covenants in its credit facilities specifically as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Company's primary credit facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum of $35.0 million of cash on hand (including restricted cash) at all times. As of December 31, 2021 the Company's cash balances used to test compliance with this covenant was $41.2 million. The Company believes that its currently available cash as well as cash from future operations and other sources such as asset sales and capital markets activity will be sufficient to maintain compliance with this covenant for the foreseeable future.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the demand for the Company’s products and services, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company’s liquidity or on the Company’s ability to meet its financial maintenance covenants in its various credit facilities. However, if the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business becomes more severe, for example by further reducing demand for the Company’s products and services or causing customers not to make their payments on time, the Company may be required to seek amendments to the covenant to avoid a default under the facility.
Future Cash Requirements
The Company’s primary future cash requirements will be to fund operations, debt service, capital expenditures, employee retirement benefit plans, and lease payment obligations. In addition, the Company may use cash in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments. Specifically, the Company expects its primary cash requirements for fiscal year 2022 to be as follows:
•
Debt service - We expect to make principal and interest payments of approximately $48.5 million during fiscal year 2022 under our currently outstanding debt facilities.
•
Capital expenditures - At this time, we do not expect to make any capital expenditures during fiscal year 2022 although if market dynamics change substantially or an appropriate opportunity arises we may determine to make such expenditures at that time.
•
Employee retirement benefit plans - We estimate we will make payments under our retirement benefit plans of approximately $0.8 million during fiscal year 2022.
•
Lease payments - We expect to make lease payments of approximately $2.3 million for our operating and finance leases during fiscal year 2022 under our currently effective leases.
In addition to the matters identified above, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in litigation, claims, government inquiries, investigations and proceedings relating to commercial, employment, environmental and regulatory matters. An unfavorable resolution in this or other matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future cash requirements.
Debt Securities and Credit Agreements
For a discussion of the Company’s debt securities and credit agreements, see “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Effects of Inflation
The Company’s operations expose it to the effects of inflation. In the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy, inflationary pressures could result in increased operating and financing costs. For example, the pressures of inflation have increased our costs of labor and may continue to do so.
Contingencies
MNOPF and MNRPF. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are participating employers in two industry-wide, multi-employer, defined benefit pension funds in the U.K.: the MNOPF and the MNRPF.
The Company’s participation in the MNOPF began with the acquisition of the Stirling group of companies (the “Stirling Group”) in 2001 and relates to certain officers employed between 1978 and 2002 by the Stirling Group and/or its predecessors. The Company’s participation in the MNRPF also began with the acquisition of the Stirling Group in 2001 and relates to ratings employed by the Stirling Group and/or its predecessors through today. Both of these plans are in deficit positions and, depending upon the results of future actuarial valuations, it is possible that the plans could experience funding deficits that will require the Company to recognize payroll related operating expenses in the periods invoices are received. As of December 31, 2021, all invoices related to MNOPF and MNRPF have been settled in full.
On October 19, 2021, the Company was informed by the MNRPF that two issues had been identified during a review of the MNRPF by the applicable trustee that would potentially give rise to material additional liabilities for the MNRPF. The MNRPF has indicated that the investigations into these issues remain ongoing, and that further updates will be provided as significant developments arise. Should such additional liabilities require the MNRPF to collect additional funds from participating employers, it is possible that the Company will be invoiced for a portion of such funds and recognize payroll related operating expenses in the periods invoices are received.
SEACOR Power. On April 13, 2021, the SEACOR Power, a liftboat owned by a subsidiary of the Company with nineteen individuals on board, capsized off the coast of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. The incident resulted in the death of several crew members, including the captain of the vessel and five other employees of the Company. The incident also resulted in the constructive total loss of the SEACOR Power. The Company is responsible for the salvage operations related to the vessel and is coordinating these efforts with the USCG. The salvage operations are currently ongoing and the Company expects salvage costs to be covered by insurance proceeds.
The capsizing of the SEACOR Power garnered significant attention from the media as well as local, state and federal politicians. The NTSB and the USCG are currently investigating the incident to determine the cause of the incident and the Company is fully cooperating with the investigations in all respects and continues to gather information about the incident. It is expected that the NTSB and USCG investigations will take a significant period of time to complete, possibly as much as two years or longer. Numerous civil lawsuits have been filed against the Company and other third parties by the family members of deceased crew members and the surviving crew members employed by the Company or by the third parties. On June 2, 2021, the Company filed a Limitation of Liability Act complaint in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana (“Limitation Action”), which has the effect of enjoining all existing civil lawsuits and requiring the plaintiffs to file their claims relating to the capsizing of the SEACOR Power in the Limitation Action. There is significant uncertainty in the amount and timing of costs and potential liabilities relating to the incident involving the SEACOR Power, the impact the incident will have on the Company’s reputation and the resulting possible impact on the Company’s business.
Other. In the normal course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various other litigation matters including, among others, claims by third-parties for alleged property damages and personal injuries. Management has used estimates in determining the Company’s potential exposure to these matters and has recorded reserves in its financial statements related thereto where appropriate. It is possible that a change in the Company’s estimates of that exposure could occur, but the Company does not expect such changes in estimated costs would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Related Party Transactions
For a discussion of the Company’s transactions with related parties, see “Note 17. Related Party Transactions” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SEACOR Marine and its controlled subsidiaries. Control is generally deemed to exist if the Company has greater than 50% of the voting rights of a subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in the combination and consolidation.
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity. The Company reports consolidated net income (loss) inclusive of both the Company’s and the noncontrolling interests' share, as well as the amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to each of the Company and the noncontrolling interests. If a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former controlled subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income (loss) based on such fair value. If a subsidiary is consolidated upon the acquisition of controlling interests by the Company, any previous noncontrolled equity investment in the subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income (loss) based on such fair value.
The Company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in 50% or less owned companies that it does not control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the business venture. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of a business venture but may exist when the Company’s ownership percentage is less than 20%. In certain circumstances, the Company may have an economic interest in excess of 50% but may not control and consolidate the business venture. Conversely, the Company may have an economic interest less than 50% but may control and consolidate the business venture. The Company reports its investments in and advances to these business ventures in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments, at equity, and advances to 50% or less owned companies. The Company reports its share of earnings from investments in 50% or less owned companies in the accompanying consolidated statements of net income (loss) as equity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include those related to deferred revenues, allowance for credit loss accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, impairments, income tax provisions and certain accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from estimates and those differences may be material.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services to its customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers over control of the promised goods or services to its customers. The Company recognizes revenue net of sales taxes based on its estimates of the consideration the Company expects to receive. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are expensed as incurred.
The Company’s lease revenues are primarily from time charters and bareboat charters that are recognized ratably over the lease term as services are provided, typically on a per day basis. Under a time charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer for a set term and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel. Under a bareboat charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer for a set term and the customer assumes responsibility.
The Company also contracts with various customers to carry out management services for vessels as agents for and on behalf of ship owners. These services include crew management, technical management, commercial management, insurance arrangements, sale and purchase of vessels, provisions and bunkering. As the manager of the vessels, the Company undertakes to use its best efforts to provide the agreed management services as agents for and on behalf of the owners in accordance with sound ship management practice and to protect and promote the interest of the owners in all matters relating to the provision of services thereunder. The Company also contracts with various customers to carry out management services regarding engineering for vessel construction and vessel conversions. The vast majority of the ship management agreements span one to three years and are typically billed on a monthly basis. The Company transfers control of the service to the customer and satisfies its performance obligation over the term of the contract, and therefore recognizes revenue over the term of the contract while related costs are expensed as incurred.
Concentrations of Credit Risk. The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk associated with its cash and cash equivalents, construction reserve funds and derivative instruments. The Company minimizes its credit risk relating to these positions by monitoring the financial condition of the financial institutions and counterparties involved and by primarily conducting business with large, well-established financial institutions and diversifying its counterparties. The Company does not currently anticipate nonperformance by any of its significant counterparties. The Company is also exposed to concentrations of credit risk relating to its receivables due from customers described above. The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support its outstanding receivables. The Company minimizes its credit risk relating to receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, to date, credit losses have not been material.
Trade and Other Receivables. Customers are primarily major integrated national and international oil companies and large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Customers are granted credit on a short-term basis and the related credit risks are minimal. Other receivables consist primarily of operating expenses the Company incurs in relation to vessels it manages for other entities, as well as insurance and income tax receivables. The Company routinely reviews its receivables and makes provisions for the credit losses utilizing the Current Expected Credit Losses model (“CECL”). The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. However, those provisions are estimates and actual results may materially differ from those estimates. Trade receivables are deemed uncollectible and are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for credit losses when collection efforts have been exhausted.
Property and Equipment. Equipment, stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated salvage value. With respect to each class of asset, the estimated useful life is based upon a newly built asset being placed into service and represents the time period beyond which it is typically not justifiable for the Company to continue to operate the asset in the same or similar manner. From time to time, the Company may acquire older assets that have already exceeded the Company’s useful life policy, in which case the Company depreciates such assets based on its best estimate of remaining useful life, typically the next survey or certification date. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated useful life (in years) of the Company’s new Offshore Support Vessels was 20 years.
Equipment maintenance and repair costs and the costs of routine overhauls, drydockings and inspections performed on vessels and equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred. Expenditures that extend the useful life or improve the marketing and commercial characteristics of equipment as well as major renewals and improvements to other properties are capitalized.
Certain interest costs incurred during the construction of equipment are capitalized as part of the assets’ carrying values and are amortized over such assets’ estimated useful lives.
Business Combinations. For acquisitions constituting a business acquisition, the Company recognizes 100% of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Shares issued in consideration for a business combination, contingent consideration arrangements and pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies are all measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes to fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are generally reflected in earnings. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred and any changes in an acquirer’s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals are recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense. The operating results of entities acquired are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss) from the date of acquisition. If an acquisition of an asset or group of assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. The assets are measured based on their cost to the Company, including transaction costs. The acquisition cost is then allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values.
Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been provided in recognition of the income tax effect attributable to the book and tax basis differences of assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are provided using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which they are expected to be settled or realized. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions are recognized in interest expense and administrative and general, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) regime effectively imposes a minimum tax on worldwide foreign earnings and subjects U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”) to current taxation on certain income earned through a CFC. The Company has made the policy election to record any liability associated with GILTI in the period in which it is incurred.
Prior to 2017, SEACOR Marine was included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of SEACOR Holdings. SEACOR Holdings’ policy for allocation of U.S. federal income taxes required its domestic subsidiaries included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return to compute their provision for U.S. federal income taxes on a separate company basis and settle with SEACOR Holdings.
In the normal course of business, the Company or SEACOR Holdings may be subject to challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due for the Company. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions. As part of the calculation of income tax expense, the Company determines whether the benefits of its tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained, the Company accrues the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of its tax benefits and actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Derivative Instruments. The Company accounts for derivatives through the use of a fair value concept whereby all of the Company’s derivative positions are stated at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as derivative gains (losses), net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized as corresponding increases or decreases in the fair value of the underlying hedged item to the extent they are effective, with any ineffective portion reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as derivative gains (losses), net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss to the extent they are effective and reclassified into earnings on the same line item associated with the hedged transaction and in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as derivative gains (losses), net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are entered into by the Company’s 50% or less owned companies are also reported as a component of the Company’s other comprehensive loss in proportion to the Company’s ownership percentage, with reclassifications and ineffective portions being included in equity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company performs an impairment analysis of long-lived assets used in operations, including intangible assets, when indicators of impairment are present. These indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If the carrying values of the assets are not recoverable, as determined by their estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the estimated fair value of the assets or asset groups are compared to their current carrying values and impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value exceeds fair value. However, the Company’s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective as utilization and rates per day worked are uncertain, especially in light of the continued volatility in commodity prices and the effect COVID-19 has had on the timing of an estimated market recovery in the offshore oil and natural gas markets and upon any such recovery, the timing and cost of reactivating cold-stacked vessels. If market conditions decline further, changes in the Company’s expectations on future cash flows may result in recognizing additional impairment charges related to its long-lived assets in future periods.
Impairment of 50% or Less Owned Companies. Investments in 50% or less owned companies are reviewed periodically to assess whether there is an other-than-temporary decline in the carrying value of the investment. In its evaluation, the Company considers, among other items, recent and expected financial performance and returns, impairments recorded by the investee and the capital structure of the investee. When the Company determines the estimated fair value of an investment is below carrying value and the decline is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Actual results may vary from the Company’s estimates due to the uncertainty regarding projected financial performance, the severity and expected duration of declines in value, and the available liquidity in the capital markets to support the continuing operations of the investee, among other factors. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, the investee’s actual performance compared with the estimates could produce different results and lead to additional impairment charges in future periods.
