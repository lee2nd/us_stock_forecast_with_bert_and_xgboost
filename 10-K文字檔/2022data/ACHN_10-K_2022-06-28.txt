Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our results of operations and cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, and financial conditions as of March 31, 2022, and 2021 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Overview
Achison Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on December 29, 2014.
On July 1, 2019, Lansdale Inc, the principal stockholder of the Company (“Seller”) and controlled by the Company’s prior President, Mr. Wanjun Xie, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Dazhong 368 Inc, (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which, a total of 9,000,000 shares of Class A common stock of the Company were transferred to the Buyer, representing approximately 90% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, resulting in a change of the control of the Company. Mr. Dingshan Zhang was appointed as the President and CEO of the Company at the same date.
Prior to the change of the management team, the Company was engaging in holding or trading securities in the US market, trading spot silver in Singapore’s market as well as to trade whisky in the UK market. The Company has changed its focus to operate online advertising business through www.dazhong368.com (the “Website”) in the New York area.
The Website was established by Mr. Zhang in 2014 which is mainly focused on customers in the Greater New York area. The Website advertises different markets for professional individuals or companies including real estate, services, accounting, legal and so forth. We charge certain fees from these advertisements posted on our Website. The Company expects to generate revenue from the online advertising business and we also seek other profitable business at the same time.
Results of Operation for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated revenue in the amount of $7,400 and $3,800, respectively. The increase was mainly due to our online advertising business formally launched in the second half of year 2020. During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred operating expenses of $51,310 and $75,939, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in professional fees. For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, our net loss was $43,436 and $66,512, respectively. The decrease in net loss was mainly due to the decrease in operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2022, compared to 2021, partially offset by the increase in revenue.
Equity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $239,702. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash of $14,269 and negative working capital of $50,331, compared to cash of $17,496 and a negative working capital of $6,041 on March 31, 2021. The decrease in the working capital was primarily due to cash used to pay for operating expenses.
Going Concern Assessment
The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated deficit and other adverse key financial ratios.
Management’s plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations and execute the business plan of the Company in order to meet its operating needs on a timely basis. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund the Company’s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions included in footnote 2 of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.
