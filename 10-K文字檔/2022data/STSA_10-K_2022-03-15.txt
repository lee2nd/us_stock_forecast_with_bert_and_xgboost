ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled “Selected Financial Data” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our intentions, plans, objectives, expectations, forecasts and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic product for the acute treatment of migraine. Our product candidate, STS101, is a drug-device combination of a proprietary dry-powder formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate, or DHE, which is designed to be quickly and easily self-administered with a proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device. DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine and have significant advantages over other therapeutics for many patients. However, broad use has been limited by invasive and burdensome administration and/or sub-optimal clinical performance of available injectable and liquid nasal spray products. STS101 is specifically designed to deliver the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming these shortcomings. If approved, we believe STS101 has the potential to be an important and differentiated option for the acute treatment of migraine that can address the unmet needs of many people living with migraines.
In September 2020, we announced topline data from the EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial, or EMERGE trial, which randomized 1,201 migraine subjects to one of two STS101 dose strengths or placebo. Although STS101 3.9 mg and 5.2 mg showed favorable numerical differences versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at two hours post-administration, these differences did not achieve statistical significance for either dose strength. Both dose strengths of STS101 did, however, demonstrate significant effects on both freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom by three hours post-dose and later time points. Both STS101 dose strengths were well-tolerated in the EMERGE trial, with low adverse event rates and no serious adverse events reported.
In March 2021, we announced an update to our development plan for STS101 that takes into account the findings from our analyses of results from our EMERGE efficacy trial and results from our ongoing ASCEND open-label, Phase 3 long-term safety trial of STS101 5.2 mg, or ASCEND trial. Our updated development plan for STS101 included a Phase 1 trial, which we completed in June 2021, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of STS101 5.2 mg and two higher dose strengths, as well as a new pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial, or SUMMIT trial, of STS101 5.2 mg that we initiated in June 2021, with topline results expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. If successful, we plan to file an NDA for STS101 in the first quarter of 2023.
Our net losses were $51.2 million and $47.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $141.7 million.
As we continue the development of STS101, our expenses will increase substantially over recent periods, as we advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing scale-up and seek to obtain regulatory approval, and prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved.
Since our inception in June 2016, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine. We have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and as we prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. In addition, we expect to continue to incur increasing costs associated with operating as a public company.
In October 2020, we entered into a sales agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with SVB Leerink LLC (“SVB”) to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through an at-the-market equity offering program under which SVB will act as its sales agent and pursuant to which we may sell common stock for aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million. The issuance and sale of shares of common stock by us pursuant to the Sales Agreement is deemed an “at-the-market” offering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. SVB is entitled to compensation for its services equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold through SVB under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had not received any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement.
In February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to certain purchasers an aggregate of 14,084,507 shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of $5.68, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 26, 2021, for gross proceeds of $80.0 million (“Private Placement”). We closed the Private Placement in March 2021 and received $75.2 million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and offering expenses.
We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product revenue since our inception. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of STS101. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of STS101, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of STS101.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $95.8 million. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that those cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and into the second half of 2023.
COVID-19
COVID-19 has placed strains on the providers of healthcare services, including the healthcare clinics and institutions where we conduct our ongoing clinical trials and may conduct planned clinical trials. To date, we have initiated and enrolled subjects in our planned STS101 clinical trials in accordance with our previously communicated timeline objectives. We will continue to follow FDA guidance on clinical trial conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to remote monitoring of clinical data. To date, subjects in our clinical trials have generally been able to complete their scheduled visits or treatments and we have been able to collect the essential data from those visits or treatments, as well as from the internet-connected electronic diary devices, as applicable, subjects in our trials may use to record efficacy and other key data.
To date, we have not experienced any disruption in our supply of investigational product necessary to conduct our clinical trials and, given our investigational product inventories, believe we will be able to supply the needs of our clinical trials. We are supporting our employees by utilizing remote work when necessary and appropriate, leveraging virtual meeting technology and encouraging employees to follow local guidelines.
The following summarizes our priorities and actions to address the COVID-19 disruption and its impact on our operations:
Health & Safety
•
The health and well-being of our employees, subjects in our clinical trials, and staff at our clinical trial sites and supply chain partners is our top priority.
•
We have implemented strict measures to ensure and maintain safety, including working remotely when necessary and appropriate, social distancing and enhanced protocols to allow, if deemed necessary, remote monitoring and in-home testing of the subjects participating in our clinical trials.
•
We are closely monitoring rapidly evolving conditions throughout the United States and the rest of the world and are adhering to local, state and federal guidelines.
Business Continuity
•
In August 2020, we initiated subject enrollment in our ASCEND safety trial of STS101. While we expect our ASCEND safety trial to benefit from some of the similar design features that enabled our EMERGE efficacy trial to be completed on schedule, there can be no assurance that clinical site initiation and enrollment will not be delayed or otherwise negatively affected. Similarly, there can be no assurance that our recently initiated SUMMIT efficacy trial of STS101 will not be delayed or otherwise negatively affected as a result of the ongoing pandemic.
•
We are working closely with our supply chain partners globally to maintain the levels of investigational product and proprietary nasal delivery devices to conduct existing and planned clinical trials, as suppliers support the health and safety of their employees.
Components of Operating Results
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
All of our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine. These expenses include:
•
payroll and personnel-related expenses, including salaries, annual cash bonuses, employee benefit costs and stock-based compensation expenses for our research and product development employees;
•
fees paid to third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical studies and other research and development activities, including contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, consultants, and other service providers; and
•
costs for licenses and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment, depreciation, information technology costs and utilities.
We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We have entered into various agreements with third party vendors and CMOs. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events or tasks, and contracted costs. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to CROs and CMOs under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets until the services are rendered. Nonrefundable payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. The capitalized amounts are recognized as expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
As we continue the development of STS101, our research and development expenses will increase substantially over recent periods, as we seek to advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved. Predicting the timing or the cost to complete our clinical trials or validation of our commercial manufacturing and supply processes is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors, including factors outside of our control. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials or if we experience delays in manufacturing with any of our CMOs, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Furthermore, we are unable to predict with any certainty when or if STS101 will receive regulatory approval.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist principally of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and tax services, directors and officers insurance, allocated overhead, including rent, debt service, equipment, depreciation, information technology costs, and utilities, and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses including expenses associated with pre-commercialization activities.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements, expenses associated with pre-commercialization activities, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to our long-term debt and accretion of debt discount and debt issuance costs.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 4%, from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was in research and development expenses was primarily due to increase of $1.2 million in clinical trial costs, which was the net of an increase of $11.3 million for the SUMMIT efficacy trial, $3.0 million for the ASCEND safety trial, and $1.3 million for the STS101 Phase 1 trials offset by decrease of $14.1 million in EMERGE efficacy trial costs as the EMERGE trial and related costs concluded in December 2020, and a $0.3 million decrease in clinical consultant costs, as well as increases of $1.2 million in payroll and personnel expenses, and $0.2 million in other expenses, partly offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in manufacturing activities.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 12%, from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, and an increase of $1.1 million for directors and officers liability insurance, board fees
including stock based compensation, other services partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in legal and outside consultants.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased by $1.0 million, or 86%, from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021, which was the net result of the significantly lower interest yields on slightly lower average balances for our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $0.2 million, or 53%, from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily attributable to the decrease of outstanding debt balances.
Liquidity and Capital Resources; Plan of Operations
Sources of Liquidity
We have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock in our IPO, and private placements of equity securities and borrowings under its long-term debt facility. We have no products approved for sale, and we have not generated any revenue since inception. We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years.
In October 2020, we entered into the Sales Agreement with SVB to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through an at-the-market equity offering program under which SVB will act as its sales agent and pursuant to which we may sell common stock for aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million. To date we have not received any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement.
In February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to certain purchasers an aggregate of 14,084,507 shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of $5.68, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 26, 2021 for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $80.0 million. We closed the Private Placement in March 2021 and received $75.2 million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and offering expenses.
Credit Facility
In October 2018, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The Loan Agreement provides for loan advances of up to $10.0 million. We drew down the first advance of $5.0 million as of the effective date of the Loan Agreement. The remaining $5.0 million under the facility was never drawn down and is no longer available for draw. The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants and restrictions that among other things, restrict our ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales or sale and leaseback transactions, and declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock. Interest on the loan advances is payable monthly at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of 1.5% above the prime rate and 6.5%. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, interest will increase to 5.0% above the rate that is otherwise applicable. Principal on the outstanding loan advance is repayable commencing on December 1, 2019 in 30 monthly payments through maturity. The maturity date of the loan advances is May 1, 2022.
Future Funding Requirements
We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses were $51.2 million and $47.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and into the second half of 2023.
As we continue the development of STS101, our operating expenses may increase substantially, as we seek to advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and prepare for
commercialization of STS101, if approved.
To the extent we continue development of STS101, we will continue to require additional capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize STS101 or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur. We may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of STS101. Our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, timing, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials for STS101, and most particularly, the SUMMIT Phase 3 efficacy trial for STS101, as well as any clinical program we may pursue in any foreign jurisdictions;
•
the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the scope and costs of manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;
•
the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of STS101;
•
the cost of building a sales force in anticipation of commercialization of STS101;
•
the cost and timing associated with commercializing STS101, if approved;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
any product liability or other lawsuits related to STS101;
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the commercialization of STS101;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies;
•
the payment of royalty payments owed under our existing license agreement;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
the costs associated with being a public company; and
•
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of STS101, if approved.
We are subject to the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Despite our implementation of a new development plan for STS101, such plan may change, which could significantly change the costs and timing associated with its development of STS101 and our operations. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. For example, the Loan Agreement contains many of these restrictions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate our development program and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others rights to STS101 in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. See “Risk Factors” for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.
Summary Statement of Cash Flows
The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below:
Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations to develop STS101, which resulted in a net loss of $51.2 million, adjusted for a decrease of accounts payable by $1.2 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.9 million, which amounts were partially offset by an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $3.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $5.4 million, net amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $0.7 million, loss on disposal of property and equipment of $0.6 million and depreciation expense of $0.4 million. The decrease in accounts payable and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued and other liabilities were primarily the result of the timing of payments to our vendors.
Net cash used in operating activities was $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations to develop STS101, which resulted in a net loss of $47.6 million, adjusted for a decrease of accounts payable by $1.6 million, which amounts were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.4 million, an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $1.0 million, depreciation expense of $0.2 million, non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $0.1 million, net amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $0.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.0 million. The decrease in accounts payable and prepaid expenses and other assets and increase in accrued and other liabilities were primarily the result of the timing of payments to our vendors.
Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $88.6 million and purchases of property and equipment of $2.0 million, which amounts were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $39.9 million.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $97.2 million, which amounts were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $34.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of $5.2 million mainly related to construction of the Company's dry powder nasal DHE filling station which is waiting for installation and final acceptance.
Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of $75.2 million of net cash proceeds from our Private Placement and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee plans of $0.1 million, partially offset by repayment of debt of $2.0 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily related to repayment of debt of $2.0 million and payment of offering costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.1 million.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
In October 2018, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The maturity date of the loan advances is May 1, 2022. Total future contractual maturities of the loan were $0.8 million as of December 31, 2021.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract organizations for clinical trials, manufacturing and testing and providing other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policy is the most critical to the judgement and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development
We monitor the activity under our various agreements with CMOs and other service providers to the extent possible through communication with each service provider, detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of actual expenses against budget, pre-approval of any changes in scope, and review of contractual terms. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimates, we will adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expenses and other current assets accordingly.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
