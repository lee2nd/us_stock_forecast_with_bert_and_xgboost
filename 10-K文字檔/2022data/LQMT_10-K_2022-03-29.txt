OVERVIEW
We are a materials technology company that develops and commercializes products made from amorphous alloys. Our Liquidmetal® family of alloys consists of a variety of proprietary bulk alloys and composites that utilize the advantages offered by amorphous alloy technology. We design, develop, and sell custom products and parts from bulk amorphous alloys to customers in various industries. We also partner with third-party manufacturers and licensees to develop and commercialize Liquidmetal alloy products.
Amorphous alloys are, in general, unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random atomic structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in other metals and alloys when they solidify. Liquidmetal alloys are proprietary amorphous alloys that possess a combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe will make them preferable to other materials in a variety of applications. The amorphous atomic structure of bulk alloys enables them to overcome certain performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in crystalline atomic structures, thus facilitating performance and processing characteristics superior in many ways to those of their crystalline counterparts. We believe the alloys and the molding technologies we employ can result in components for many applications that exhibit exceptional dimensional control and repeatability that rivals precision machining, excellent corrosion resistance, brilliant surface finish, high strength, high hardness, high elastic limit, alloys that are non-magnetic, and the ability to form complex shapes common to the injection molding of plastics. All of these characteristics are achievable from the molding process, so design engineers often do not have to select specific alloys to achieve one or more of the characteristics as is the case with crystalline materials. We believe these advantages could result in Liquidmetal alloys supplanting high-performance alloys, such as titanium and stainless steel, and other incumbent materials in a wide variety of applications. Moreover, we believe these advantages could enable the introduction of entirely new products and applications that are not possible or commercially viable with other materials.
Our revenues are derived from i) selling our bulk amorphous alloy custom products and parts for applications which include, but are not limited to, non-consumer electronic devices, medical products, automotive components, and sports and leisure goods; ii) selling tooling and prototype parts such as demonstration parts and test samples for customers with products in development; and iii) product licensing and royalty revenue.
Our cost of sales consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing, which include raw alloy and direct labor costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses currently consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, travel, consulting and professional fees, depreciation and amortization, insurance, office and administrative expenses, and other expenses related to our operations.
Research and development expenses represent salaries, related benefits expenses, consulting and contract services, expenses incurred for the design and testing of new processing methods, expenses for the development of sample and prototype products, and other expenses related to the research and development of Liquidmetal bulk alloys. Costs associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred. We plan to enhance our competitive position by improving our existing technologies and developing advances in amorphous alloy technologies. We believe that our research and development efforts will focus on the discovery of new alloy compositions, the development of improved processing technology, and the identification of new applications for our alloys.
In July 2019, the Company adopted the 2019 Restructuring Plan pursuant to which the Company elected to wind down its prior manufacturing operations at the Company’s Lake Forest, CA facility and seek to outsource the manufacture of parts utilizing the Company’s technology through domestic and international manufacturing partners. In connection with the 2019 Restructuring Plan, the Company reduced its management staff and shifted its business strategy from internal manufacture of parts and products for customers toward the use and reliance of outsourced manufacturers, including Yihao, a China-based company that is an affiliate of our largest beneficial stockholder and Chairman, Professor Li.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(a)
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenue and operating expenses
Revenue. Total revenue decreased by $135 to $811 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $989 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was attributable to lower product sale volumes associated with the Company’s continued transition from internal manufacturing to outsourced manufacturing.
Cost of sales. Cost of sales was $628, or 77% of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase from $621, or 63% of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in our cost of sales was primarily driven by lower product revenues with lower gross profit percentages. Once we are able to sustain and increase shipments of routine, commercial products and parts through our contract manufacturers, we expect our cost of sales percentages to decrease, stabilize, and be more predictable.
Gross profit. Our gross profit decreased by $185 from $368 as of December 31, 2020 to $183 as of December 31, 2021. Our gross margin percentage decreased from 37% as of December 31, 2020 to 23% as of December 31, 2021. Our gross profit percentages have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate based on production volumes and quoted production prices per unit and may not be representative of our future business. If we are able to sustain and increase shipments of routine, commercial products and parts through future orders to third party contract manufacturers, we expect our gross profit percentages to stabilize, increase, and be more predictable.
Selling, marketing, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, marketing, general, and administrative expenses increased by $362 to $4,160, or 513% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $3,798, or 384% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in expenses was primarily attributable to stock base compensation and severance expense in connection with the separation agreements the Company entered into with our former COO and Vice President of Finance, Dr. Bruce Bromage and Mr. Bryce Van, respectively.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by $26 to $84, or 10% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $110, or 11% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in expense was mainly due to reductions in employee compensation, and associated development initiatives from headcount reductions associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan. Going forward, we will continue to perform research and development of new Liquidmetal alloys and related processing capabilities, albeit on a reduced basis.
Gain on disposal of fixed assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded gains on the disposal of fixed assets of $35. There were no disposals during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Operating loss. Operating loss increased by $556 from $3,505 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $4,061 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Fluctuations in our operating loss are primarily attributable to variations in operating expenses, as discussed above.
We continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to expedite the adoption of our technology, but we have experienced long sales lead times for customer adoption of our technology. Until that time when we can either (i) increase our revenues with shipments of routine, commercial products and parts through third party contract manufacturers or (ii) obtain significant licensing revenues, we expect to continue to have operating losses for the foreseeable future.
Non-operational income and expenses
Interest and investment income. Interest and investment income relates to interest earned from our cash deposits and investments in debt securities for the respective periods. Interest and investment income was $154 and $378 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease during 2021 is due to higher overall yields on debt securities as a result of the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021.
Lease income. Lease income relates to straight-line rental income received under the Facility Lease. Such amounts were $529 and $484 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Net loss. Our annual net losses of $3,378 as of December 31, 2021 and $2,643 as of December 31, 2020 are primarily reflective of operating expenses associated with our on-going business as well as non-operational income, discussed above.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash used in operating activities
Cash used in operating activities totaled $2,730 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $2,330 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash was primarily used to fund operating expenses related to our business and product development efforts.
Cash provided by (used in) investing activities
Cash provided by investing activities totaled $5,307 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and cash used in investing activities totaled $15,799 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in investing activities primarily consist of purchases of debt securities in line with our investment strategy.
Cash provided by financing activities
Cash provided by financing activities totaled $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Financing arrangements and outlook
The Company has a relatively limited history of selling bulk amorphous alloy products and components on a mass-production scale. Furthermore, the ability of contract manufacturers to produce the Company’s products in desired quantities and at commercially reasonable prices is uncertain and is dependent on a variety of factors that are outside of the Company’s control, including the nature and design of the component, the customer’s specifications, and required delivery timelines. These factors have previously required that the Company engage in equity sales under various stock purchase agreements to support its operations and strategic initiatives.
However, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had $4,091 in cash and restricted cash, as well as $22,119 in investments in debt securities. The Company views this total of $26,210 as readily available sources of liquidity in the event needed to advance the Company’s existing strategy, and/or pursue an alternative strategy. As such, the Company anticipates that its current capital resources, when considering expected losses from operations, will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for the foreseeable future.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to our Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development arrangements with our Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to our consolidated financial statements since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimates that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results:
•
We recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards including FASB ASC Topic 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 summarizes certain points in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry.
Our revenue recognition policy complies with the requirements of ASC 606. As a majority of our sales revenue continues to be recognized when products are shipped, and there was no change in the recognition model historically applied to active license and royalty contracts under the new revenue standard, there was no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The impact to our results of operations is not material, on an on-going basis, because the analysis of our contracts under the new revenue standard supports a recognition model consistent with our previous revenue recognition model. Revenue on the majority of our contracts will continue to be recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer.
Products: Product revenues are primarily generated from the sale and prototyping of molds and bulk alloy products. Revenue is recognized when i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, ii) delivery has occurred, iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, iv) collection is probable and v) all obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement. When we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, we record deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. We will recognize deferred revenue as products revenue after it has transferred control of the goods or services to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria are met. Such amounts are not expected to be material on an ongoing basis.
Licensing and royalties: License revenue arrangements in general provide for the grant of an exclusive or non-exclusive right to manufacture and/or sell products covered by patented technologies owned or controlled by us. The intellectual property rights granted may be perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents, or can be granted for a defined period of time. Licensing revenues that are one-time fees upon the granting of the license are recognized when i) the license term begins in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process is complete, ii) when collectability is reasonably assured or upon receipt of an upfront fee, and iii) when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we have no further obligation with respect to the grant of the license. Licensing revenues that are related to royalties are recognized as the royalties are earned over the related period.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions: We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount for which it has the right to invoice for services performed.
•
We value our long-lived assets at the lower of cost or fair market value. We review long-lived assets to be held and used in operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired. These evaluations may result from significant decreases in the overall market outlook for our technology or the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as economic or operational analyses. If we concludes that the carrying value of certain assets will not be recovered based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment write-down is recorded to reduce the assets to their estimated fair value. Fair value is determined via market, cost and income based valuation techniques, as appropriate. The fair value is measured on a nonrecurring basis using a combination of quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and other unobservable adjustments to historical cost (Level 3) inputs. No cash impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
•
We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts deemed more likely than not of being realized. While we consider taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment would be made and income increased in the period of such determination. Likewise, in the event we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment would be made and charged to income in the period of such determination.
•
We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Share-based Payment, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of stock options is calculated by using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula that requires estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the term of the option. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
•
Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined on the basis of weighted-average cost. We perform an analysis of our inventory balances at least quarterly to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. The analysis of estimated net realizable value is based on customer orders, market trends and historical pricing. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value, the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated net realizable value.
•
We invest excess funds in debt securities to maximize investment yield, while maintaining liquidity and minimizing credit risk. Debt securities are carried at fair value and consist primarily of investments in obligations of the United States Treasury, various U.S. and foreign corporations, and certificates of deposits. We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale with all unrealized gains or losses included as part of other comprehensive income. We evaluate our debt securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis for potential other-than-temporary impairments in value. As a result of these assessments, we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment losses considered to be credit related for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Financial Instruments- Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. This update replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model (referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or "CECL"). The standard update, and its related amendments, will become effective for the fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2023. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this standard update, and its related amendments, on its consolidated financial statements, but is not expecting it will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.
