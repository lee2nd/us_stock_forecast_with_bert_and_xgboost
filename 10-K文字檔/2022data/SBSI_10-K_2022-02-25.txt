ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this report may be considered to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of and subject to the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management’s views as of any subsequent date. These statements may include words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “appear,” “believe,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,” “seek,” “intend,” “probability,” “risk,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “plans,” “potential,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, expectations, objectives, goals, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, discussions of the effect of our expansion, benefits of the Share Repurchase Plan, trends in asset quality, capital, liquidity, our ability to sell nonperforming assets, expense reductions, planned operational efficiencies and earnings from growth and certain market risk disclosures, including the impact of interest rates, tax reform, inflation and other economic factors are based upon information presently available to management and are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations. By their nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. Accordingly, our results could materially differ from those that have been estimated. The most recent factor that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants on our business, financial position, operations and prospects, including our ability to continue our business activities in certain communities we serve, the duration of the pandemic and its continued effects on financial markets, a reduction in financial transactions and business activities resulting in decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, increases in unemployment rates impacting our borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, our ability to manage liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, additional interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve and other government actions in response to the pandemic including regulations or laws enacted to counter the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:
•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants on our future consolidated financial condition and results of operations;
•general (i) political conditions, including, without limitation, governmental action and uncertainty resulting from U.S. and global political trends and (ii) economic conditions, either globally, nationally, in the State of Texas, or in the specific markets in which we operate, including, without limitation, the deterioration of the commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction and development, energy, oil and gas, credit or liquidity markets, which could cause an adverse change in our net interest margin, or a decline in the value of our assets, which could result in realized losses;

All written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or attributable to us are expressly qualified by this cautionary notice. We disclaim any obligation to update any factors or to announce publicly the result of revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments, unless otherwise required by law.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our accounting and reporting estimates conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting policies to include the following:
Allowance for Credit Losses. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses includes credit losses on loans as well as the off-balance-sheet credit exposure, which is reported as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for credit losses on loans is estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan based on expected credit losses. The off-balance-sheet credit exposure is evaluated using the expected credit losses using usage given defaults and credit conversion factors depending on the type of commitment and based upon historical usage rates. ASU 2016-13 replaced the previous incurred loss model which incorporated only known information as of the balance sheet date. The CECL model uses historical experience and current conditions for homogeneous pools of loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future events. Management selects models through which historical reserve factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools. Loss estimates revert to the long-term trend of each economic variable beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics. The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, we evaluate a range of economic scenarios, including a more severe economic forecast scenario, with varying speeds of recovery. Selecting a different forecast could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.
Refer to “Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures,” “Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,” “Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses” and “Note 17 - Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance. These include the following fully taxable-equivalent measures: Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE), which include the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21% to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. Interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments.
Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE). Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments and is not permitted under GAAP in the consolidated statements of income. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest margin (FTE) is the ratio of net interest income (FTE) to average earning assets. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference in the average yield on average earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently. Whenever we present a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and such comparable GAAP measure.
In the following table we present the reconciliation of net interest income to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% marginal tax rate for interest earned on tax-exempt assets such as municipal loans and investment securities (dollars in thousands), along with the calculation of net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE).
(1) These amounts are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and are non-GAAP measures.
Management believes adjusting net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread to a fully taxable-equivalent basis is a standard practice in the banking industry as these measures provide useful information to make peer comparisons. Tax-equivalent adjustments are reported in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the “Average Balances with Average Yields and Rates” tables under Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
COVID-19
During March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in response to the rapidly growing outbreak of the virus. COVID-19 significantly impacted local, national and global economies due to stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines. In compliance with social distancing guidelines issued by federal, state and local governments, we initially closed all of our grocery store branches. As stay-at-home orders were issued by local governments in our market areas to combat the spread of the virus, we closed all traditional lobbies and wealth management and trust offices to walk-in customers, however, most of these traditional locations were offering certain services by appointment only. All other banking services were available to customers through our drive-thrus, ATMs/ITMs and automated telephone, internet and mobile banking products. After careful consideration and implementation of additional safety precautions, all locations were reopened on June 1, 2020. We have since made adjustments to select branch hours and openings, and we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. Approximately 45% of our workforce has remote working capabilities, however most of our workforce have returned to our office and branch locations.
COVID-19 significantly disrupted supply chains, business activity and the overall economic and financial markets globally and in our footprint. As of December 31, 2021, economic conditions in Texas have returned close to pre-pandemic levels. Commercial activity has resumed to levels close to those existing prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. While the overall outlook has improved based on the availability of the vaccine, the risk of further resurgence and possible reimplementation of restrictions remains. Until the pandemic fully subsides, the potential for adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the economy by supporting individuals and businesses through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of financial relief. The CARES Act also included provisions to encourage financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers. As an SBA lender, we were well positioned to assist business customers in accessing funds available through the PPP implemented in April of 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law. This second coronavirus relief package granted additional funds for a new round of PPP loans. Additionally, it expanded the eligibility for loans and allowed certain businesses to request a second loan. The SBA began accepting applications for the second round of PPP loans on January 13, 2021, and we accepted new applications through April 6, 2021. During the first half 2021, we originated $112.3 million of additional PPP loans under this second round of PPP loans. At December 31, 2021, we had $31.0 million of approved PPP loans outstanding. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan was signed into law granting additional funds for unemployment benefits, individuals and other types of financial relief.
Additionally, we assisted both our consumer and commercial borrowers that experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19-related challenges. As of December 31, 2021, there were no remaining loans with payment deferrals. The decrease in the COVID-19 modified loans are the result of the loans coming out of the deferral periods and resuming performance.
OPERATING RESULTS
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our net income increased $31.2 million, or 38.0%, to $113.4 million from $82.2 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in net income was a direct result of a reversal of provision for credit losses of $17.0 million compared to a large increase in the allowance for credit losses of $20.2 million in the same period in 2020. The decrease in the provision was primarily due to an improved economic forecast and improved asset quality. The increase in net income was also due to the $18.1 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $15.8 million decrease in interest income, the $6.1 million increase in income tax expense and the $1.7 million increase in noninterest expense. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.00, or 40.5%, to $3.47 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $2.47 for the same period in 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income increased $7.6 million, or 10.2%, to $82.2 million, from $74.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the $17.5 million increase in net interest income, the $7.4 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by the $15.1 million increase in the provision for credit losses after adopting CECL and the $4.0 million increase in noninterest expense. Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.27, or 12.3%, to $2.47 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.20 for the same period in 2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the economic environment related to COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the economic assumptions used in the CECL model.
The following table sets forth selected financial data regarding our results of operations and financial position for, and as of the end of, each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021. This information should be read in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as set forth in this report (in thousands, except per share data):
(1)Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses is the sum of the provision for loan losses and the provision for off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for off-balance-sheet credit exposures was included in other noninterest expense.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Our total assets increased $251.4 million, or 3.6%, to $7.26 billion at December 31, 2021 from $7.01 billion at December 31, 2020. Our securities portfolio increased by $158.8 million, or 5.9%, to $2.86 billion, compared to $2.70 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in our securities portfolio was comprised of an increase of $587.4 million in investment securities, partially offset by a decrease of $428.6 million in MBS as the composition of the securities portfolio continued to change as municipal bonds and, to a lesser extent, corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury Notes increased while MBS decreased. Our FHLB stock decreased $10.9 million, or 43.1%, to $14.4 million from $25.3 million at December 31, 2020, due to the decline in our FHLB borrowings during 2021, reducing the amount of FHLB stock we are required to hold.
Loans at December 31, 2021 were $3.65 billion, a decrease of $12.6 million, or 0.3%, compared to $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Our PPP loans, a component of the commercial loan category, decreased $183.8 million during the year due to forgiveness payments received for loans funded under the CARES Act. Excluding PPP loans, total loans increased $171.2 million, or 5.0%, due to increases of $302.4 million in commercial real estate loans, $45.7 million in commercial loans (excluding PPP loans) and $34.1 million in municipal loans. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $134.1 million in construction loans, $68.8 million in 1-4 family residential loans and $8.1 million in loans to individuals. Loans held for sale decreased $2.0 million, or 54.4%, to $1.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $3.7 million at December 31, 2020.
Our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2021 decreased $5.9 million, or 33.6%, to $11.6 million and represented 0.16% of total assets, compared to $17.5 million, or 0.25% of total assets, at December 31, 2020. Nonaccruing loans decreased $5.2 million, or 67.1%, to $2.5 million, and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans decreased to 0.07% at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.21% at December 31, 2020. Restructured loans were $9.1 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 5.9%, from $9.6 million at December 31, 2020. There were no OREO properties as of December 31, 2021, compared to $106,000 at December 31, 2020.
Our deposits increased $790.0 million, or 16.0%, to $5.72 billion at December 31, 2021 from $4.93 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by PPP loan disbursements and stimulus checks deposited during the first half of 2021, an increase in brokered deposits, and to a lesser extent, an increase in public fund deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, brokered deposits increased $156.9 million, or 113.7%, associated with funding our cash flow hedge swaps in place of the FHLB advances to obtain lower cost funding.
Total FHLB borrowings decreased $488.5 million, or 58.7%, to $344.0 million at December 31, 2021, from $832.5 million at December 31, 2020.
Our subordinated notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, decreased $98.7 million, or 50.0%, to $98.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $197.3 million at December 31, 2020. On November 6, 2020, we issued 3.875% coupon $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due on November 15, 2030. On September 30, 2021, we redeemed our 5.50% coupon $100.0 million subordinated notes due September 30, 2026. Refer to “Note 9 - Long-term Debt” in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of the terms of the redemption of the subordinated notes.
Our total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 increased 4.2%, or $36.9 million, to $912.2 million, or 12.6% of total assets, compared to $875.3 million, or 12.5% of total assets, at December 31, 2020. The increase in shareholders’ equity was the result of net income of $113.4 million, net issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $7.2 million, stock compensation expense of $3.0 million and common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan of $1.4 million. These increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid of $44.6 million, the repurchase of $34.1 million of our common stock and other comprehensive loss of $9.4 million.
Economic conditions in our market areas are relatively strong with economic activity having quickly returned close to pre-pandemic levels. Worker shortages especially in the restaurant, hospitality and retail industries combined with supply chain disruptions impacting numerous industries has had some impact on the level of economic growth. Overall, Texas continues to experience economic growth due to company relocations and expansions combined with overall population growth.
Key financial indicators management follows include, but are not limited to, numerous interest rate sensitivity and interest rate risk indicators, credit risk, operations risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, regulatory risk, inflation risk, competition risk, yield curve risk, U.S. agency MBS prepayment risk and economic risk indicators.
BALANCE SHEET STRATEGY
Determining the appropriate size of the balance sheet is one of the critical decisions any bank makes. Our balance sheet is not merely the result of a series of micro-decisions, but rather the size is controlled based on the economics of assets compared to the economics of funding and funding sources. Changing interest rate environments and economic conditions require that we monitor the interest rate sensitivity of the assets, the funding driving our growth and closely align ALCO objectives accordingly.
During 2021 and 2020, the composition of our funding changed as we replaced approximately $700 million of our more interest rate sensitive funding sources, FHLB advances and brokered deposits, with lower cost non-maturity deposits, which increased $1.7 billion, or 51% during this period. At December 31, 2021, 95% of our remaining FHLB advances and brokered deposits were swapped at a fixed rate.
We utilize wholesale funding and securities to enhance overall profitability by maximizing the use of our capital, determining acceptable levels of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk consistent with prudent capital management. This balance sheet strategy currently consists of borrowing funds from the FHLB and the brokered funds market. These funds are invested primarily in U.S. agency MBS and long-term municipal securities. Although U.S. agency MBS often carry lower yields than loans we make, these securities generally (i) increase the overall quality of our assets because of either the implicit or explicit guarantees of the U.S. Government, (ii) are more liquid than individual loans and (iii) may be used to collateralize our borrowings or other obligations.
Risks associated with this asset structure include a potentially lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to our peers, changes in the slope of the yield curve, increased interest rate risk, the length of interest rate cycles, changes in volatility or spreads associated with the MBS and municipal securities, the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments and credit risks associated with the municipal securities. See “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business” in this report for a discussion of risks related to interest rates. An additional risk is significant increases in interest rates, especially long-term interest rates, which could adversely impact the fair value of the AFS securities portfolio and could also impact our equity capital. Due to the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments, the length of interest rate cycles and the slope of the interest rate yield curve, net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under the scenarios modeled by our ALCO and described under “
