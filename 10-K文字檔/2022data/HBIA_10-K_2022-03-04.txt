COVID-19: Update on Company Action and Ongoing Risks
Our response to COVID-19 continues to be focused on how we can best serve our employees, customers, and communities. We implemented additional safety measures to achieve appropriate social distancing for both customers and employees throughout our locations. We have continued to adjust procedures and restrictions based on local conditions and generally in alignment with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control. Drive-thru services remain available as well as all ATM’s to complete needed transactions. Customers are also able to directly contact our bankers through calling the customer contact center, engaging with a digital banker via the HERE by Hills Bank app, or through Hills Bank Online which is available 24/7.
Lending Assistance
The Bank continues to work with customers to determine how best to serve them, including providing short-term modifications for customers primarily through deferrals of principal only payments for three to six months. Throughout 2020, COVID-19 related payment deferrals provided for customers totaled approximately 14.82% of total loans. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, COVID-19 related payment deferrals were approximately 0.12% and 1.20% of total loans, respectively.
The Bank continues to assist customers through this difficult time in the best manner possible by providing $127.10 million of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans through December 31, 2020. With the passage of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act 2021 in late December 2020, the Bank provided additional PPP loans in 2021 totaling $58.34 million through December 31, 2021 to further assist our customers. The PPP loans have a two or five year term and earn interest at 1%. Loans funded through the PPP program are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government if certain criteria are met. The Bank believes that the majority of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank has outstanding PPP loan balances of $5.34 million and for the year ended December 31, 2021 has received total forgiveness payments of $140.1 million from the SBA.
Financial Exposures
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to represent an unprecedented challenge to the global economy in general and the financial services sector in particular. However, given the emergence of multiple new and more infectious variants of COVID-19 along with the hesitancy of a significant portion of the U.S. population to become vaccinated, there is still significant uncertainty regarding the overall length of the pandemic and the aggregate impact that it will have on global and regional economies, including uncertainties regarding the potential positive effects of governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic. Our credit administration continues to closely monitor and analyze the higher risk segments within the loan portfolio, tracking loan payment deferrals, customer liquidity and providing timely reports to senior management and the board of directors. Based on the Company’s capital levels, prudent underwriting policies, loan concentration diversification and our geographic footprint, we currently expect to be able to continue to manage the economic risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic and remain adequately capitalized. However, the Company may be required to make additional loan loss provisions as warranted by the fluid COVID-19 situation.
Overview
The Company is a bank holding company engaged, through its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, in the business of commercial banking. The Company’s subsidiary is Hills Bank and Trust Company, Hills, Iowa. The Bank was formed in Hills, Iowa in 1904. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank extending its services to individuals, businesses, governmental units and
institutional customers primarily in the communities of Hills, Iowa City, Coralville, North Liberty, Lisbon, Mount Vernon, Kalona, Wellman, Cedar Rapids, Marion and Washington, Iowa.
The Company’s net income for 2021 was $48.09 million compared to $38.65 million in 2020 and $45.32 million in 2019. Diluted earnings per share were $5.16, $4.12, and $4.85 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Bank’s net interest income is the largest component of the Bank’s revenue, and is a function of the average earning assets and the net interest margin percentage. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank achieved a net interest margin of 2.75% and 3.00%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased by $2.82 million. In 2021, net interest income increased $1.77 million due to growth of $424.15 million in the Bank's average earning assets and decreases in certficates of deposit and FHLB borrowings as well as increased $1.05 million due to interest rate changes.
Highlights with respect to items on the Company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included the following:
•Total assets were $4.045 billion, an increase of $262.20 million since December 31, 2020.
•Cash and cash equivalents were $781.92 million, an increase of $207.61 million since December 31, 2020. A substantial portion of the increase can be attributed to increased savings with the current negative economic environment due to the pandemic and equity investors fleeing volatile capital markets in an effort to preserve principal.
•Loans, net of allowance for credit losses and unamortized fees and costs, totaling $2.631 billion, a decrease of $87.18 million since December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to the forgiveness of PPP loans totaling a net of $81.16 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Loans held for sale decreased $38.23 million since December 31, 2020 due to the slowdown in mortgage loan refinance activity later in 2021.
•Tax credit real estate increased by $2.54 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to a $4.18 million investment in a multi-family affordable housing rental property.
•Deposit growth of $341.43 million in 2021. Deposits increased to $3.534 billion and included $51.59 million of brokered deposits. A substantial portion of the increase can be attributed to increased savings with the current negative economic environment due to the pandemic.
•FHLB borrowings decreased $105.00 million due to prepaying all outstanding FHLB borrowings compared to December 31, 2020.
•Liabilities as of December 31, 2021 include $3.85 million of allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures under CECL compared to zero under the incurred loss model as of December 31, 2020.
•Stockholders’ equity increased $22.37 million to $438.45 million in 2021, with dividends having been paid in 2021 of $8.77 million.
Reference is made to Note 13 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements which relate to methods used by the Company in recording certain assets and liabilities on its consolidated financial statements.
The return on average equity was 11.29% in 2021 compared to 9.82% in 2020. The Company remains well-capitalized as of December 31, 2021 with total risk-based capital at 20.24% and Tier 1 risk-based capital at 17.25%. The minimum regulatory guidelines are 8% and 6% respectively. The Company paid a dividend per share of $0.940 in 2021, $0.890 in 2020 and $0.820 in the year ended December 31, 2019.
A detailed discussion of the financial position and results of operations follows this overview.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained within these financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those which are related to the allowance for credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the allowance for credit losses use the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. The following is a discussion of the methodologies used by the Company with the adoption of ASC 326.
ASC 326 CECL Adoption: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense in the financial statements. Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, involve the application of highly sensitive and judgmental estimates and assumptions. Some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are highly complex and contain substantial inherent uncertainties. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including the allowance for credit losses (see Note 3 - Loans and Note 2 - Securities) and the fair value of debt securities (see Note 2 - Securities).
We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the inherent judgments and assumptions and the potential sensitivity of the financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial statements. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements are appropriate. For a further description of our accounting policies, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
The allowance for credit losses for loans represents management's estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.
We employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for credit losses that has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics.
Based upon this methodology, management establishes an asset-specific allowance for loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans based on the amount of expected credit losses calculated on those loans and charges off amounts determined to be uncollectible. Factors we consider in measuring the extent of expected credit loss include payment status, collateral value, borrower financial condition, guarantor support and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.
When a loan does not share risk characteristics with other loans, we measure expected credit loss as the difference between the amortized cost basis in the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate except that, for collateral- dependent loans, credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis in the loan and the fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of the collateral is adjusted for the estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on the sale (rather than only on the operation) of the collateral. In accordance with our appraisal policy, the fair value of collateral-dependent loans is based upon independent third-party appraisals or on collateral valuations prepared by in-house evaluations. Once a third-party appraisal is greater than one year old, or if its determined that market conditions, changes to the property, changes in intended use of the property or other factors indicate that an appraisal is no longer reliable, we perform an internal collateral valuation to assess whether a change in collateral value requires an additional adjustment to carrying value. When we receive an updated appraisal or collateral valuation, management reassesses the need for adjustments to the loan's expected credit loss measurements and, where appropriate, records an adjustment. If the calculated expected credit loss is determined to be permanent, fixed or nonrecoverable, the credit loss portion of the loan will be charged off against the allowance for credit losses. Loans designated having significantly increased credit
risk are generally placed on nonaccrual and remain in that status until all principal and interest payments are current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement are reasonably assured, at which point the loan is returned to accrual status.
In estimating the component of the allowance for credit losses for loans that share common risk characteristics, loans are segregated into loan classes. Loans are designated into loan classes based on loans pooled by product types and similar risk characteristics or areas of risk concentration. Credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loan type and purpose. This model calculates an expected life-of-loan loss percentage for each loan category by considering the probability of default using historical life-of-loan analysis periods for agricultural, 1 to 4 family first and junior liens, commercial and consumer segments, and the severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred per loan class.
The component of the allowance for credit losses for loans that share common risk characteristics also considers factors for each loan class to adjust for differences between the historical period used to calculate historical default and loss severity rates and expected conditions over the remaining lives of the loans in the portfolio related to:
•Lending policies and procedures;
•International, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets;
•The nature of the loan portfolio, including the terms of the loans;
•The experience, ability and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff;
•The volume and severity of past due and adversely classified or graded loans and the volume of nonaccrual loans;
•The quality of our loan review and process;
•The value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;
•The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; and
•The effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio.
Such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect management expectation of future conditions based on a reasonable and supportable forecast. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made, the bank reduces, on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the loans, the adjustments so that model reverts back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss.
The credit loss expense recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio. The amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors.
The allowance for credit losses for loans, as reported in our consolidated balance sheet, is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. For further information on the allowance for credit losses for loans, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to the financial statements of this Form 10-K.
This discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein, as well as other relevant portions of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Financial Position
Total assets at December 31, 2021 increased $262.20 million, or 6.93%, from the prior year-end. The largest growth in assets in 2021 occurred in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which increased $207.61 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Net Loans decreased $(48.95) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Loans held for sale to the secondary market decreased $(38.23) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Loans held for investment represent the largest component of the Bank’s earning assets. Loans held for investment were $2.661 billion and $2.711 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The local economy that generated consistent demand for loans was a significant factor in the trend of increasing net loans in past years. The trend of increasing Net Loans did slow in 2021 and 2020 and may not continue, and as a result, may not be indicative of future performance. The primary reason for the decrease in 2021 was the forgiveness of PPP loans totaling a net of $81.16 million that were provided to customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed previously. Without the decrease due to PPP loan forgiveness, loans held for investment increased $30.61 million.
Commercial and financial loans represent a significant portion of the loan growth. These loans increased $16.92 million in 2021 excluding the impact of PPP loans. Construction loans, both 1 to 4 family residential and land development and commercial, had significant growth totaling $24.48 million in 2021. Agricultural loans increased $12.09 million in 2021 though farmland mortgages decreased $14.40 million due to significant competition in the Bank's trade area.
On a net basis, the Company collected $52.02 million in loan payments from customers and the SBA for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to loan originations of $72.14 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the collections from the forgiveness of PPP loans. The Company does not engage in significant participation activity and does not purchase participations from outside its established trade area. The Company’s policy allows for the purchase or sale of participations related to existing customers or to participate in community development activity. The Company held participations purchased of $17.18, $19.83 and $15.17 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The participations purchased were less than one percent of loans held for investment for each of the three years.
The Company did not experience a material change in the composition of its loans held for investment in 2021 or 2020. Residential real estate loans, including first and junior liens, were $1,023.91 million and $1,019.92 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The dollar total of residential real estate loans increased 0.39% in 2021 and decreased 3.78% in 2020. Residential real estate loans were 38.49% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 37.63% at December 31, 2020. Commercial real estate loans totaled $401.38 million at December 31, 2021, a 3.78% decrease over the December 31, 2020 total of $417.14 million. Commercial real estate loans increased 3.72% in 2020. Commercial real estate loans represented 15.09%, 15.39% and 15.24% of the Company’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company monitors its commercial real estate level so that it does not have a concentration in that category that exceeds 300% of its capital. Commercial real estate loan concentration was 155.64% of capital as of December 31, 2021.
The following table shows the composition of loans (before deducting the allowance for credit losses) as of December 31 for each of the last five years. The table does not include loans held for sale to the secondary market.
There were no foreign loans outstanding for any of the years presented.
The following table shows the principal payments due on loans as of December 31, 2021:
(1)A significant portion of the commercial loans are due in one year or less. A significant percentage of the loans will be re-evaluated prior to their maturity and are likely to be extended.
(2)Commercial, multi-family, construction 1 to 4 family residential, construction land development and commercial, and agricultural real estate loans are reflected in the Commercial and Agricultural total.
The overall economy in the Company’s trade area, Johnson, Linn and Washington Counties, remains in stable condition with levels of unemployment below national and state levels. The following table shows unemployment and estimated median income information as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Competition for quality loans and deposits may continue to be a challenge. The increased competition for both loans and deposits could result in a lower interest rate margin that could result in lower net interest income if the volume of loans and deposits does not increase to offset any such reduction in the interest margin.
Total deposits increased by $341.43 million in 2021. Deposits increased by $531.20 million in 2020. As of June 30, 2021 (latest data available from the FDIC), Johnson County total deposits were $11.077 billion and the Company’s deposits were $2.272 billion, which represent a 20.51% market share. The Company had nine office locations in Johnson County as of June 30, 2021. The total banking locations in Johnson County was 48 as of June 30, 2021. At June 30, 2020, the Company’s deposits were $2.060 billion or a 21.71% market share. As of June 30, 2021, Linn County total deposits were $8.580 billion and there were 102 total banking locations in the county. The seven Linn County offices of the Company had deposits of $764 million or a 8.9% share of the market. The Company’s Linn County deposits at June 30, 2020 were $612 million and represented a 7.9% market share. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s three Washington County offices had deposits of $287 million which was 34.5% of the County’s total deposits of $832 million. Washington County had a total of 14 banking locations as of June 30, 2021. In 2020, the Company’s Washington County deposits were $254 million or a 33.0% market share.
The following tables show the amounts of the Company's average deposits and average rates paid on such deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the composition of the certificates of deposit issued in denominations in excess of $250,000 as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Investment securities increased $139.36 million in 2021. In 2020, investment securities increased by $50.18 million. The investment portfolio consists of $551.35 million of securities that are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gain or loss, net of
income taxes, reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The securities portfolio is used for liquidity and pledging purposes and to provide a rate of return that is acceptable to management.
The following tables show the carrying value of the investment securities held by the Bank, including stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank, as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the maturities and weighted average yields of the investment securities, computed using amortized cost on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of 21%, as of December 31, 2021:
As of December 31, 2021, the Company held no investment securities exceeding 10% of stockholders’ equity, other than securities of the U.S. Government agencies and corporations. The Company does not hold any investments in FNMA preferred stock, any pooled trust preferred stocks or other preferred stock type investments. See Note 2 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
During 2021, the major funding source for the growth in loans and other assets was the $341.43 million increase in deposits. In 2020, the major source of funding for the growth in loans was deposit growth of $531.20 million. Brokered deposits totaled $51.59 million and $74.08 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total advances from the FHLB were $0.00 million at December 31, 2021 and $105.00 million in 2020. The FHLB funding source is considered when loan growth exceeds core deposit increases and the interest rates on funds borrowed from the FHLB are favorable compared to other funding alternatives.
Stockholders’ equity was $438.45 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $416.08 million at December 31, 2020. The Company’s capital resources are discussed in detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Over the last five years, the Company has realized cumulative earnings of $196.88 million and paid shareholders dividends of $38.24 million, or 19.42% of earnings, while maintaining capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements.
The following table presents the return on average assets, return on average stockholders' equity, the dividend payout ratio and average stockholders’ equity to average assets ratio for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Net Income Overview
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the last three years are as presented below:
Net income for 2021 increased by $9.44 million or 24.42% and diluted earnings per share increased by 25.24%. In 2021, net interest income, before credit loss expense, increased by $2.89 million due to the following reasons: 1) decrease in interest income of $6.44 million primarily due to decreases in interest rates and 2) decrease in interest expense of $9.33 million due to interest rate decreases and decreases in the volume of certificates of deposit and FHLB borrowings. Noninterest income increased by $5.13 million, the credit loss expense decreased by $9.87 million and total noninterest expenses increased by $5.71 million.
Annual fluctuations in the Company's net income are driven primarily by three important factors. The first important factor is net interest margin. Net interest income of $104.46 million in 2021 was derived from the Company's $3.866 billion of average earning assets and its net interest margin of 2.75%, compared to $3.442 billion of average earning assets and a 3.00% net interest margin in 2020. The importance of net interest margin is illustrated by the fact that a decrease or an increase in the net interest margin of 10 basis points would result in a $3.87 million decrease or increase in income before taxes. Net interest income for the Company increased primarily due to the continued low interest rates on interest bearing deposits resulting in decreased interest expense of $9.33 million compared to 2020. $7.34 million of the decrease in interest expense was due to interest rate decreases and $1.99 million was primarily due to volume decreases in certificates of deposit and FHLB borrowings. The Company expects net interest compression to impact earnings for the foreseeable future due to competition for loans and deposits combined with the interest rate decreases by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company believes growth in net interest income will be contingent on the growth of the Company’s earning assets and maintaining yield on loans.
The second significant factor affecting the Company's net income is the credit loss expense recorded under CECL. The majority of the Company's interest-earning assets are in loans outstanding, which amounted to $2.666 billion at the end of 2021. The Company’s allowance for credit losses was $35.47 million at December 31, 2021. Expected credit loss expense is computed on a quarterly basis and is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level considered by management to appropriately account for the estimated current expected credit losses within the Bank's loan portfolio. The expense reflects a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, the overall composition of the loan portfolio and loan concentrations, the borrowers’ ability to repay, past loss experience, loan collateral values, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, adjustments for prepayments and curtailments, the level of collateral-dependent loans and loans past due ninety days or more. In addition, management considers the credit quality of the loans based on management’s review of problem and watch loans, including loans with historically higher credit risk. Credit loss expense was a reduction of expense of $5.51 million in 2021 under CECL compared to an expense of $4.36 million in 2020 and a reduction of expense of $2.88 million in 2019 under the incurred loss model. The decrease is attributable to improvements in the economic factor forecasts, primarily Iowa unemployment in the first quarter 2021, and continued improvement in asset quality, relative to the sizable expense taken for the first half of 2020 from management increases to qualitative factors as a result of the significant economic uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. The Company believes that credit loss expense is expected to be dependent on the Company’s loan growth, local economic conditions, including, but not limited to, conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant risks and uncertainties related thereto, asset quality and will continue to have potential volatility for the foreseeable future resulting from the uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The third significant factor affecting the Company’s net income is noninterest income, primarily net gain on the sale of loans, services charges and trust fees. The net gain on the sale of loans was $7.59 million and $6.68 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 13.63% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The amount of the net gain on sale of secondary market mortgage loans in each year can vary significantly. The volume of activity in these types of loans is directly related to the level of interest rates and has been significantly impacted by the Federal Reserve Board's reduction of the federal funds rate to 0.25%, resulting in a significant amount of mortgage loan refinance activity. Services charges and fees were $11.77 million and $10.19 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 15.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This is primarily due to an increase in debit and credit card interchange fees of $1.52 million compared to 2020 with increased usage activity. Trust fees were $13.52 million and $10.28 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 31.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This is primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of $0.37 billion from $2.18 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $2.55 billion as of December 31, 2021 and increased investment transaction activity.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the excess of the interest and fees received on interest-earning assets over the interest paid on the interest-bearing liabilities. The factors that have the greatest impact on net interest income are the volume of average earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the net interest margin. The volume of average earning assets has continued to grow each year, primarily due to excess cash for 2021. The volume of interest-bearing liabilities also grew in 2021 due to growth of interest-bearing demand and savings deposits. The net interest margin was 2.75% in 2021, 3.00% in 2020 and 3.18% in 2019. The measure is shown on a tax-equivalent basis using a rate of 21% for 2021, 2020 and 2019 to make the interest earned on taxable and nontaxable assets more comparable. Interest income and expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are indicated on the following table:
(1) Presented on a tax equivalent basis using a rate of 21% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Interest income includes certain loan origination and document preparation fees, which comprise approximately 2.0% of the amounts indicated.
Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis changed in 2021 as follows:
Rate/volume variances are allocated on a consistent basis using the absolute values of changes in volume compared to the absolute values of the changes in rates. Loan fees included in interest income are not material. Interest on nontaxable securities and loans is shown at tax equivalent amounts.
Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis changed in 2020 as follows:
A summary of the average yields, average rates paid, net interest spread and margin is as follows:
(1)Non-accruing loans have been included in the average loan balances for purposes of this computation.
(2)Net interest spread is the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the yield on average interest-paying liabilities stated on a tax equivalent basis using a federal rate of 21% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. The net interest spread decreased 17 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 and the net interest spread decreased 10 basis points compared to 2019.
(3)Net interest margin is net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, divided by average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points in 2021. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019.
In March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee decreased the target rate to 0.25%. Interest rates on loans are generally affected by the target rate since interest rates for the U.S. Treasury market normally correlate to the Federal Reserve Board federal funds rate. In pricing of loans and deposits, the Bank considers the U.S. Treasury indexes as benchmarks in determining interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, the average rate indexes for the one, three and five year indexes were 0.39%, 0.97% and 1.26%, respectively. The one year index increased 290.00% from December 31, 2020, the three year index increased 470.59% and the five year index increased 250.00%.
CECL Adoption and Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
The framework requires that management's estimate reflects credit losses over the full remaining expected life of each credit and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The adoption resulted in the recognition on January 1, 2021 of cumulative effect adjustments of $2.75 million related to the ACL for loans and $3.58 million related to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures.
Credit loss expense was a reduction of expense of $5.51 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an expense of $4.36 million in 2020 under the incurred loss model, a decrease of expense of $9.87 million. The credit loss expense includes expense of $0.27 million related to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. Credit loss expense is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level considered by management to appropriately account for the estimated current expected credit losses within the Bank's loan portfolio. The credit loss expense taken to fund the allowance for credit losses is computed on a quarterly basis and is a result of management’s determination of the quality of the loan portfolio. The expense reflects a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, the overall composition of the loan portfolio and loan concentrations, the impact on the borrowers’ ability to repay, past loss experience, loan collateral values, the level of collateral-dependent loans and loans past due ninety days or more. In addition, management considers the credit quality of the
loans based on management’s review of special mention and substandard loans, including loans with historical higher credit risks. Also, under CECL, a significant component in estimating expected credit losses are economic forecasts such as Iowa unemployment, all-transactions house price index for Iowa and Iowa real GDP. The Company believes that credit loss expense is expected to be dependent on the Company’s loan growth, local economic conditions, including, but not limited to, conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant risks and uncertainties related thereto, asset quality and will continue to have potential volatility for the foreseeable future resulting from the adoption of CECL and the uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of the allowance to outstanding loans was 1.33% and 1.37% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The credit loss expense totaled a reduction of expense of $5.51 million in 2021, an expense of $4.36 million in 2020 and a reduction of expense of $2.88 million in 2019. Loan recoveries net of charge-offs were $1.43 million in 2021, loan charge-offs net of recoveries were $1.05 million in 2020 and loan charge-offs net of recoveries were $1.17 million in 2019. Management has determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021, and that the loan portfolio is diversified and secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. This process involves a high degree of management judgment; however, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive and well-documented applied analysis of the Company’s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total nonperforming loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs. However, there is no assurance losses will not exceed the allowance, and any growth in the loan portfolio or uncertainty in the general economy will require that management continue to evaluate the adequacy of the ACL and make additional provisions in future periods as deemed necessary.
Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to nonaccrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction payment and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If we determine that a loan amount, or portion thereof, is uncollectible, the loan’s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. The Bank’s credit and legal departments undertake a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if an additional specific reserve and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the loan to minimize realized loss.
In certain circumstances, the Bank may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due. In most cases, the modification is either a reduction in interest rate, conversion to interest only payments, deferral of payments or extension of the maturity date. Generally, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term, so concessionary modification is granted to the borrower that otherwise would not be considered. TDR loans accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles. The Bank’s TDR loans occur on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes.
The Bank regularly reviews loans in the portfolio and assesses whether the loans are nonperforming. If the loans are nonperforming, the Bank determines if a specific reserve is appropriate. In addition, the Bank's management also reviews and, where determined necessary, provides allowances for particular loans based upon (1) reviews of specific borrowers and (2) management’s assessment of areas that management considers are of higher credit risk, including loans that have been restructured.
The extent to which collateral secures collateral-dependent loans and changes in the extent to which collateral secures its collateral-dependent loans are described below. Collateral-dependent loans decreased $4.10 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Collateral-dependent loans include any loan that has been placed on nonaccrual status, accruing loans past due 90 days or more and TDR loans. Collateral-dependent loans also include loans that, based on management’s evaluation of current information and events, the Company expects to be unable to collect in full according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Collateral-dependent loans were 0.63% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2021 and 0.76% as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in collateral-dependent loans is due to a decrease of $0.55 million in loans with a specific reserve, a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $0.36 million, a decrease in 90 days or more accruing loans of $0.86 million and a decrease in TDR loans of $2.33 million from December 31, 2020 to December 30, 2021. There were no significant changes noted in the extent to which collateral secures collateral-dependent loans. See Note 1 Adoption of New Financial Accounting Standard for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment. A description of the Bank's credit quality indicators are discussed in Note 3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table summarizes the Company's impaired loans and non-performing assets as of December 31 for each of the years presented:
(1)The gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was $0.46 million in 2021 and $0.66 million in 2020. The amount of interest income on the loans that was included in income was $0.44 million in 2021 and $0.57 million in 2020.
(2)The accruing loans past due 90 days or more are still believed to be adequately collateralized. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when management believes the collection of future principal and interest is not reasonably assured.
(3)Total TDR loans were $10.20, $13.22, $13.71, $13.38 and $12.09 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in the total nonaccrual loans were $2.28, $2.97, $4.34, $4.84 and $3.62 million of TDR loans as of December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The ratio of allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans increased to 213.25% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 178.83% as of December 31, 2020. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to the reduction in non-performing loans compared to 2020. The ratio of non-performing loans to total gross loans was 0.63% and 0.76% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in the 2021 ratio is primarily due to the decrease in TDR loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more.
Other factors that are considered in determining the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio are the vacancy rates for both residential and commercial space, current equity the borrower has in the property and overall financial strength of the customer including cash flow to continue to fund loan payments. The Company also considers the state of the total economy including unemployment levels. In most instances, the borrowers have used in their rental projections of income at least a 10% vacancy rate. As of December 31, 2021, the unemployment levels in Johnson County and Linn County were 2.5% and 3.3%, respectively, compared to 2.8% and 3.8% in December of 2020. These levels compare favorably to the State of Iowa at 3.5% and the national unemployment level at 3.9% in December 2021 compared to 3.1% and 6.7%, respectively in December 2020.
The residential rental vacancy rates in 2020 and 2021 in Johnson and Linn County were estimated between 6.0% and 8.0%. The State of Iowa vacancy rate is 7.5% and the national rate is 5.6% with the Midwest rate at 6.5%. These vacancy rates one year ago were 8.5%, 6.5% and 7.8%, respectively. The Company continues to consider those vacancy rates among other factors in its current evaluation of the real estate portion of its loan portfolio. Favorable vacancy rates may not continue in 2021, and vacancy rates may rise and affect the overall quality of the loan portfolio.
See Note 3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on loans.
SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE
The allowance for credit losses balance is also affected by the charge-offs and recoveries for the periods presented. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, recoveries were $2.74 million, $1.87 million and $1.80 million, respectively; charge-offs were $1.32 million, $2.92 million and $2.97 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Overall credit quality may deteriorate in 2022. Such deterioration could cause increases in non-performing loans, allowance for credit losses, credit loss expense and net charge-offs. Management will monitor changing market conditions as a part of its allowance for credit loss methodology. The following table summarizes the Bank's loan loss experience for the years ended December 31 for each of the years presented:
ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The following table presents the allowance for credit losses by type of loans, the percentage of the allocation for each category to the total allowance and the percentage of all loans in each category to total loans as of December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017:
The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio. However, if economic conditions deteriorate, certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require increases in the allowance for credit losses. The Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis and will consider the impact of economic conditions on the borrowers’ ability to repay, loan collateral values, past collection experience, the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and such other factors that deserve current recognition.
Noninterest Income
The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The noninterest income of the Company was $33.46 million in 2021 compared to $28.34 million in 2020. The increase of $5.13 million in 2021 was the result of a combination of factors discussed below.
The net gain on the sale of loans was $7.59 million and $6.68 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 13.63% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The amount of the net gain on sale of secondary market mortgage loans in each year can vary significantly. The volume of activity in these types of loans is directly related to the level of interest rates and has been significantly impacted by the Federal Reserve Board's reduction of the federal funds rate to 0.25%, resulting in a significant amount of mortgage loan refinance activity. The servicing
of the loans sold into the secondary market is not retained by the Company so these loans do not provide an ongoing stream of income.
Trust fees were $13.52 million and $10.28 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 31.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This is primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of $0.37 billion from $2.18 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $2.55 billion as of December 31, 2021 and increased investment transaction activity. The trust assets that are the most volatile are those that are held in common stocks, which amount to approximately 71% of assets under management. In 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 18.73%.
Services charges and fees were $11.77 million and $10.19 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 15.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This is primarily due to an increase in debit and credit card interchange fees of $1.52 million compared to 2020 with increased usage activity.
Other noninterest income decreased $0.61 million in 2021 primarily due to the net loss recognized on the tax credit real estate.
Noninterest Expenses
The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Total noninterest expenses were $81.34 and $75.63 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase is $5.71 million or 7.55% in 2021 and an increase of $8.37 million or 12.44% in 2020.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.84 million in 2021. The increase is primarily the result of annual salary adjustments.
Outside services increased $1.52 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increased debit and credit card processing charges with increase usage activity.
Other noninterest expenses increased $2.44 million in 2021 primarily due to $7.69 million in fees incurred from the prepayment of FHLB borrowings compared to $2.53 million of FHLB prepayment fees and $2.68 million of interest rate swap termination fees paid in 2020.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $14.01, $11.28 and $12.55 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were 22.56% in 2021, 22.59% in 2020 and 21.69% in 2019. The amount of tax credits were $0.48, $0.05 and $0.53 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Effects of Inflation
The consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company’s operations. Nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact in the Company’s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services. Liquidity and interest rate adjustments are features of the Company’s asset/liability management, which are important to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.
