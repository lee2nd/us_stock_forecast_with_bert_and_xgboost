Critical Accounting Estimates
Disclosure of Codorus Valley’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Some of these policies require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses.
Management considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews, financial and managerial strength of borrowers, adequacy of collateral, (if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows) and other relevant factors. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as a result of regulatory examinations.
Management discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related Management Discussion and Analysis disclosures with the Audit Committee. There were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report. Additional information is contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis regarding critical accounting estimates, including the provision and allowance for loan losses located on pages 31 and 44 of this report.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Executive Summary
The Corporation’s net income available to common shareholders (earnings) was $14,659,000 for the full year 2021, compared to $8,442,000 of earnings in 2020, an increase of $6,217,000 or 74 percent. The higher net income was primarily the result of lower provision for loan loss in 2021 compared to 2020, offset by higher noninterest expense. Lower interest income was offset by a decrease in interest expense.
Net interest income for 2021 increased $1,640,000 or 3 percent when compared to 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the rates on interest-bearing deposits, offset by lower rates on commercial loans.
Net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) for 2021 was 2.87 percent, compared to 3.13 percent for 2020. The Corporation continues to have success in growing lower cost core deposits in a highly competitive environment to offset the impact of lower market rates on commercial loans. The average yield on earning assets decreased to 3.31 percent in 2021 as compared to 3.92 percent in 2020 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.60 percent in 2021, as compared to 1.03 percent in 2020.
The loan loss provision for 2021 was $3,663,000, a decrease of $11,012,000 compared to 2020. The decreased provision expense in 2021 was primarily due to partial charge offs on commercial lending relationships in the prior year. Although some of the lending relationships did have specific reserve allocations to adequately cover the partial charge off, historical loss factors were negatively impacted, which increased the provision expense in the prior year. One partial charge off in the first quarter 2020 did not have a specific reserve allocation, which also increased provision expense in the prior year. Changes in the external environment created by COVID-19 continued to impact the qualitative factors for certain loan segments in the allowance for loan loss analysis, which resulted in additional provision for loan losses during the year. The provision for both periods supported adequate allowance for loan loss coverage, however, changing economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require future adjustments. The allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.49 percent at December 31, 2021, and 1.38 percent at December 31, 2020.
Noninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2021, totaled $16,388,000 representing an increase of $561,000 or 4 percent compared to noninterest income of $15,827,000 for 2020. All categories of noninterest income increased, except gain on sales of loans held for sale and loss on write down of assets held for sale. Loss on sales of investment securities totaled $23,000 for 2021 compared to gain on sales of investment securities of $65,000 in 2020.
Noninterest expense for the year ended 2021, totaled $56,215,000 representing an increase of $5,011,000 or 10 percent compared to $51,204,000 for 2020. Increases in personnel, professional and legal, marketing and external data processing were the primary factors.
The provision for income taxes for 2021 totaled $3,928,000 which was $1,897,000 or 93 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2020 of $2,031,000. The increase was due to higher income before taxes for 2021 compared to 2020.
Earnings per share were $1.51 basic and $1.50 diluted for 2021 compared to $0.86 basic and diluted for 2020. The increase in earnings per share for the year was primarily the result of the aforementioned higher net income in 2021.
On December 31, 2021, total assets were approximately $2.42 billion, representing a 12 percent increase compared to December 31, 2020. The growth for 2021 occurred primarily in cash and cash equivalents and securities which was funded primarily by an increase in deposits and offset by a reduction in long-term debt.
The Bank’s capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions.
The closing price for the Corporation’s common stock (NASDAQ: CVLY) was $21.52 per share on December 31, 2021, compared to $16.96 per share on December 31, 2020. Cash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2021 totaled $0.54 per share, representing an increase of $0.02 or 4 percent above the cash dividends of $0.52 paid for the year 2020.
Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2020
The full year 2021 net income available to shareholders of $14,659,000 represents an increase of $6,217,000 compared to the full year 2020 earnings of $8,442,000. Earnings per share were $1.51 basic and $1.50 diluted for 2021 compared to $0.86 basic and diluted for 2020. The higher net income was primarily the result of lower provision for loan loss in 2021 compared to 2020, offset by higher noninterest expense. Lower interest income was offset by a decrease in interest expense.
Net interest income, which totaled $62,100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, represented an increase of $1,640,000 or 3 percent above net interest income of $60,460,000 for 2020. The change in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the rate on commercial loans, offset by an increase in the volume of commercial loans and investment securities, combined with a decrease in the rate on time and interest-bearing deposits.
The loan loss provision for 2021 was $3,663,000, a decrease of $11,012,000 compared to a provision of $14,675,000 for 2020. The decreased provision expense in 2021 was primarily due to higher partial charge offs on commercial lending relationships in the prior year. Although some of the lending relationships did have specific reserve allocations to adequately cover the partial charge off, historical loss factors were negatively impacted which increased the provision expense in the prior year. One partial charge off in the first quarter 2020 did not have a specific reserve allocation, which also increased provision expense in the prior year. Changes in the external environment created by COVID-19 continued to impact the qualitative factors for certain loan segments in the allowance for loan loss analysis, which resulted in additional provision for loan losses during both periods. The provision for both periods supported adequate allowance for loan loss coverage considering several factors, including the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs, however, changing economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require future adjustments. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.49 percent and 1.38 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Noninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2021, totaled $16,388,000 representing an increase of $561,000 or 4 percent compared to noninterest income of $15,827,000 for 2020. All categories of noninterest income increased, except gain on sales of loans held for sale and loss on write down of assets held for sale. Loss on sales of investment securities totaled $23,000 for 2021 compared to gain on sales of investment securities of $65,000 in 2020.
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, totaled $56,215,000 representing an increase of $5,011,000 or 10 percent compared to $51,204,000 for 2020. Increases in personnel, professional and legal, marketing and external data processing were the primary factors.
The provision for income taxes for 2021 totaled $3,928,000 which was $1,897,000 or 93 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2020 of $2,031,000. The increase was due to higher income before taxes for 2021 compared to 2020.
On December 31, 2021, total assets were $2.42 billion, representing a 12 percent increase compared to total assets of $2.16 billion as of December 31, 2020. The growth for 2021 occurred primarily in cash and cash equivalents and securities which was funded primarily by an increase in deposits and offset by a reduction in long-term debt.
The growth in core deposits included a $107,709,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2021 compared to 2020. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.
Cash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2021 totaled $0.54 per share, representing an increase of $0.02 or 4 percent above the cash dividends of $0.52 paid for the year 2020.
The Bank’s capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 10 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.
INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS
Net Interest Income
The Corporation’s principal source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between (i) interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and (ii) interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in both interest rates, and the volume and composition of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Unless otherwise noted, this section discusses interest income and interest expense amounts as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which are not presented on a tax equivalent basis.
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $62,100,000, an increase of $1,640,000 or 3 percent above the full year 2020 net interest income. Although average earning assets increased by 12 percent, the average rate decreased by 61 basis points or 16 percent, driven by Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”) loans and an increase in interest bearing deposits with banks. The decrease in the rate of earning assets was partially offset by a reduction in the rate of interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin, which reflects net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, was 2.87 percent for 2021, compared to 3.13 percent for 2020.
Interest income for the full year 2021 totaled $71,691,000, a decrease of $4,022,000 or 5 percent below 2020. The decrease in total interest income was driven by lower rates on interest earning assets, partially offset by a higher average volume of interest earning assets. The decrease in rate and the increase in average balances were driven by PPP loans and an increase in interest bearing deposits with banks. Interest earning assets averaged $2.17 billion and yielded 3.31 percent (tax equivalent basis) for 2021, compared to $1.94 billion and a tax-equivalent yield of 3.92 percent, respectively, for 2020.
Interest expense for the full year 2021 totaled $9,591,000, a decrease of $5,662,000 or 37 percent below 2020. The decrease in total interest expense was primarily driven by a decrease in rate in core deposits (the Corporation defines core deposits as demand, savings, and money market deposits), time deposits and long-term borrowings. Interest expense on deposits decreased $6,316,000 or 47 percent for 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily attributed to the decreases in rates paid on interest bearing demand deposits and time deposits. The average volume of interest bearing core deposits was $1.01 billion for the full year 2021, a $163,349,000 or 19 percent increase above the average volume for 2020. Interest expense on long-term debt and subordinated debentures increased $650,000 or 39 percent for 2021. The average rate paid on long-term borrowings in 2021 of 2.48 percent, reflected a 6 basis point decrease from the average rate paid of 2.54 percent in 2020. Long-term debt is primarily comprised of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, with intermediate term bullet maturities that supplement deposit funding and provide a partial funding hedge against rising market interest rates and subordinated debentures issued in December 2020 by the Corporation.
Tables 1 and 2, following, are presented on a tax-equivalent basis to make it easier to compare taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest on tax-exempt assets (which include securities issued by, or loans made to, state and local governments) is adjusted based upon a 21 percent federal income tax rate in 2021 and 2020.
Table 1-Average Balances and Interest Rates (tax equivalent basis)
(1) Average balance includes average nonaccrual loans of $37,779,000 in 2021 and $22,475,000 in 2020. Interest includes net loan fees of $9,091,000 in 2021 and $6,128,000 in 2020.
(2) Average balance includes average bank owned life insurance, foreclosed real estate and unrealized holding gains (losses) on investment securities.
(3) Net interest income (tax equivalent basis) annualized as a percent of average interest earning assets.
Table 2-Rate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income (tax equivalent basis)
Changes which are due to both volume and rate are allocated in proportion to their relationship to the amount of change attributed directly to volume or rate.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses is an expense charged to earnings to cover estimated losses attributable to uncollectable loans. The provision reflects management's judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses. The Risk Management section of this report, including Table 11 - Nonperforming Assets and Table 11 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, provides detailed information about the allowance for loan losses, the loan loss provision, and credit risk.
For the year 2021, the provision for loan losses was $3,663,000, which was $11,012,000 or 75 percent lower, compared to a provision of $14,675,000 in 2020. The decreased provision expense in 2021 was primarily due to partial charge offs on commercial lending relationships in the prior year. Although some of the lending relationships did have specific reserve allocations to adequately cover the partial charge off, historical loss factors were negatively impacted which increased the provision expense in the prior year. One partial charge off in the first quarter 2020 did not have a specific reserve allocation, which also increased provision expense in the prior year. Changes in the external environment created by COVID-19 continued to impact the qualitative factors for certain loan segments in the allowance for loan loss analysis, which resulted in additional provision for loan losses during the prior year and to a lesser extent in the current year. The provision for both periods supported adequate allowance for loan loss coverage, however, changing economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require future adjustments.
Noninterest Income
The following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past two years.
Table 3 - Noninterest income
For the year 2021, the overall $473,000 or 3 percent increase in total noninterest income, compared to the year 2020, was primarily the result of modest increases in all categories except loss on assets held for sale, gain on sale of loans held for sale and loss on securities. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected categories of noninterest income.
Trust and investment services fees-The upward trend in trust and investment services fee income over the two year period presented was due to growth in trust assets under management from both new accounts, and appreciation in the market value of managed accounts, upon which some fees are based, offset by the departure of a large client relationship late 2021.
Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales- Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales increased due to higher volume of assets under management over the last two year period. The non-deposit investment products are sold by PeoplesBank’s subsidiaries Codorus Valley Financial Advisors, Inc. d/b/a PeoplesWealth Advisors.
Service charges on deposit accounts-For the year 2021, the $689,000 or 15 percent increase in service charge income compared to the year 2020 was due to a lower assessment of overdraft fees in the second quarter 2020. The lower assessment was partially due to the waiver of fees associated with the COVID-19 pandemic followed by an overall reduction in overdraft fees once fee assessment resumed. In addition, foreign ATM fees were waived during the second quarter 2020.
Income from bank owned life insurance (BOLI)-For the year 2021, the $212,000 or 19 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2020 was primarily due to additional investments made in the current year.
Other income-For the year 2021, the $312,000 or 19 percent increase in other income compared to the year 2020 was primarily the result of higher swap referral fees.
Loss on write down and sales of assets held for sale-For the year 2021, the Corporation recorded losses associated with assets held for sale, primarily related to the sale of the Dover Financial Center, compared to none in the prior year.
Net (loss) gain on sales of securities-For the year 2021, the Corporation realized $23,000 in loss on sales of securities compared to $65,000 in gains in 2020. Securities sold included those where market pricing for certain instruments provided a favorable total return upon the sales and reinvestment of proceeds, versus holding the respective securities to maturity.
Noninterest Expense
The following table presents the components of total noninterest expense for each of the past two years.
‎
Table 4 - Noninterest expense
Total noninterest expense for the year 2021 increased $5,011,000 or 10 percent above the year 2020. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected noninterest expenses.
Personnel-The $3,383,000 or 11 percent increase in personnel is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, including variable compensation and actual medical claims expense in 2021 compared to 2020.
Professional and legal-The $565,000 or 50 percent increase in professional and legal expense was attributable to increases in CPA and legal expenses.
Marketing- The $425,000 or 32 percent increase in marketing expense is primarily attributed to marketing campaigns resumed in 2021 following a delay in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
External data processing-The upward trend in external data processing from 2020 to 2021 reflects increased reliance on outsourcing transaction processing to specialized vendors, which is typically performed on their hosted and secure websites, thereby increasing the Corporation’s data processing efficiency. Additional expenditures related to expansion in the electronic banking services offered to our client base, new technology for loan origination to improve efficiency and accuracy, and charges for higher transaction volume from normal business growth.
Gain on foreclosed real estate including recovery of losses-The $170,000 or 100 percent decrease in foreclosed real estate including recovery of losses is attributed to the recovery of provision for loss associated with the sale of foreclosed real estate in 2020.
Impaired loan carrying costs-The $280,000 or 38 percent decrease in impaired loan carrying costs is attributable to the reduction in impaired loans.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for 2021 totaled $3,928,000, which was $1,897,000 or 93 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2020 of $2,031,000. The increase was due to higher net income before taxes in 2021 compared to 2020. For 2021 and 2020, the Corporation’s incremental statutory federal income tax rate was 21 percent; however, the Corporation’s effective income tax rate was approximately 21.3 percent for 2021, compared to 19.4 percent for 2020. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the impact of state income taxes, offset by the impact and volume of tax-exempt income, including income from bank owned life insurance and certain municipal securities and loans.
BALANCE SHEET REVIEW
Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks
Interest bearing deposits with banks totaled $525,644,000 on December 31, 2021, compared to $313,469,000 on December 31, 2020. The balance increased as a result of the strong growth in deposits offset by an increase in securities and a reduction in long-term debt.
Investment Securities (Available-for-Sale)
The Corporation’s entire investment securities portfolio is classified available-for-sale, and is comprised of interest-earning debt securities (see Table 5 below). Investment securities serve as an important source of liquidity, and provide stable interest income revenue supplementary to the larger loan portfolio. The securities also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and to support borrowing capacity. The investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the Corporation’s Investment Securities Policy, and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320. Decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, the demand for loans, liquidity and income requirements.
The following table shows the amortized cost and fair value, by type of debt security, for two year-end periods:
Table 5-Investment Securities
At December 31, 2021, the fair value of securities, available-for-sale, totaled $254,285,000, an increase compared to the fair value of the investment securities portfolio balance of $185,002,000 at December 31, 2020.
Securities available-for-sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments. On January 1, 2013, Section 939(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective changing the definition of investment grade by removing reliance on credit ratings by national statistical rating organizations. Investment credit assessment, under the revised definition, requires an active review by the Corporation (i.e., pre-purchase and post-purchase credit risk analysis) of the underlying obligor to determine that the obligor has an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments, and more specifically, that the risk of default is low, and that full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected. Obligations of the U.S. government and U.S. government sponsored enterprises are not subject to the due diligence requirement. However, the Corporation’s municipal and corporate securities are subject to the new requirement.
As shown in Table 5, above, the Corporation holds investments in the obligations of states and municipalities. Municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations, including decreasing costs and service levels, imposing taxes and fees and selling assets. In many cases, municipal debt issues are insured or, in the case of school districts of selected states, backed by specific reserves, which provide additional layers of protection to the investor. Access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities enabling a municipality to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost. For these reasons, defaults on municipal bonds are unusual. The majority of municipal bonds in the Corporation’s portfolio are general obligation bonds, which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue, including taxes, for payment. Only a few bonds are revenue bonds, which are dependent upon a single revenue stream for payment, but such bonds are for critical services such as water and sewer. Many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district loss reserves. Based on the results of an independent credit review of the Bank’s entire municipal bond portfolio as performed in 2021, and recent bond ratings by national statistical rating organizations, we believe that the municipal investments held by PeoplesBank are investment grade.
The table below shows that the available-for-sale securities portfolio had an overall yield of 2.05 percent on December 31, 2021:
Table 6-Securities Maturity Schedule (amortized cost basis)
(1) Weighted average yields (tax equivalent basis) were calculated on the amortized cost basis.
(2) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities are included in the maturity categories based on average expected life.
The portfolio yield as of December 31, 2021, reflected in the table above, is higher than the 1.92 percent securities portfolio yield as of December 31, 2020. Generally, higher yielding securities, as compared to the yields in maturing and called securities, were purchased in 2021. Yields in 2021 were also positively impacted due to a higher volume of repayments in 2020 which caused faster rates of premium amortization in 2020. Purchases included the reinvestment of cash flows from maturities, calls and principal repayments on mortgage-backed bonds, during a year of decreasing market investment interest rates. At year-end 2021 and 2020, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the US Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10 percent of shareholders’ equity. More information about investment securities is provided in Note 3-Securities, to the consolidated financial statements.
Restricted Investment in Bank Stocks
At December 31, 2021, the Corporation held approximately $1,311,000 in restricted common stock, compared to $2,593,000 at year-end 2020. Investment in restricted stock is a condition of obtaining credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP) and the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, which is a subsidiary of Atlantic Community Bancshares, Inc. (ACBI). Accordingly, changes in the level of restricted stock are the result of member capital requirements and borrowing levels from the FHLBP as described within the Long-term Debt section of this report. Of the total investment as of December 31, 2021, $1,236,000 consisted of stock issued by the FHLBP, with the remainder being restricted stock issued by ACBI. Information about restricted investment in bank stocks, including impairment considerations, is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
Loans Held for Sale
On December 31, 2021, loans held for sale were approximately $7,876,000, which consists of $2,518,000 residential mortgage loans and $5,358,000 of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans compared to $15,981,000 at year-end 2020 which consists of $7,389,000 residential mortgage loans and $8,592,000 of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. For both years, PeoplesBank’s mortgage banking production focused on originating and selling secondary-market qualifying residential mortgage loans.
Loans
On December 31, 2021, total loans, net of deferred fees, was approximately $1.53 billion, compared to $1.54 billion at year end 2020, a decrease of $14,894,000 or 1 percent below total loans as of year-end 2020. The decrease consisted of a decrease in commercial loans of $17,317,000 or 1 percent, a decrease in consumer loans of $2,939,000 or 3 percent, offset by an increase in mortgage loans of $8,197,000 or 9 percent. The decrease was attributed to the payoff
of PPP loans which had an outstanding balance of $24,973,000 at year end 2021, compared to $143,145,000 at year end 2020.
The average yield (tax-equivalent basis) earned on total loans was 4.35 percent for the full year 2021, as compared to 4.58 percent for the year 2020. Market interest rates and strong competition in our markets resulted in continuing pricing pressures on new loan and refinancing activities. The reduction in yields was further impacted by origination of PPP loans at 1.00%. The composition of the Corporation’s loan portfolio, by industry class, at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is provided in Note 4-Loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since that time banking regulators, the SEC and FASB have all issued additional guidance and clarification on various sections of the CARES Act. Section 4013 of the CARES Act provides the option to not apply ASC 310-40 (TDRs) to a loan modification, related specifically to COVID-19 hardships. Regulators have encouraged financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities and industries affected by COVID-19 using prudent and proactive actions which are in the best interests of the financial institution, the borrower and the economy. The Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a number of options for loan modifications, including interest deferral, full payment deferral, additional extensions of credit, and SBA loan programs (i.e., Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Paycheck Protection Program). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation has remaining loan modifications totaling $35,046,000 and $25,897,000, respectively. The Corporation has been an active participant in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, with outstanding PPP loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $24,973,000 and $143,145,000, respectively.
The following table presents the general composition of total loans for five year-end periods:
Table 7-Loan Portfolio Composition
The table below shows at December 31, 2021, the commercial loan portfolio was comprised of approximately $723,960,000 or 55 percent in fixed rate loans, and $584,379,000 or 45 percent in floating rate loans. This compares to $854,887,000 or 64 percent in fixed rate loans, and $472,996,000 or 36 percent in floating rate loans, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Floating rate loans reprice periodically with changes in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Prime Rate, or the Secured Overnight Financial Rate (SOFR).
Table 8-Selected Loan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity
During 2021, in terms of dollars and percentages more fixed rate commercial loans were originated, driven by PPP loan production, although a majority of the commercial portfolio is fixed rate loans with maturities ranging from five to ten years. Although the commercial loan portfolio’s fixed rate volume and longer maturities increase risk if interest rates rise, management has implemented interest rate risk mitigation strategies which include maintaining a shorter duration in the Corporation’s investment portfolio, and lengthening fixed rate liabilities, principally borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. In addition, commercial loans are generally structured whereby there is an initial fixed rate period, typically five years, and then adjustments based upon a predetermined index if a new fixed rate is not renegotiated. Approximately 41 percent of the loans identified as fixed interest rates above are set to adjust during the term of the loan. Additional loan information can be found in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and within the Risk Management section of this report.
Premises and Equipment
On December 31, 2021, premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $21,955,000, as compared to $25,206,000 on December 31, 2020. The decrease was a result of depreciation and disposals on existing premises and equipment of $4,631,000, offset by new purchases of premises and equipment of $2,032,000. The remaining change was the result of transfers to assets held for sale, net of disposition of a portion of those assets. Financing leases which are now included as part of premises and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets had a balance of $1,041,000 on December 31, 2021.
Other Assets
On December 31, 2021, other assets totaled $76,684,000, compared to $69,612,000 of other assets as of December 31, 2021. Other assets were primarily comprised of investments in bank owned life insurance (BOLI), prepaid expenses, accrued interest receivable, and deferred tax assets.
Investments in life insurance relates to a select group of employees and directors whereby PeoplesBank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. These investments, carried at the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, totaled $54,644,000 at year-end 2021, compared to $46,761,000 at year-end 2020. PeoplesBank purchased $7,007,000 of BOLI during 2021. The selection of the underlying BOLI insurers is based primarily on the respective insurers’ high credit rating and reputation, and competitive tax-exempt yield. The Corporation also seeks to maintain a reasonable diversification among insurers supporting the BOLI portfolio. The level of the Corporation’s BOLI investment was approximately 24 percent of PeoplesBank’s Tier 1 capital, excluding net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, at December 31, 2021, which is within the regulatory guideline of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital.
At year-end 2021 and year-end 2020, there were no foreclosed real estate assets included in other assets.
Also included with other assets is $4,562,000 of accrued interest receivable on loans and investment securities, and $6,355,000 of net deferred tax assets. Additional information about these assets can be found in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate subheadings.
Funding
Deposits
Deposits are the Corporation’s principal source of funding for earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.48 percent for the year 2021 as compared to 0.97 percent for the year 2020.
On December 31, 2021, deposits totaled $2.14 billion, which represented a $280,226,000 or 15 percent increase compared to the level at year-end 2020. The increase, primarily associated with noninterest and interest bearing demand, money market and savings, reflects new commercial client deposit relationships. Core deposits, consisting of demand, money market and savings, in aggregate, increased $350,798,000 or 26 percent and time deposits (i.e. CDs) decreased $70,572,000 or 13 percent. Of the total $461,715,000 of time deposits as of December 31, 2021, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of less than $100,000 totaled $283,910,000, $100,000 to $250,000 totaled $180,674,000 and $250,000 or more totaled $67,703,000. Time deposits totaling $287,629,000 or 62 percent of the total at year-end 2021 will mature in 2022.
On December 31, 2021, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of $100,000 and above was $214,317,000. Of this total, $42,551,000 mature within three months, $28,902,000 mature after three months but within six months, $63,997,000 mature after six months but within twelve months, and the remaining $78,867,000 mature beyond twelve months. The composition of the Corporation’s deposit portfolio at December 31, 2021 is provided in Note 7-Deposits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The table below reports an estimate of uninsured time deposits by maturity.
Table 9 - Uninsured Time Deposit Maturities
Short-term Borrowings
Short-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repo agreements), federal funds purchased, and other borrowings as described more fully in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2021, short-term borrowings totaled $10,761,000, as compared to the $8,540,000 as of December 31, 2020. The balance on December 31, 2021, consisted of $10,761,000 of repurchase agreements and no other short-term borrowings as compared to the balance of $8,540,000 at year-end 2020 consisting of repurchase agreements and no other short-term borrowings. The increase in the balance of repurchase agreements was a result of a shifting in balances out of deposit products while other short-term borrowings remained the same as cash flow from investments and deposits were ample to fund loan growth and maintain adequate liquidity.
Long-term Debt
Long-term debt is a secondary funding source to deposits for asset growth. On December 31, 2021, long-term debt totaled $52,262,000, compared to $77,208,000 at year-end 2021. The decrease was the result of the repayment of matured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP). Subordinated debentures issued by the Corporation in December, 2020 are included in long-term debt, totaling $30,683,000 and $30,602,000, respectively.
Generally, funds for the payment of long-term debt come from operations. On December 31, 2021, total unused credit with the FHLBP was approximately $562,388,000. Obligations to the FHLBP are secured by FHLBP stock and qualifying collateral, principally real estate secured loans. A listing of outstanding long-term debt obligations is provided in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Shareholders' Equity and Capital Adequacy
Shareholders' equity, or capital, enables the Corporation to maintain asset growth and absorb losses. Capital adequacy can be affected by a multitude of factors, including profitability, new stock issuances, corporate expansion, balance sheet growth, dividend policy, and regulatory mandates.
Total shareholders’ equity was $195,505,000 on December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $2,455,000 or 1 percent, compared to $197,960,000 at year-end 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of the Corporation’s $14,659,000 in net income available for shareholders less $5,270,000 of dividends paid to shareholders for 2021, $8,875,000 in treasury stock purchased during 2021 and a $3,731,000 other comprehensive loss. Information pertaining to stock of the Corporation is disclosed in Note 10-Shareholders’ Equity, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends on Stock
The Corporation typically pays cash dividends on its stock on a quarterly basis. The Board of Directors determines the dividend rate after considering the Corporation's capital requirements, current and projected net income, and other factors. Annual cash dividends per share for the year 2021 totaled $0.54 per share, representing an increase of $0.02 or 4 percent above the cash dividends of $0.52 paid for the year 2020.
Compensation Plans
As disclosed in this report, the Corporation maintains various employee and director benefit plans that could result in the issuance of its stock or affect its earnings. Information regarding these plans can be found in Note 11-Benefit Plans and Note 12-Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Capital Ratios
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2021, the Corporation and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.
Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At year-end 2021 and 2020, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized PeoplesBank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution’s category.
Table 10-Capital Ratios
(1) Net unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, net of taxes, are disregarded for capital ratio computation purposes in accordance with federal regulatory banking guidelines.
Risk Management
The Corporation’s Enterprise Risk Management Committee (“Committee”) meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and at least one independent director. The objective of the Committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the Corporation and its affiliates. While the Committee’s risk review is broad in scope, its primary responsibility is to develop, implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk represents the possibility that a loan client, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms, posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk. To support this objective, a lending policy framework has been established which management believes is sound given the nature and scope of our operations. This framework includes seven basic policy parameters that guide the lending process and minimize risk:
The Corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures.
Lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount, loan type, level of risk, and loan officer experience.
Loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the Board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre-established dollar thresholds and/or meet other criteria.
The Corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area, including York County and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Harford County, Baltimore County and Baltimore City, Maryland. Although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk, the diverse local economies and employee knowledge of our clients lessens this risk.
The loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single client or small group of related clients.
The Corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market, nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages.
The Corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein.
The Corporation uses loan-to-value ratios (“LTV ratios”) for loan underwriting, establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan, to minimize the risk of future loss from the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2021, the LTV ratios listed below were in effect.
An acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans, unless the lien has been taken as an abundance of caution. Generally, an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans. Exceptions to LTV ratios and the use of an approved licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the Board of Directors when there are compensating factors.
One component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations, defined as greater than 10 percent of the total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation had three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor, which represented 21.1 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor, which represented 14.8 percent of the portfolio and builder & developer, which represented 10.2 percent of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: residential real estate investor, which represented 15.4 percent of the portfolio and commercial real estate investor, which represented 15.3 percent of the portfolio. Loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate.
In addition to a comprehensive lending policy, numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year. These portfolios, or selected accounts therein, are also examined periodically by the Corporation’s or PeoplesBank’s regulators.
Nonperforming Assets
Table 11 - Nonperforming Assets, below, presents a two-year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios.
Table 11-Nonperforming Assets
For the year 2020 there was a $14,400,000 increase in nonperforming assets, primarily related to the identification of a likely deterioration within one credit relationship that had a loan balance of $12,500,000. For the year 2021 there was a $5,564,000 decrease in nonperforming assets, primarily related to a reduction in nonaccrual loans. The Corporation expanded its legal department in 2019 to include a part-time dedicated workout officer, who became full-time in 2020. The continuous collection efforts coordinated by the Corporation’s General Counsel, recoveries from borrower payments and foreclosed real estate sales, the establishment of valuation allowances for selective accounts, and if necessary, loan charge-offs have been critical to managing the level of nonperforming assets. Management believes that specific reserves assigned within the allowance for loan losses for each credit is sufficient at December 31, 2021. In monitoring and managing nonperforming assets, we remain concerned about the impact of changing economic conditions, the potential for adverse real estate market value changes, and the corresponding effects on commercial borrowers and changes in the external environment created by COVID-19.
Nonperforming assets are reviewed by management on a monthly basis and by the board of directors on a quarterly basis. We generally rely on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of real estate collateral for impaired collateral-dependent loans. Generally, an appraisal is performed when: (i) an account reaches 90 days past due, unless a certified appraisal was completed within the past twelve months; (ii) market values have changed significantly; (iii) the condition of the property has changed significantly; or (iv) the existing appraisal is outdated based upon regulatory or policy requirements. In instances where the value of the collateral is less than the net carrying amount of the loan, a specific loss allowance is established for the difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement. When it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected, that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance.
As of December 31, 2021, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance totaled $33,906,000, compared to $39,470,000 at year-end 2020. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. The Corporation generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income (i.e., recognizes interest income on a cash basis as long as the loan is sufficiently collateralized) when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due 90 days or more. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest represent loans that are contractually past due, but are well collateralized and in the process of collection. A loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured.
As of December 31, 2021, the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled $33,582,000, compared to $38,175,000 at year-end 2020. The decrease in nonaccrual loans resulted from principal repayments and charge-offs totaling $18,230,000, which was offset by loans totaling $13,637,000 being placed on nonaccrual status. For both periods, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance was comprised primarily of collateralized commercial loans. For 2021, the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans has been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately $2,634,000. The amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for 2021 was approximately $602,000. For 2020, the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately $3,497,000. The amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for 2020 was approximately $766,000.
Foreclosed real estate represents real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to PeoplesBank and is included in the Other Assets category on the Corporation’s balance sheet. There was no foreclosed real estate as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Troubled debt restructurings pertain to loans whose terms have been modified to include a concession that we would not ordinarily consider due to the debtor’s financial difficulties. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a reduction of interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, the deferral of payments or extension of the stated maturity date. Troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year, or if they cease to perform in accordance with the modified terms. As of December 31, 2021, the accruing troubled debt restructuring portfolio balance totaled $954,000, compared to $1,395,000 at year-end 2020. The decrease was the result of principal payments made on loans within the troubled debt restructuring portfolio as well as one loan relationship which paid off.
At December 31, 2021, there were modifications remaining for 2 mortgage loans totaling $1,700,000, 5 commercial loans totaling $33,300,000 and no consumer loans under the CARES Act, which are not considered TDRs. At December 31, 2020, there were modifications remaining for 8 mortgage loans totaling $3,800,000, 37 commercial loans totaling $85,400,000 and no consumer loans under the CARES Act, which are not considered TDRs.
At December 31, 2021, there were $47,845,000 in additional potential problem loans being closely monitored by management. These additional potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard, reflecting an increased risk of the borrowers’ ability to comply with present repayment terms. These loans are not classified as nonperforming and are not disclosed in Table 11. Comparatively, we were monitoring $41,839,000 of potential problem loans at December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Although the Corporation believes that it maintains sound credit policies, certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based upon management’s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis, which is subject to review and approval by the Board. An overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The allowance for loan losses consists primarily of two components: (i) specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans and (ii) allowances calculated for pools of loans. The Corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans. Loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics, and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history (two-year rolling average of net charge-offs) and qualitative factors, such as the results of internal and external credit reviews, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, adequacy of collateral, and general economic conditions. Determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is subjective, particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods, and requires that we make estimates using assumptions. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations.
A detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in Note 5 -Allowance for Loan Losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The allowance for loan losses was $22,782,000 or 1.49 percent of total loans, on December 31, 2021, compared to $21,264,000 or 1.38 percent on December 31, 2020. The $1,518,000 or 7 percent increase in the allowance from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was generally consistent with the increase to applicable qualitative factors in the calculation of the reserve to reflect changes in historical losses and COVID-19 and by an increase in the related allowance established for impaired loans of $746,000. Loan balances individually evaluated for impairment over the same 12 month period decreased by $5,035,000 and include those identified as nonaccrual or contractually past due.
Based on our comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, and recognizing other relevant considerations including expected continued loan growth, continued uncertainty on certain larger criticized assets as legal and collection efforts continue, and the unknown impact of future accounting and regulatory requirements related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2021, however, changing economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require future adjustments.
Table 12 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, below, presents a comparison of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for five year-end periods. While the Corporation attributes a portion of the allowance to individual loans and groups of loans that it evaluates and determines to be impaired, the allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the loan portfolio.
Table 12-Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses
Affecting our estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses are several considerations that are not specifically measureable through either specific loan impairment analyses, or portfolio-based historical losses. For example, we believe that we could face increasing credit risks and uncertainties, not yet reflected in current leading indicators, associated with prolonged low economic growth, or potential recessionary business conditions for certain industries or the broad economy, or the erosion of real estate values, any or all of which can adversely affect our borrowers’ ability to service their loans.
Additionally, we have experienced continued commercial loan growth, including growth in newer markets where we have less of a loss history. Also, we recognize the inherent imprecision in any methodology for estimating specific and general loan losses, including the unpredictable timing and amounts of charge-offs and related historical loss averages, and specific-credit or broader portfolio future cash flow value and collateral valuation uncertainties which could negatively impact unimpaired portfolio loss factors.
Liquidity
Maintaining adequate liquidity provides the Corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors, loan clients, employees, and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business. Additionally, it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise. Liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the Corporation's assets and liabilities. The primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows, funds received from client loan payments and, to a lesser degree, asset sales. The primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included in this report, present the changes in cash from operating, investing and financing activities. At year-end 2021, we believe our liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available-for-sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately $69,347,000 and available credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh totaling approximately $562,388,000. The Corporation’s loan-to-deposit ratio was approximately 71 and 83 percent as of year-end 2021 and 2020 respectively. The ratio decreased with period end deposit growth higher than loan growth in 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Corporation’s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans, unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities, and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are disclosed in Note 14-Commitments to Extend Credit, to the consolidated financial statements, and totaled $605,425,000 at December 31, 2021, compared to $591,362,000 at December 31, 2020. Generally, these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes. Accordingly, many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and, therefore, generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the Corporation or PeoplesBank.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents the amount and timing of payments due under long-term contractual obligations.
Table 13-Contractual Obligations
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation. The level of inflation can be measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers (December vs. December). The change in the CPI from 2020 to 2021 was 7.0 percent, compared to 1.3 percent from 2019 to 2020.
Management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the Corporation's ability to react to changes in market interest rates. Management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, management is focused on increasing fee income, an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
