CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Stock Based Compensation
We account for share-based compensation at fair value. Stock based compensation cost for stock options granted to employees, board members and service providers is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. During the year ended December 31, 2021 & 2020, no stock compensation was issued.
