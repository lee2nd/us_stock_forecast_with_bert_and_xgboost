Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
BUSINESS
Salisbury, a Connecticut corporation, formed in 1998, is the bank holding company for the Bank, a Connecticut-chartered and FDIC insured commercial bank headquartered in Lakeville, Connecticut. Salisbury's principal business consists of the business of the Bank. The Bank, formed in 1848, is engaged in customary banking activities, including general deposit taking and lending activities to both retail and commercial markets, and trust and wealth advisory services. The Bank conducts its banking business from fourteen full-service offices in the towns of: Canaan, Lakeville, Salisbury and Sharon, Connecticut; Great Barrington, South Egremont and Sheffield, Massachusetts; and, Fishkill, Newburgh, New Paltz, Poughkeepsie, Red Oaks Mill, Dover Plains and Millerton, New York, and its trust and wealth advisory services from offices in Lakeville, Connecticut.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements follow U.S. GAAP as applied to the banking industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event.
Salisbury’s significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which, along with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating Salisbury’s reported financial results, and they require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Management considers the policies related to the allowance for loan losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses charged to current earnings, is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. For purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses, the loan portfolio is segregated into pools of homogeneous loans in order to recognize differing risk characteristics among categories, and then further segregated by internal credit risk ratings. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events and current conditions. Adjustments to historical loss information are made to incorporate necessary qualitative adjustments to address factors that are not present in historical loss rates and are otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. A reserve is recorded upon origination or purchase of a loan. The allowance represents management’s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations. Note 1 describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the “Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Climate Change
There have been significant developments in federal and state legislation and regulation and international accords regarding climate change in recent years. Given our size and the nature of our business, the direct impact and expected future direct impact of climate-related regulation is not material to us, and is not expected to be material, to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Salisbury has not experienced any physical effects of climate change on our operations and results. We recognize that, while not material to our operations, indirect consequences of climate-related regulation may exist as a result of the impact such legislation may have on certain types of customers who engage in activity that could be deemed potentially harmful to the environment. Salisbury notes that the climate change landscape is constantly evolving and at this time, it is not possible for us to know or predict the full universe or extent that these indirect effects will have on the Company's future operations. At this time, Salisbury does not plan to have material future capital expenditures for climate-related projects. Additionally, we have not incurred material compliance costs related to climate change.
The following discussion and analysis of Salisbury's consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
COVID-19 has placed significant health and economic pressure on the communities the Bank serves, the State of Connecticut, the United States and other countries. In response, the Bank has proactively implemented several steps such as those set forth below to support the safety and well-being of its employees and customers, which procedures continue through the date of this Report:
· The Bank is practicing social distancing following the guidelines of the Center for Disease Control and requires many of its employees to work from home or from alternate locations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 25% of Salisbury’s employees worked from home or alternate locations.
· The Bank continues to leverage the drive-up windows in twelve of its fourteen branches as well as its electronic banking platform to continue to serve customers.
Salisbury will continue to monitor this pandemic as the situation continues to evolve and adjust its operating model accordingly.
Net Interest and Dividend Income
Net interest and dividend income (presented on a tax-equivalent basis) increased $2.5 million, or 6.4%, in 2021 over 2020. The net interest margin decreased 27 basis point to 3.01% in 2021 from 3.28% in 2020, mostly due to a 47 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets, partly offset by a 27 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin was affected by changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and funding liabilities, asset and liability growth, and the effects of changes in market interest rates on the pricing and re-pricing of assets and liabilities. Excluding PPP loans, the tax-equivalent net margin for 2021 was 2.87% compared with 3.28% for 2020. The following table sets forth the components of Salisbury's net interest income and yields on average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funds. Income and yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis.
(a) Includes non-accrual loans.
(b) Includes interest-bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold.
(c) Average balances of securities are based on amortized cost.
(d) Includes tax exempt income of $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively for 2021, 2020 and 2019 on tax-exempt securities and loans for which income and yields are calculated on a tax-equivalent basis.
(e) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
The following table sets forth the changes in net interest income (presented on a tax-equivalent basis) due to volume and rate.
Net interest and dividend income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans and securities and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings. The level of net interest income is a function of volume, rates and mix of both earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income can be affected by changes in interest rate levels, changes in the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to re-pricing within different future time periods, and in the level of non-performing assets.
Interest and Dividend Income
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income of $44.8 million in 2021 increased $0.7 million, or 1.5% in 2021. Loan income increased $282 thousand, or 0.7%, to $41.5 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $39.7 million, or 3.9%, increase in average loans, which was partly offset by a 13 basis point decrease in average yield.
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income from securities increased $428 thousand, or 16.7%, to $3.0 million in 2021, as a result of a $55.2 million, or 61.9%, increase in average security balances, partly offset by an 80 basis point decrease in average yield. Interest from short term funds increased $56 thousand, or 36.4%, to $210 thousand in 2021, as a result of a $93.0 million, or 141.0%, increase in average short term balances, partly offset by a 10 basis point decrease in average yield.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $1.8 million, or 34.8%, to $3.4 million in 2021. Interest expense on interest bearing deposit accounts decreased $1.7 million, or 44.4%, to $2.2 million in 2021, as a result of a 27 basis point decrease in the average rate to 0.24%, partly offset by a $126.4 million, or 16.6%, increase in average interest bearing deposit balances. Interest expense on money market accounts decreased $598 thousand, or 52.2%, due to a 28 basis point decline in the average rate, partly offset by a $59.1 million, or 23.0% increase in average balances. Interest expense on savings and other accounts decreased $225 thousand, or 48.5%, due to a 15 basis point decline in the average rate, partially offset by a $40.1 million, or 22.9%, increase in average balances. Interest expense on certificates of deposits decreased $901 thousand, or 49.0%, due to 55 basis point decline in the average rate and a $13.6 million, or 9.4% decrease in average balance.
Interest expense on FHLBB advances decreased $480 thousand, or 79.3%, to $125 thousand in 2021, due to a $30.2 million, or 75.2%, decrease in average advances and a 25 basis point decrease in the average borrowing rate to 1.24%.
Interest expense on subordinated debt increased $382 thousand, or 61.8% to $1.0 million in 2021, due to a $12.6 million, or 128.1% increase in average balances, partly offset by a decrease in the average borrowing rate to 4.44%. In March 2021, Salisbury issued $25.0 million of fixed to floating rate subordinated debentures at an initial coupon rate of 3.50%. The proceeds from the issuance were used in part to fully redeem the $10 million of its outstanding subordinated debt issued in 2015 at a rate of 6.00%.
Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses
Net credit reserves of $0.7 million were released in 2021 compared with a provision for loan losses of $5.0 million for 2020. Net loan charge-offs were $72 thousand and $179 thousand, for the respective years. The net release of credit reserves in 2021 primarily reflected the transfer of loans in the discrete COVID-19 pool, which carries a higher level of reserves, back to their pre-pandemic loan pool because the borrowers were paying as agreed and the underlying businesses were substantially operating at pre-pandemic levels. The pay-off of certain commercial loans and internal risk rating changes also contributed to the release of credit reserves, which was substantially offset by loan growth and changes to qualitative factors due to continued uncertainty over the economic impact of COVID-19 and other macro-economic factors. Management will continue to monitor the impact of the virus and other macro-economic factors on its borrowers and adjust the allowance as appropriate. A resurgence of the virus that results in another economic lockdown or an economic slowdown due to rising interest rates, inflation or labor shortages may result in an increase in Salisbury’s provision and allowance for loan losses.
The following table sets forth changes in the allowance for loan losses and other statistical data:
The reserve coverage at December 31, 2021, as measured by the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans, was 1.20%, as compared with 1.32% at December 31, 2020. Excluding loans advanced under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, the ratio of the allowance to gross loans was 1.23% at December 31, 2021 compared with 1.44% at December 31, 2020. Non-performing loans (non-accrual loans and accruing loans past-due 90 days or more) decreased $1.4 million to $4.2 million, or 0.39% of gross loans receivable, at December 31, 2021, down from $5.6 million or 0.54% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days decreased from $6.8 million, or 0.66%, of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020 to $1.3 million, or 0.12%, of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2021. See “Overview - Loan Credit Quality” below for further discussion and analysis.
Non-Interest Income
The following table details the principal categories of non-interest income.
Non-interest income increased $1.2 million, or 11.4%, in 2021 versus 2020. Trust and Wealth Advisory revenues increased $776 thousand mainly due to growth in asset-based fees. Service charges and fees increased $1.8 million from 2020. The increase primarily reflected higher deposit, interchange and loan prepayment fees. In addition, during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, Salisbury waived approximately $754 thousand in various deposit fees, including overdraft and ATM fees, to support customers affected by COVID-19. Mortgage banking activities, net decreased $621 thousand on lower sales volume. Mortgage loan sales to FHLBB totaled $34.6 million in 2021 versus $59.8 million in 2020. Loans serviced under the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program totaled $140.7 million and $134.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. The twelve month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included mortgage servicing amortization of $235 thousand and $151 thousand, respectively. In 2020, the Bank recorded a non-taxable gain of $601 thousand related to proceeds received from a BOLI policy due to the death of a covered former employee. Non-interest income for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021 also included a pre-tax gain of $73 thousand primarily from the sale of Salisbury’s operations center in Canaan, Connecticut. Other income primarily includes rental property income.
Non-Interest Expense
The following table details the principal categories of non-interest expense.
Non-interest expenses increased $3.1 million, or 10.6%, in 2021 versus 2020. Salaries increased $1.6 million primarily reflecting annual merit increases and higher production and incentive accruals. Benefits increased $490 thousand compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due higher medical insurance costs, 401K accruals and payroll taxes. Premises and equipment increased $95 thousand mainly due to higher building depreciation and facilities related expenses. The twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 also included a pre-tax loss of $144 thousand on the sale of the building housing the Bank’s branch in Poughkeepsie, New York, which closed during the first quarter 2022. Data processing increased $230 thousand mainly due to higher ATM fees, core system costs and Trust and Wealth data related expenses. The increase in professional fees of $38 thousand versus the twelve month period 2020 primarily reflected higher legal, audit and exam and investment management expenses partially offset by lower consulting expense. Collections, OREO and loan related expense increased $132 thousand primarily due to higher appraisal and mortgage recording costs. FDIC related expense increased $75 thousand compared to the same period in 2020 reflecting higher deposit balances. Marketing and community support costs increased $308 thousand compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to Salisbury’s web site redesign and branding initiatives as well as costs associated with various marketing events. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $65 thousand due to the aging off of expenses related to previous acquisitions. Other expenses increased $30 thousand and primarily reflected higher employee related expenses, postage and telephone expense.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 20.6% and 17.0%, respectively. Salisbury’s effective tax rate was less than the 21% federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, primarily from municipal bonds, tax advantaged loans and bank-owned life insurance. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate generally result from changes in the mix of taxable and tax-exempt income. For further information on income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Salisbury did not incur Connecticut income tax in 2021, 2020 or 2019, other than minimum state income tax, as a result of a Connecticut law that permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the Connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a special purpose entity called a Passive Investment Company or PIC. Salisbury avails itself of this benefit through its PIC, SBT Mortgage Service Corporation. Salisbury's income tax provision reflects the full impact of the Connecticut legislation. Salisbury does not expect to pay other than minimum Connecticut state income tax in the foreseeable future unless there is a change in Connecticut tax law.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net Interest and Dividend Income
Net interest and dividend income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans and securities and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings. The level of net interest income is a function of volume, rates and mix of both earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income can be affected by changes in interest rate levels, changes in the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to re-pricing within different future time periods, and in the level of non-performing assets.
Interest and Dividend Income
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income of $44.1 million in 2020 was essentially unchanged from 2019. Loan income increased $1.1 million, or 2.7%, to $41.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $97.1 million, or 10.5%, increase in average loans, which was partly offset by a 33 basis point decrease in average yield.
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income from securities decreased $377 thousand, or 12.8%, to $2.6 million in 2020, as a result of a $6.5 million, or 6.8%, decrease in average security balances, and a 20 basis point decrease in average yield. Interest from short term funds decreased $521 thousand in 2020 as a result of a 164 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a $29.8 million, or 82.6%, increase in average short term balances.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $4.0 million, or 75.9%, to $5.3 million in 2020. Interest expense on interest bearing deposit accounts decreased $3.4 million, or 46.9%, to $3.9 million in 2020, as a result of a $47.5 million, or 6.7%, increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a 52 basis point decrease in the average rate to 0.51%. Interest expense on money market accounts decreased $1.2 million, or 50.9%, due to a 60 basis point decline in the average rate partly offset by a $34.3 million, or 15.4% increase in average balance. Interest expense on savings and other accounts decreased $1.1 million, or 69.4%, due to a 61 basis point decline in the average rate. Interest expense on certificates of deposits decreased $1.0 million, or 35.9%, due to 53 basis point decline in the average rate and a $15.3 million, or 9.6% decrease in average balance. The decrease in the average certificate of deposit balance from 2019 reflected a $12.5 million decrease in average one-way buys executed through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). CDARS is a product offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network that enables participating financial institutions to buy or sell excess funds to other members to fund operations and to manage liquidity.
Interest expense on FHLBB advances decreased $538 thousand, or 47.1%, due to a 149 basis point decrease in the average borrowing rate to 1.49%, partly offset by a $1.8 million, or 4.7%, increase in average advances.
In December 2015, Salisbury issued $10 million of subordinated debentures. The proceeds of such issuance, along with cash-on-hand, were used by Salisbury to fully redeem $16 million of its outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, which was issued pursuant to the participation in the U.S. Treasury’s SBLF program. Interest expense on the subordinated debt for 2020 and 2019 was $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses was $5.0 million for 2020, compared with $1.0 million for 2019. Net loan charge-offs were $0.2 million and $0.6 million, for the respective years. The higher provision for loan losses in 2020 primarily reflected management’s assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on certain qualitative and environmental factors and impaired loans as well as loan growth. Management will continue to monitor the impact of the virus on its borrowers and adjust the allowance as appropriate. The length of time required for the economy to substantially recover from the virus will have a direct impact on Salisbury’s provision and allowance for loan losses. A longer recovery or another forced shutdown that leads to sustained levels of unemployment will likely result in an increase in Salisbury’s provision and allowance for loan losses.
The reserve coverage at December 31, 2020, as measured by the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans, was 1.32%, as compared with 0.95% at December 31, 2019. Excluding loans advanced under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, the ratio of the allowance to gross loans was 1.44% at December 31, 2020. Non-performing loans (non-accrual loans and accruing loans past-due 90 days or more) increased $2.0 million to $5.6 million, or 0.54% of gross loans receivable, at December 31, 2020, up from $3.6 million or 0.39% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The increase in non-performing loans from the prior year end primarily reflected loans of $3.7 million placed on non-accrual status partly offset by loan sales of $0.7 million, loan payments of $0.5 million and loans returned to accruing status of $0.5 million. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days increased from $2.1 million, or 0.22%, of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019 to $6.8 million, or 0.66%, of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020. The increase included loans of $3.0 million that matured in fourth quarter 2020, most of which are expected to renew in first quarter 2021. See “Overview - Loan Credit Quality” below for further discussion and analysis.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income increased $1.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2020 versus 2019. Trust and Wealth Advisory revenues increased $199 thousand mainly due to growth in asset-based fees. Service charges and fees decreased $956 thousand from 2019. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, Salisbury waived approximately $754 thousand in various deposit fees, including overdraft and ATM fees, to support customers affected by COVID-19. These fees were reinstituted in late November 2020. Mortgage banking activities, net increased $1.2 million on higher sales volume. Mortgage loan sales totaled $59.8 million in 2020 versus $6.4 million in 2019. Loans serviced under the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program totaled $134.4 million and $106.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the Bank recorded a non-taxable gain of $601 thousand related to proceeds received from a BOLI policy due to the death of a covered former employee. Other income primarily includes rental property income.
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expenses increased $126 thousand, or 0.4%, in 2020 versus 2019. Salaries decreased $220 thousand as higher production and incentive accruals as well as higher overtime costs were more than offset by an increase in deferred compensation costs associated with originating loans, including PPP loans. Benefits increased $149 thousand compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a one-time reduction of $328 thousand received in the fourth quarter 2019 due to the modification of key terms of agreements related to BOLI policies and higher accruals for performance based restricted stock units, partly offset by lower expenses for phantom stock appreciation units. See Note 16 for a further discussion of Salisbury’s Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans. Premises and equipment increased $3 thousand mainly due to increased software expense partially offset by lower depreciation, building maintenance and utilities costs. Data processing increased $10 thousand mainly due to ATM fees and core data processing costs partially offset by lower Trust and Wealth data processing expense. The increase in professional fees of $528 thousand versus the twelve month period 2019 primarily reflected higher consulting and investment management expenses, partly offset by lower legal costs. Collections, OREO and loan related expense decreased $113 thousand due to OREO losses in the twelve month period 2019. The increase in FDIC insurance expense primarily reflected non-recurring assessment credits of $240 thousand received in 2019. Marketing and community support costs decreased $46 thousand compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower marketing expenditures partially offset by increased contributions. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $67 thousand due to the aging off of expenses related to previous acquisitions. Other expenses increased $85 thousand and primarily reflected accruals related to litigation matters occurring in the normal course of business.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 17.0% and 17.5%, respectively. Salisbury’s effective tax rate was less than the 21% federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, primarily from municipal bonds, tax advantaged loans and bank-owned life insurance. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate generally result from changes in the mix of taxable and tax-exempt income. For further information on income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Salisbury did not incur Connecticut income tax in 2020, 2019 or 2018, other than minimum state income tax, as a result of a Connecticut law that permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the Connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a special purpose entity called a Passive Investment Company or PIC. Salisbury avails itself of this benefit through its PIC, SBT Mortgage Service Corporation. Salisbury's income tax provision reflects the full impact of the Connecticut legislation. Salisbury does not expect to pay other than minimum Connecticut state income tax in the foreseeable future unless there is a change in Connecticut tax law.
Overview
Assets
During 2021, Salisbury’s assets increased by $235.5 million, or 18.2%, to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase in assets was driven by the continued robust growth in deposit balances during 2021. Salisbury actively deployed these deposits into loans and investments to generate additional interest income. Net loan growth of $39.0 million, or 3.8%, in 2021, reflected a net reduction in Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan balances of $61.0 million due to the forgiveness of said loans by the SBA. Excluding PPP loans, net loans increased by $100.0 million, or 10.6%, in 2021. Balances in the securities portfolio, which is discussed below, increased $103.7 million, or 102.6%, from December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, Salisbury’s tangible book value and book value per common share were $42.76 and $47.73, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.42% and 14.08%, respectively, and the Bank was categorized as "well capitalized" according to regulatory guidelines.
Securities and Short-Term Funds
During 2021, securities increased $103.7 million to $204.7 million, while short-term funds (cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with other banks) increased $82.1 million to $175.3 million. The carrying values of securities are as follows:
Salisbury evaluates securities for OTTI where the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. As part of this process, Salisbury considers whether it has the intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, Salisbury recognizes an OTTI charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For securities that meet neither of these conditions, an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for OTTI.
Salisbury evaluates securities for strategic fit and may reduce its position in securities, although it is not more likely than not that Salisbury will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis, which may be maturity, and does not intend to sell these securities. Management does not consider any of its securities to be OTTI at December 31, 2021. It is possible that future loss assumptions could change necessitating Salisbury to recognize future OTTI. Salisbury evaluates securities for strategic fit and may reduce its position in securities, although it is not more likely than not that Salisbury will be required to sell securities before recovery of their cost basis, which may be maturity.
Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2021 included net unrealized holding gains, net of tax, of $0.9 million, which is a decrease of $2.1 million from December 31, 2020. The net decline in unrealized gains reflected the increase in market interest rates experienced in 2021 compared with 2020.
Loans
During 2021, net loans receivable increased $39.1 million, or 4%, to $1.067 billion at December 31, 2021. Excluding PPP loans, net loans increased by $100.0 million, or 10.6%, in 2021. Salisbury’s retail lending department originates residential mortgage, home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans for the portfolio. During 2021, Salisbury originated a record $165.9 million of residential mortgage loans and $11.8 million of home equity loans for the portfolio, compared with $147.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in 2020. During 2021, total residential mortgage and home equity loans receivable increased $42.8 million to $468.5 million at December 31, 2021, and represented 43.4% of gross loans receivable. During 2021, Salisbury’s residential mortgage lending department also originated and sold $34.6 million of residential mortgage loans, compared with $59.8 million during 2020. All such sold loans were sold through the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program with servicing retained by Salisbury. Consumer loans, amounted to $12.5 million at December 31, 2021, representing 1.2% of gross loans receivable.
Salisbury’s commercial lending department specializes in lending to small and mid-size companies, businesses and municipalities. More specifically, we meet our clients’ credit needs by providing short-term and long-term financing, construction loans, commercial mortgages, equipment, working capital, property improvement loans and municipal financing. The department also works with both the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Government Guaranteed Lending Programs; however, such loans represent a very small percent of the commercial loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, total commercial loans, which include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and municipal loans, increased $51.3 million to $555.8 million at December 31, 2021, and represent 51.5% of gross loans receivable. Commercial real estate loan balances at December 31, 2021 were reduced by $10.2 million due to the pay-off of two hotel loans in fourth quarter 2021. At December 31, 2021 approximately $26 million of PPP loans remained on Salisbury’s balance sheet. These loans are reported as a separate component of “commercial and industrial” loans in the table below.
The principal categories of loans receivable and loans held-for-sale are as follows:
The composition of loans receivable by forecasted maturity distribution is as follows:
The composition of loans receivable with either fixed, variable or adjustable interest rates is as follows:
Loan Credit Quality
Salisbury has cooperative relationships with the vast majority of its non-performing loan customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral. Salisbury pursues the resolution of all non-performing loans through collections, restructures, voluntary liquidation of collateral by the borrower and, where necessary, legal action. When attempts to work with a customer to return a loan to performing status, including restructuring the loan, are unsuccessful, Salisbury will initiate appropriate legal action seeking to acquire property by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure, or to liquidate business assets.
On March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus”, this guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of the virus. The guidance goes on to explain that the federal banking agencies conclude that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of the relief program are not Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”). Section 4013 of the CARES Act addresses modifications resulting from the pandemic and specified that virus related modifications on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. The Bank has applied Section 4013 guidance and implemented a loan payment deferral program which allows residential, commercial and consumer borrowers, who have been adversely affected by the virus and whose loans were not more than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019, to defer loan payments for up to three months. Borrowers may apply to the Bank for additional deferments, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding commercial, residential or consumer loan payment deferrals.
The CARES Act provides emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the virus. The CARES Act authorized the SBA to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program. As a qualified SBA lender, the Bank was automatically qualified to originate loans under the PPP. In 2020, Salisbury processed 932 PPP loans for a principal balance of approximately $100 million primarily for existing customers. The expected forgiveness amount is the amount of loan principal the lender reasonably expects the borrower to spend on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent and utilities during the covered period after the loans are funded. On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (“PPPFA”) was signed into law. The PPPFA increased the covered period from eight weeks to twenty-four weeks, reduced the portion of the loan that must be spent on payroll costs from 75% to 60% and extended the term of loans that are not forgiven from two years to five years. For PPP loans originated prior to June 5, 2020, borrowers and lenders may mutually agree to increase the loan term to five years. The vast majority of PPP loans processed by Salisbury have a two-year term. Management funded these short-term loans through a combination of deposits, short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, and brokered deposits. Salisbury did not participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”).
On December 27, 2020 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. Certain provisions of the CARES Act were modified and extended by the Act. One of the features of the Act was the provision of $284 billion in additional funding for the PPP program, including a Second draw Paycheck Protection Program for qualifying businesses for which there was a quarterly revenue reduction of at least 25% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Salisbury processed 473 PPP loans for a principal balance of approximately $48 million under this additional PPP program, which began in January 2021 and ended in May 2021. The Bank funded these loans through deposits. At December 31, 2021, Salisbury had approximately $26 million of PPP loans on its balance sheet.
Past Due Loans
Loans past due 30 days or more decreased $7.3 million during 2021 to $2.6 million, or 0.24% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2021, compared with $9.9 million, or 0.95% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020. The decrease included approximately $3.0 million of loans that matured during fourth quarter 2020 and were renewed in 2021.
The components of loans past due 30 days or greater are as follows:
Credit Quality Segments
Salisbury categorizes loans receivable into the following credit quality segments.
· Impaired loans consist of all non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans, and represent loans for which it is probable that Salisbury will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements.
· Non-accrual loans, a sub-set of impaired loans, are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued because, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is unlikely.
· Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans, and accruing loans past due 90 days and over that are well collateralized, in the process of collection and where full collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans plus real estate acquired in settlement of loans.
· Troubled debt restructured loans are loans for which concessions such as reduction of interest rates, other than normal market rate adjustments, or deferral of principal or interest payments, extension of maturity dates, or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest, have been granted due to a borrower’s financial condition. Loan restructuring is employed when management believes the granting of a concession will increase the probability of the full or partial collection of principal and interest.
· Potential problem loans consist of performing loans that have been assigned a substandard credit risk rating and are not classified as impaired.
Non-Performing Assets
Non-performing assets decreased $1.4 million to $4.2 million at December 31, 2021, or 0.27% of assets, from $5.6 million or 0.44% of assets at December 31, 2020. The decrease from the prior year end was attributed to loan sales, loan pay-off’s and loan payments, partially offset by the classification of additional loans as non-performing.
The components of non-performing assets are as follows:
Reductions in interest income associated with non-accrual loans are as follows:
The past due status of non-performing loans is as follows:
At December 31, 2021, 69.02% of non-performing loans were current with respect to loan payments, compared with 45.06% at December 31, 2020. Loans past due 180 days and over are substantially all mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure or litigation.
Salisbury endeavors to work constructively to resolve its non-performing loan issues with customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral.
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Troubled debt restructured loans decreased $2.8 million in 2021 to $5.0 million, or 0.46% of gross loans receivable, from $7.8 million, or 0.75% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020. The decrease from the prior year end was attributed to loan sales, pay-off’s, refinancing and payment activity, partially offset by the classification of an additional loan as a trouble debt restructured loan. The components of troubled debt restructured loans are as follows:
The past due status of troubled debt restructured loans is as follows:
At December 31, 2021, 79.73% of troubled debt restructured loans were current with respect to loan payments, as compared with 76.41% at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were specific reserves on troubled debt restructured loans amounting to $31 thousand, $397 thousand, and $582 thousand, respectively.
Potential Problem Loans
Potential problem loans consist of performing loans that have been assigned a substandard credit risk rating and are not classified as impaired. Potential problem loans increased $6.8 million during 2021 to $25.0 million, or 2.32% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2021, compared with $18.2 million, or 1.75% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020. The increase primarily reflected internal credit risk rating downgrades on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans to businesses in the hospitality, health care and entertainment and recreation industries due to concerns over the impact of COVID-19. The components of potential problem loans were as follows:
The past due status of potential problem loans was as follows:
At December 31, 2021, 99.84% of potential problem loans were current with respect to loan payments, as compared with 96.70% at December 31, 2020. Management cannot predict the extent to which economic or other factors may impact such borrowers’ future payment capacity, and there can be no assurance that such loans will not be placed on nonaccrual status, restructured, or require increased provisions for loan losses.
Deposits and Borrowings
Deposits increased $207.1 million, or 18.3%, during 2021, to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in deposits primarily reflected the funding of PPP loans, government stimulus payments to customers and normal business activity. Retail repurchase agreements increased $4.3 million, or 60.6%, to $11.4 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $7.1 million at December 31, 2020.
The distribution of average total deposits by account type was as follows:
The classification of certificates of deposit by interest rates was as follows:
The distribution of certificates of deposit by interest rate and maturity was as follows:
Scheduled maturities of time certificates of deposit in denominations of $100 thousand or more were as follows:
FHLBB advances decreased $4.9 million during 2021 to $7.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $12.6 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflected maturities and principal payments on amortizing advances. Salisbury also has an Irrevocable Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement with the FHLBB, whereby upon the Bank’s request an irrevocable letter of credit is issued to secure municipal and certain other transactional deposit accounts. These letters of credit are secured primarily by residential mortgage loans. The amount of funds available from the FHLBB to the Bank is reduced by any letters of credit outstanding. At year end 2021 and 2020, Salisbury had $20.0 million of outstanding letters of credit with FHLBB. At December 31, 2021, Salisbury’s excess borrowing capacity at the FHLBB was $250.9 million compared with $255.5 million at December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth certain information concerning short-term FHLBB advances:
Subordinated Debentures
In March 2021, Salisbury completed the issuance of $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes Due 2031 (the “Notes”) in a private placement transaction to various accredited investors. The Notes have a maturity date of March 31, 2031 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.50% per annum, from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding March 31, 2026 or the earlier redemption date, payable quarterly in arrears. From and including March 31, 2026 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption date, a floating per annum rate expected to be equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 280 basis points, provided, however, that in the event three-month SOFR is less than zero, three-month term SOFR shall be deemed to be zero, payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on the Subordinated Notes will be payable on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year to, but excluding, March 31, 2026 or the earlier redemption date, at the rate of 3.50%, and quarterly thereafter on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption date at the floating rate. The first interest payment was made on June 30, 2021. The notes are redeemable, without penalty, on or after March 31, 2026 and, in certain limited circumstances, prior to that date. As more completely described in the Notes, the indebtedness as evidenced by the Notes, including principal and interest, is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of the Company’s payments to general and secured creditors and depositors of the Bank. The Notes also contain provisions with respect to redemption features and other matters pertaining to the Notes. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, subject to applicable limitations. As a result of the Notes being within five (5) years of their maturity date, Tier 2 capital at the parent company only will decrease in an amount equal to 20.0% of the outstanding Notes per year until the Notes mature in 2031 or are earlier redeemed.
Subordinated debentures totaled $24.5 million at December 31, 2021, which includes $526 thousand of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are being amortized to maturity. The effective interest rate of the subordinated debentures is 3.73%. In May 2021, Salisbury redeemed in-full the subordinated debt issued in 2015.
MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS
In the normal course of business, Salisbury enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2021 include operating leases, capital leases, contractual purchases and certain other benefit plans. For further discussion regarding leases see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The accompanying table summarizes Salisbury’s off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and significant cash obligations, by remaining maturity, at December 31, 2021. Salisbury’s lending-related financial instruments include commitments that have maturities over one year. Contractual purchases include commitments for future cash expenditures, primarily for services and contracts that reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. Excluded from the following table are a number of obligations to be settled in cash, primarily in under one year. These obligations are reflected in Salisbury’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and include deposits, FHLBB advances and repurchase agreements that settle within standard market timeframes.
LIQUIDITY
Salisbury manages its liquidity position to ensure it has sufficient funding availability at all times to meet both anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals, loan originations and advances, securities purchases and other operating cash outflows. Salisbury’s primary source of liquidity is deposits and though its preferred funding strategy is to attract and retain low cost deposits, its ability to do so is affected by competitive interest rates and terms in its marketplace, and other financial market conditions. Other sources of funding include cash flows from loan and securities principal payments and maturities, funds provided by operations, and discretionary use of national market certificates of deposit and FHLBB advances. Liquidity can also be provided through sales of securities and loans. Salisbury manages its liquidity in accordance with a liquidity funding policy, and also maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity. Management believes Salisbury’s funding sources will meet anticipated funding needs.
Operating activities for 2021 provided net cash of $18.1 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $153.2 million, principally from purchases of securities of $145.3 million, net loan originations and principal collections of $37.8 million, an investment of $6.0 million in BOLI and capital expenditures of $2.3 million, offset by sales, calls, and maturities of securities of $37.5 million, proceeds from sale of assets of $0.2, proceeds from the redemption of FHLBB stock of $0.3 million and other activity of $0.2 million. Financing activities provided net cash of $217.3 million, principally from a net increase in deposits of $207.1 million, net proceeds of $24.4 million from the issuance of subordinated debt, an increase of $4.3 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, partly offset by the redemption of $10.0 million of subordinated debt issued by Salisbury in 2015, payments of $5.0 million on FHLBB advances, common stock dividends of $3.5 million and other activity of $0.1 million.
Operating activities for 2020 provided net cash of $13.8 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $114.0 million, principally from purchases of securities of $37.4 million, net loan originations and principal collections of $107.4 million, a $3.5 million investment in BOLI and capital expenditures of $4.4 million, offset by sales, calls, and maturities of securities of $32.5 million, BOLI proceeds of $4.0 million and proceeds from the redemption of FHLBB stock of $1.5 million. Financing activities provided net cash of $166.5 million, principally from a net deposit increase of $209.5 million and advances from FHLBB for $16.0 million, partly offset by FHLBB advances payments of $54.3 million, and common stock dividends of $3.3 million, and a decrease of $1.4 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Operating activities for 2019 provided net cash of $14.3 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $23.4 million, principally from purchases of securities of $53.5 million, loan originations and principal collections, net of $19.2 million, a $5.8 million investment in BOLI and capital expenditures of $2.0 million, offset by sales, calls, and maturities of securities of $55.4 million. Financing activities utilized net cash of $22.5 million, principally from the maturity of FHLBB advances of $37.0 million, a net deposit decrease of $7.2 million, and common stock dividends of $3.2 million, partly offset by FHLBB advances of $20.5 million and an increase of $4.4 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity increased $11.8 million, or 9.5%, in 2021 to $136.6 million at December 31, 2021. Contributing to the increase in shareholders’ equity was net income of $16.5 million, restricted stock awards of $0.9 million to certain of Salisbury’s directors and employees, partially offset by common stock dividends declared of $3.5 million and a reduction of other comprehensive income of $2.1 million.
Capital Requirements
The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Under current regulatory definitions, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and the Bank is considered to be well-capitalized. As a result, the Bank pays lower federal deposit insurance premiums than those banks that are not “well capitalized.” Requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution and for minimum capital adequacy along with the Bank's regulatory capital ratios are as follows at December 31, 2021 and 2020 under the regulatory capital rules then in effect:
1 Excluding average PPP loan balances of $62.0 million, the Bank’s Tier 1 Capital (to average assets) ratio would have been approximately 9.35% at December 31, 2020.
A well-capitalized institution, which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the Prompt Corrective Action regulations issued by the FDIC and the FRB, is one which maintains a Total Risk-Based ratio of 10% or above, a Tier 1 Risk-Based ratio of 8% or above, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or above, and a Leverage ratio of 5% or above, and is not subject to any written order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Maintaining strong capital is essential to Salisbury and the Bank’s safety and soundness. However, the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth, meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices.
The FRB’s final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company and the Bank met each of their capital requirements and the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as “well-capitalized.” There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.
On September 17, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FRB and the FDIC published its final rule establishing a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (“CBLR”) that simplifies capital requirements for certain community banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets (such as the Bank). Under the final rule, depository institutions and their holding companies that meet certain criteria (generally, those with limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and temporary difference deferred tax assets) (“qualifying community banking organizations”) may elect to report the components of its Tier 1 leverage ratio as a measure of capital adequacy. A qualifying community banking organization with a CBLR of greater than 9% that “elects to use the CBLR framework” will not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements and will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of the agencies’ Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) framework. Under the final rule, if a bank that has opted to use the CBLR framework subsequently fails to satisfy one or more of the qualifying criteria, but continues to report a leverage ratio of greater than 8 %, the bank may continue to use the framework and will be deemed “well capitalized” for a grace period of up to two quarters. A qualifying community banking organization will be required to comply with the generally applicable capital rule and file the relevant regulatory reports if the banking organization: (1) is unable to restore compliance with all qualifying criteria during the two-quarter grace period( including achieving compliance with the greater than 9% leverage ratio requirement); (2) reports a leverage ratio of 8% or less; or (3) ceases to satisfy the qualifying criteria due to consummation of a merger transaction. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020. The Bank would qualify for the CBLR methodology and would also be considered to be well capitalized if it elected to utilize such methodology. The Bank is currently evaluating the benefits of transitioning to this simplified methodology for assessing capital adequacy.
On April 6, 2020, the regulators announced that the CBLR will be modified so that: (1) beginning in the second quarter 2020 and until the end of the year, a banking organization that has a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and meets certain other criteria may elect to use the CBLR framework; and (2) community banks will have until January 1, 2022 before the CBLR requirement is re-established at greater than 9%. Under the interim final rules, the CBLR was 8% beginning in the second quarter 2020 and for the remainder of the calendar year, 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter. The Bank is currently evaluating the benefits of transitioning to this simplified methodology for assessing capital adequacy.
Share Repurchases
On March 24, 2021 Salisbury announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a share repurchase program. The share repurchase program provides for the potential repurchase of Salisbury’s common stock in amounts up to an aggregate of five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of Salisbury’s common stock from time to time over the twelve (12) months following the adoption of the plan through privately negotiated transactions and/or market purchases at appropriate prices, subject to price and market conditions on terms determined to be in the best interests of Salisbury. Salisbury did not repurchase any of its outstanding shares in 2021.
Dividends
During 2021 Salisbury declared and paid quarterly common stock dividends of $0.29 in first quarter, $0.30 in second quarter, and $0.31 in third and fourth quarter, respectively, totaling $3.5 million. In 2020, Salisbury declared and paid four quarterly common stock dividends of $0.29 per common share each quarter, totaling $3.2 million. In January 2022, the Board of Directors of Salisbury declared a common stock dividend of $0.32 per common share payable on February 25, 2022 to shareholders of record on February 11, 2022. Common stock dividends, when declared, will generally be paid the last business day of February, May, August and November, although Salisbury is not obligated to pay dividends on those dates or at any other time.
Salisbury's ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on the Bank's ability to pay cash dividends to Salisbury. There are certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends and other payments by the Bank to Salisbury. Under Connecticut law, the Bank cannot declare a cash dividend except from net profits, defined as the remainder of all earnings from current operations. The total of all cash dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year shall not, unless specifically approved by the Banking Commissioner, exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years.
FRB Supervisory Letter SR 09-4, February 24, 2009, revised March 30, 2009, states that, as a general matter, the Board of Directors of a Bank Holding Company (“BHC”) should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce dividends if (1) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (3) the BHC will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Moreover, a BHC should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the BHC capital position.
Salisbury believes that the payment of common stock cash dividends is appropriate, provided that such payment considers Salisbury's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of Salisbury or the Bank. The continued payment of common stock cash dividends by Salisbury will be dependent on Salisbury's future core earnings, financial condition and capital needs, regulatory restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of Salisbury.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements.
IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money, over time, due to inflation. Unlike some other types of companies, the financial nature of Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, inflation does affect Salisbury to some extent because, as prices increase, the money supply grows and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations. There is no precise method, however, to measure the effects of inflation on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation. Although not a material factor in recent years, inflation could impact earnings in future periods.
