Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion provides additional information regarding our results of operations and financial condition for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which appear beginning in Item 8 of this report. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.
We have made, and will continue to make, various forward-looking statements with respect to financial and business matters. Comments regarding our business that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures, see the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this annual report.
Recent Mutual-to-Stock Conversion and Reorganization
The Company, a Georgia corporation, was formed on March 5, 2021 to serve as the savings and loan holding company for the Bank. The Bank is a federally chartered savings bank headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia that has served the banking needs of our customers since 1934. On July 20, 2021, the Bank completed a mutual-to-stock conversion in a series of transactions by which it reorganized its corporate structure from a mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank, and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the reorganization and conversion, the Company sold 4,898,350 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, which we refer to as the “stock offering,” and on July 21, 2021, the Company’s common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “TCBC.”
Before the reorganization and conversion, the Company conducted no operations other than organizational activities. In this annual report, unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company and the Bank, except that if the discussions relate to a period before July 20, 2021, these terms refer solely to the Bank.
Overview
We are a full service community bank that provides a variety of services to individual and commercial accounts in our market areas. Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from our operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial and multi-family residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and land development loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $380.9 million, loans, net of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees, of $266.3 million, total deposits of $289.3 million and total shareholders' equity of $86.8 million. During 2019, the Bank elected to be treated as a "covered savings association" which allows us to engage in the same activities as a national bank.
Our primary deposit products are personal checking accounts, business checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Our lending products include single-family residential loans, construction loans, land development loans and SBA/USDA guaranteed loans.
We expect to continue to focus on originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial and multi-family residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and land development loans and consumer loans. Although in recent years, we have increased our focus, consistent with what we believe to be conservative underwriting standards, on originating higher yielding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans.
We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises. In recent years, we have originated single-family owner-occupied loans for sale into the secondary market and for our own portfolio. We intend to continue this activity in the future in order to generate fee income.
As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income as interest rates increase. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products and we are continuing to diversify
our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans. We will seek to continue to increase our core checking accounts during 2022.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to provide long-term value to our shareholders, depositors, customers, employees and the communities we serve by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing earnings. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a community-focused bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market areas, and we believe that the increased capital resulting from the completion of our stock offering will enable us to compete more effectively with other financial institutions.
Our current business strategy consists of the following:
•Leverage the infrastructure of the Bank to create additional value for depositors, employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. We seek to improve our operating efficiency as we optimize a new core processing system that was implemented in 2020 in order to enhance service features for both retail and business customers, and continue the process improvements implemented over the last two years. Our efficiency ratio has gradually improved from 85.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019, before regressing slightly to 91.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 76.7% as of December 31, 2021. The increase in 2020 in our efficiency ratio was directly related to the implementation costs associated with the new core processing system and the recognition of previously deferred conversion expenses, which also contributed to our decline in net income. Based on the personnel and systems now in place, we believe we can continue our trend of improving our operational efficiency, particularly as we are able to utilize the capital raised in the stock offering to grow assets and increase top line revenue. Although management currently has no definitive plans or commitments to add an additional branch in Tallahassee or expand its presence in the Savannah, Georgia market, we foresee the opportunity to add both an additional branch in Tallahassee, Florida and to expand our presence in the Savannah, Georgia market.
We believe our existing infrastructure will support prudent growth in assets and deposits initially without additional infrastructure expenditures thereby allowing us to improve our net interest income and non-interest income without significant increases in our non-interest expense. Our commercial loan production office in Savannah and our residential mortgage office in Tallahassee were each opened in 2017 and each has the potential to support meaningful additional growth without requiring significant expansion. We also believe further growth is possible in both markets by expanding our presence. Our core processing system conversion was completed in late 2020 which we believe improved our competitive position with constituencies that demand digital access to accounts for the movement of money through expanded capability made available in the new core processing system.
•Grow our loan portfolio prudently. We intend to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio of loans, with an emphasis on commercial and multi-family real estate loans and residential mortgage loans. We expect to be able to continue to grow our loan portfolio, having grown our outstanding loans $3.9 million, or 1.5%, from year-end 2020 through year-end 2021, and $9.7 million, or 4.1%, from year-end 2019 through year-end 2020. We participated in the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), originating $8.7 million of PPP loans in 2021, and $25.1 million in 2020, which contributed to much of our loan growth in 2020. Only $1.3 million in PPP loans were still outstanding as of year-end 2021. Our participation in the PPP also resulted in an increase in our core deposit accounts as PPP loan proceeds were initially deposited with the Bank. In addition, as the economy recovers from the pandemic, we expect increased loan volume from these new customers. We believe the capital we raised in our stock offering will provide additional support for continued loan growth throughout our market areas. We also intend to continue to grow our commercial lending activities through government sponsored loan programs, such as the SBA and USDA loan programs. Through our residential mortgage office in Tallahassee, we will continue to seek to originate residential loans for our portfolio as well as for sale in the secondary market, using multiple correspondent relationships for the sale of residential mortgages on a servicing-released basis. Residential lending introduces new customer relationships to the Bank and provides an opportunity for us to offer additional banking services to those clients.
For much of the Bank’s existence as a federal savings bank, our loan portfolio focused on residential mortgage lending. However, in the first decade of the 2000’s, we expanded our loan product mix and now have a diversified mix of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and land development loans and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2021, 36.3% of our loan portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans, 40.6% were commercial and multi-family real estate loans, 12.7% were construction and land development loans, 5.9% were commercial and industrial loans, 4.2% were home equity loans and 0.5% were consumer loans. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans increased $21.9 million, or 24.8%, to $109.8 million as of December 31, 2021 from $87.9 million at December 31, 2020, commercial and industrial loans decreased $13.7 million, or 46.3%, to $15.9 million as of December 31, 2021 from $29.6 million at December 31, 2020, while
construction and land development loans, increased $4.4 million, or 14.7%, to $34.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $30.0 million at December 31, 2020.
•Continue to increase core deposits. We seek to increase the proportion of our deposit base consisting of core deposits in order to provide a stable source of funds to support loan growth, at costs consistent with improving our interest rate spread and margin. Historically, we have relied heavily on certificates of deposit but in recent years we have been building a core deposit base. We have begun reducing deposit costs to market rates and by placing greater emphasis on developing core deposits. As part of our focus on commercial loan growth, our lenders are expected to seek to secure non-interest bearing business checking accounts from our borrowers. We have begun reducing deposit costs to market rates and placed greater emphasis on developing core deposits. As a result of these efforts and recognizing the impact of the government’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, core deposits increased by $9.3 million, or 4.5%, to $216.8 as of December 31, 2021 from $207.5 million at December 31, 2020. Management will continue to emphasize the growth of both retail and commercial core deposits.
Core deposits also help us maintain loan-to-deposit ratios at levels consistent with regulatory expectations. We consider our core deposits to include checking accounts (both interest-bearing and non-interest bearing), savings accounts and money market deposit accounts. However, we will also explore utilizing non-core funding sources, such as CDARs and brokered deposits, and may use borrowings, as needed, to fund future loan growth and our operations.
•Maintain Credit Standards while Growing. We believe strong asset quality is a critical key to our long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, prudent loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. Our non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.40% as of December 31, 2021 and 0.59% at December 31, 2020. In anticipation of future growth, we invested in the enhancement of our credit function by hiring additional experienced credit staff, implemented enhanced internal and external credit review processes, and implemented new technology for underwriting processing and credit analysis. We intend to maintain the high value of our credit culture, both in personnel as well as ancillary support systems, in order to be able to evaluate more complex loans and better manage credit risk, which will also support our intended loan growth, especially in the commercial loan market. During 2020 as a result of the pandemic, we reached a peak of 17.0% of loan customers by principal balance that sought a payment deferment. However, as of December 31, 2021, all customers had exited their loan deferment period, and no customers were deferring payments. To date, in spite of the pandemic, our loan portfolio continues to perform at a high level.
•Supplement organic growth through opportunistic bank or branch acquisitions. Although management has no current definitive plans or commitments to acquire other institutions or financial services businesses, we expect to consider acquisition opportunities that we believe would enhance the value of our franchise and yield potential financial benefits for our shareholders. The capital we raised in our stock offering may provide us the opportunity to acquire other institutions and financial services businesses located within a reasonable proximity of our current market areas. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of, and execute on, opportunities given the infrastructure improvements we have undertaken, including the upgrade of our core processing system and expanded management expertise.
•Enhance the sales, marketing and service culture. We believe that loyalty is a key component of the success of community banks. We will continue to develop loyalty with our community and our customers. We will invest in customer and community relationships with the spirit of a servant’s heart and servant leadership. We expect to serve customers when and how they wish to be served within the boundaries of safe and sound risk management. Our technology was significantly enhanced during 2020, including an expansion of our digital banking capabilities, as a result of our core conversion upgrade and ancillary services. We plan to continue to optimize the system for greater internal efficiencies and customer interactions. We believe the core system will allow us to materially improve the customer experience and help us facilitate greater cross selling.
•Expand our employee base to support future growth. We plan to continue to build depth and expertise as needed with increases in our size and complexity grows.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Our historically careful underwriting practices and diverse loan portfolio has helped minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic on our operating results. In addition, the combination of the vaccine rollout, government stimulus payments, and reduced spending during the pandemic are likely contributing factors mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our customers as of December 31, 2021. In addition, as economic forecasts improved in 2021, we recaptured a portion of our provision for loan losses, compared with higher provision expense in 2020. However, there are continuing concerns that indicate a slower return to pre-pandemic routines, including concerns related to increases in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths leading to additional government imposed restrictions; refusals to receive the vaccine along with concerns related to new strains of the virus; supply chain issues remaining unresolved longer than anticipated; labor shortages and wage
increases continuing to impact many industries; consumer confidence and spending falls; and rising geopolitical tensions. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the pandemic, it is difficult to predict its future adverse financial impact to the Company, although we expect to continue to be impacted by the pandemic in 2022. Specifically, we expect the following balance sheet and income statement categories could be affected:
•In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between 0.0% and 0.25%, compared to the previous target of between 1.00% and 1.25%. These rate reductions, combined with the decline of longer-term interest rates, reduced our net interest income to lower levels during 2020 and 2021, compared to what we experienced for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2021, net interest income increased $377,000, compared to 2020, due to an increase in average earning assets. In 2020 and 2021, PPP fee income was recorded as interest income, which partially offset the decline in interest income due to rate reductions. After the PPP loans have been fully paid off or forgiven, we expect lower levels of interest income going forward if market rates of interest remain at low levels.
•Although the economy has experienced a certain level of recovery in 2021, economic assumptions used to calculate our allowance for loan losses may deteriorate causing us to increase our allowance.
Lending Operations and Accommodations to Borrowers
•Starting in March 2020, we modified the terms of loans with customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to permit payment deferral. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these deferrals had affected a total of $46.6 million of loans, including $4.0 million of construction loans, $2.8 million of commercial and industrial loans, $7.9 million of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and $17.9 million of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. These deferrals were intended to provide customers with temporary relief. At year-end 2020, none of the loans with modification were still on modified terms. We believe these actions provided our customers with the best chance to meet their longer-term obligations and for us to work with those who will not be able to meet their obligations or default on their loans. In 2021, there were no COVID-19 related payment deferrals.
•We did not automatically downgrade borrowers that requested a deferral. However, if the borrower requested a deferral that extended beyond the initial three months granted, we considered downgrades based on the trend in revenues. During 2020, we downgraded to substandard $2.1 million in loans that were placed on deferral, and combined with our other lending activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, these adjustments resulted in a provision for loan losses of $780,000. In 2021, there were no COVID-19 related loan downgrades.
•During 2020, as part of the PPP, we originated 307 PPP loans totaling $25.1 million. In January 2021 through May 31, 2021, when the PPP program ended, we originated an additional 141 PPP loans totaling $8.7 million. Payment of principal, interest and fees on PPP loans is deferred until the amount to be forgiven is finalized, in general. We were paid a processing fee by the SBA on PPP loan originations ranging from 1% to 5% of the amount of the loan, based on the size of the loans. We recorded approximately $481,000 in PPP-related SBA fees for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and we are accreting these fees into interest income over the estimated life of the applicable loans. If a PPP loan is forgiven or paid off before maturity, the remaining unearned fee is recognized into income at that time. As of December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $678,000 in PPP-related SBA fees through accretion. The majority of the remaining unearned fees are expected to be recognized during 2022 as the remaining $1.4 million in PPP loans are either forgiven or paid off.
Anticipated Increase in Noninterest Expense
Now that we have completed the conversion and stock offering, which resulted in us becoming an SEC public reporting company, we expect our noninterest expense may increase due to the increased costs of operating as a public company, and the possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our shareholders, no earlier than six months after the completion of the conversion and stock offering.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2021.
Certain accounting policies inherently involve a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. We consider these accounting policies
and estimates to be critical accounting estimates. We have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and income taxes to be our significant accounting policies that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates.
The following represent our significant accounting policies:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. Loans are charged off when the Asset Quality Committee (which consists of Board and management members) believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in the Asset Quality Committee’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. The Asset Quality Committee’s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment. The evaluation process involves gathering and interpreting many qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses. Because interpretation and analysis involve judgment, current economic or business conditions can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses could change significantly.
The allocation methodology we apply is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and includes allocations for specifically identified impaired loans and loss factor allocations for all remaining loans, with a component primarily based on historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors. The methodology includes evaluation and consideration of several factors, such as, but not limited to, an ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. While the Asset Quality Committee uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or circumstances underlying the collectability of loans. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. The Asset Quality Committee believed the allowance for loan losses is appropriate at December 31, 2021. The allowance analysis is reviewed by the Asset Quality Committee on a no less than quarterly basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, various regulatory agencies and our external auditors, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. As a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process of establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of the Asset Quality Committee.
In 2021, COVID-19 continued to spread as a worldwide pandemic. The pandemic may continue to impact various parts of our future operations and financial results, including additional allowance for loan loss provisions. Management believes we have taken appropriate actions to mitigate the negative impact. However, the full impact of COVID-19 on our allowance for loan losses in future periods cannot be reasonably estimated, as these events are still developing.
Income Taxes. The assessment of income tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretation, and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management’s current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the results of operations and reported earnings.
We file a federal and a state income tax return. Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax law rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income tax expense. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that a portion of the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We may also recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured in the financial statements. Penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and 2020
Total assets. Total assets increased $31.0 million, or 8.9%, to $380.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $349.9 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was principally due to increases in investment securities available for sale of $29.2 million and net loans of $3.9 million.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, and certificates of deposit with other banks, decreased $2.2 million, or 4.6%, to $45.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $47.5 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in deposits of $4.8 million and Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $9.5 million as all advances were paid off in 2021. These increases in cash and cash equivalents were offset by increases in loans of $3.9 million, investments of $29.7 million and shareholders' equity of $46.9 million due to the net stock proceeds received in the offering.
Total Loans. Total loans increased $3.9 million, or 1.5%, to $271.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $267.5 million at December 31, 2020. Construction and land development loans increased $4.4 million to $34.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $30.0 million at December 31, 2020, while commercial and multi-family real estate loans decreased $21.9 million, or 24.9%, to 109.8 million from $87.9 million at December 31, 2020, and commercial and industrial loans decreased $13.7 million, or 46.3%, to $15.9 million, of which $1.4 million were PPP loans, at December 31, 2021 from $29.6 million at December 31, 2020. We have recently increased our focus on commercial lending, including construction lending, and our construction lending has benefitted from the opening of our LPO in Savannah, Georgia in 2017. One- to four- family residential real estate loans remained the largest loan category, however, balances of such loans held for investment decreased $7.4 million, or 7.0%, to $98.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $105.8 million at December 31, 2020. As a percentage of the net loan portfolio, residential real estate loans fell to 36.3% at December 31, 2021 from 39.6% at December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan Losses. Management's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by chargeoffs, net of recovery. Our allowance for loan losses was $4.2 million, or 1.54% of gross loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to $4.1 million, or 1.53% of gross loans at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was one $315,000 SBA guaranteed loan downgraded to substandard that resulted in a $79,000 credit loss. Combined with our other lending activities these adjustments resulted in our recording a $123,000 provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $780,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We had 27 impaired loans, totaling $1.5 million at December 31, 2021, compared to 25 loans totaling $2.8 million at December 30, 2020. At December 31, 2021, there were no specific reserves and $32,000 was unallocated. We had $25,000 in net chargeoffs for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net recoveries of $241,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses, which was $4.2 million, or 1.54% of gross loans, at December 31, 2021, is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
Investment securities. Investment securities, all of which are available-for-sale, and other investments increased $29.2 million, or 175.5% to $45.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $16.6 million at December 31, 2020. Investment securities available-for-sale increased $29.7 million or 186.7% to $45.6 million at December 31, 2021 from $15.9 million at December 31, 2020. We have invested excess cash in higher-yielding securities instead of lower yielding cash and cash equivalents..
Bank Owned Life Insurance. Bank owned life insurance increased $284,000, or 2.6%, to $11.2 million as of December 31, 2021 from $10.9 million as of December 31, 2020. We invest in bank owned life insurance to provide us with a funding offset for our benefit plan obligations. Bank owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. Federal regulations generally limit our investment in bank owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses, and indicates that an institution holding bank owned life insurance in an amount in excess of 25% should expect examiners to closely scrutinize the risk management policies and controls associated with bank owned life assets and, where deficient, to require corrective action. Our investment in bank owned life insurance at December 31, 2021 was 16.4% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses.
Deposits. Total deposits decreased $4.8 million, or 1.6%, to $289.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $294.1 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in certificates of deposit, which decreased $14.1 million, or 16.2%, to $72.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $86.6 million at December 31, 2020, as we continued to take steps to reduce our use of this funding source. Money market accounts increased $1.0 million, or 1.1%, to $90.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $89.7 million at December 31, 2020. Interest-bearing checking accounts increased $101,000, or 0.2%, to $56.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $56.8 million at December 31, 2020. Additionally, savings accounts increased $1.7 million, or 5.4%, to $34.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $32.3 million at December 31, 2020. We have been able to fund loan growth from excess cash received from our July stock offering.
Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. We had no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2021, compared to $9.5 million at December 31, 2020, as all outstanding advances were paid off in July 2021. Federal Home Loan Bank
advances increased $6.7 million, or 139.3%, to $9.5 million at December 31, 2020, from $2.8 million at December 31, 2019 as we obtained two advances in April 2020 due to concern about potential liquidity as the pandemic’s effects on the economy intensified.
Shareholders' Equity. Total shareholders' equity increased $47.0 million, or 117.8% to $86.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $39.9 million at December 31, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion and related stock offering which resulted in net proceeds of $47.5 million that was offset by the purchase of shares of common stock by the ESOP of $3.9 million.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General. Net income increased $2.3 million, or 759.6%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $308,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to increases in both net interest income and other income and a decrease in provision expense, as described in more detail below.
Interest Income. Interest income increased $376,000, or 2.9%, to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to a $447,000, or 3.6%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income, offset by a decrease in interest earned on our interest earning deposits. Our average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, decreased $715,000, or 0.3%, to $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $268.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average yield on loans increased 18 basis points to 4.79% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.61% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as deferred fees were recognized when PPP loans were paid off in 2021. Our average interest-earning assets increased $30.6 million to $59.1 million, or 106.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average yield on our interest-earning assets decreased 61 basis points, or 66.3% to 0.31% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.92% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our securities average balance increased $9.4 million, or 47.2%, to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average yield on our securities decreased 59 basis points, or 28.2% to 1.50% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.3 million, or 57.0%, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on deposits due to lower interest rates. Specifically, interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased $842,000 or 56.0%, to $662,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from both a decrease in the average balance of and the average rate paid on certificates of deposit. The average balance of certificates of deposit decreased $19.2 million, or 19.6%, to $78.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest expense on savings and money market accounts decreased $456,000, or 63.0%, to $268,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease resulted from the decline in the average rate we paid on savings and money market accounts partially offset by an increase in the average balances of savings and money market accounts. The average balance of savings and money market accounts increased $19.9 million, or 17.2%, to $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average yield on our savings and money market accounts decreased 43 basis points to 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.63% for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting lower market interest rates. The increase in the average balance of savings and money market accounts reflected in part, our customers’ response to the pandemic. Interest expense on interest-bearing checking accounts increased $16,000, or 51.6%, to $52,000 at December 31, 2021 from $31,000 at December 31, 2020, as the balance of our average interest-bearing checking accounts for 2021 increased $9.5 million to $52.2 million from $42.7 million for 2020.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $1.7 million, or 16.1%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of a higher balance of net interest-earning assets and, to a lesser extent, a higher net interest margin. Our average net interest-earning assets increased by $39.0 million, or 12.3%, to $356.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $317.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to a $30.6 million increase in the average balances of our interest-earning deposits and a $9.4 million increase in our average securities. Our net interest rate spread increased by 17 basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.23% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 3.49% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting primarily the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets combined with the greater reduction in our cost of funds as compared to our yield on interest-earning assets.
Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost
The following tables set forth for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing
liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, net interest margin (otherwise known as net yield on interest-earning assets), and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are not material. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial.
(1)Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.
(2)Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Provision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See the section entitled "Critical Accounting Estimates" in this Item 7, and the section entitled "Allowance for Loan Losses” in Item 1of this report..
Our allowance for loan losses was $4.2 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses to total net loans increased to 1.54% at December 31, 2021 from 1.53% at December 31, 2020, and the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 1010.6% at December 31, 2021 from 206.5% at December 31, 2020. We increased the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial real estate loans due to potential loan losses from the ongoing effects of the pandemic, in the absence of other factors, would result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses as we apply historical loss ratios to newly originated loans. We modestly increased the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to construction and land development loans despite an increase in this portion of the loan portfolio, as we have a low loss history with respect to construction and land development loans.
To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2021. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.
Other Income. Non-interest income information is as follows.
In 2021, other income increased approximately $922,000 from 2020, or a 45.4% increase from the previous year. This increase is primarily due to the sale of $99.5 million of residential mortgage loans during 2021 that generated $2.1 million in gain on sale of mortgage loans compared to a $1.2 million gain for 2020.
Other Expense. Non-interest expense information is as follows.
Overall, our non-interest expenses increased $187,000, or 1.6%, in 2021 to $11.8 million from 2020, primarily due to the $986,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits due primarily to variable compensation paid to our mortgage lenders as a result of increased mortgage closings, the $335,0000 increase in 2021 ESOP expense and a $282,000 increase in checking account related expenses due to the increase in our checking accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in data system conversion costs due to our system conversion completed in 2020 and a $272,000 decrease in legal fees due to legal expense associated with our stock offering that were recognized in 2020, even though the stock offering was delayed until 2021.
Since the consummation of the conversion and stock offering was completed in the third quarter of 2021, we expect noninterest expense to increase in 2022 because of the costs associated with operating as a public company, and the increased compensation expenses associated with the possible implementation of a stock-based benefit plan, if approved by our shareholders.
Income Tax Expense. We incurred income tax expense of $823,000 and $367,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective rates of 23.8% and 11.4%, respectively. The differences in the effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 and the statutory federal rate of 21% are mainly due to fluctuations in pretax earnings, state income taxes and tax exempt income.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following schedule presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.
Management of Market Risk
General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.
We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:
•growing the loan portfolio, with a focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, in accordance with our risk appetite, while operating in a safe and sound manner;
•increasing the diversification of our loan portfolio; and
•growing our level of core deposits.
By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react in increased in market interest rates. Beginning in the calendar year 2020, we introduced adjustable-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans (in addition to our existing home equity loans and lines of credit, which are originated with adjustable interest rates), and we expect to increase our investment securities portfolio, with an average maturity of less than 15 years. In addition, we generally only originate fixed-rate residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary mortgage market.
Net Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through an interest rate risk model, developed by a third-party provider. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantly by up to 400 basis points or decreases instantly by up to 200 basis points, in 100 point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the “Change in Interest Rates” column below.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.
(1)Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
Economic Value of Equity. We also compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity or “EVE”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 200 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.
The tables below set forth, as of December 31, 2021, the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.
(1)Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
(2)EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.
(3)Present value of assets represents the discounted value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.
(4)EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 11.09% increase in economic value of equity, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 36.93% decrease in economic value of equity.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and economic value of equity tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset.
Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At December 31, 2021, we had $15.7 million in borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, and had no outstanding advances as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have $19.5 million in unsecured federal funds lines of credit through our correspondent banks and $5.7 million secured borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. No amounts were outstanding on these lines of credit at December 31, 2021.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was ($3.9 million) and $647,644 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the
purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $33.1 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from the sale of our common stock, was $29 million and $27.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.
At December 31, 2021, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements, and we were categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $28.2 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments.
The following table is a summary of the total contractual amount of loan commitments outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 totaled $54.8 million. As a result of the current interest rate environment, a significant portion of funds have moved from certificate accounts to money market accounts, which provides the customer more flexibility and liquidity. We reduced both certificates of deposit and money market account rates accordingly. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. If a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new deposits, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Please refer to Note 1 to the Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 beginning on page for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Price
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative
purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
