ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
National Instruments Corporation and its subsidiaries (referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “National Instruments” or “NI”) has made forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein regarding our future financial performance, operations, plans, investments, expected effects of investments, or other matters (including, without limitation, statements to the effect that we “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend to,” “may,” "could," "can," “will,” “project,” "predict," “anticipate,” “continue,” “strive to,” “endeavor to,” “seek to,” “are committed to,” "remaining committed to"; “are encouraged by,” "remain cautious," "remain optimistic," “estimate”, "focus on"; statements of “goals,” “commitments,” "strategy" or “visions”; or other variations thereof or comparable terminology or the negative thereof) should be considered forward-looking statements.

We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” above and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements, due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business or under different assumptions or conditions. You should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Overview
For more than 40 years, we have enabled engineers and scientists around the world to accelerate productivity, innovation and discovery. Our software-centric platform provides an advanced approach through integration of software and modular hardware to create automated test and automated measurement systems. We believe our long-term track record of innovation and our differentiated platform help support the success of our customers, employees, suppliers, community and stockholders. We have been profitable in every year since 1990. We sell to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries. No single customer represented more than 3% of our sales in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The key strategies that we focus on in running our business are the following:
•Expanding our available market opportunity
We strive to increase our available market by identifying new opportunities in existing customers, attracting and serving new customers, and expanding our business to market adjacencies. Our large network of existing customers provides a broad base from which to expand.
•Maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction
To maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative, modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network. We strive to maintain a high degree of backward compatibility across different platforms to preserve the customer’s investment in our products. In this time of intense global competition, we believe it is crucial that we continue to offer products with high quality and reliability, and that our products provide cost-effective solutions for our customers.
•Leveraging external and internal technology
Our product strategy is to provide superior products by leveraging generally available technology, supporting open architectures on multiple platforms and by leveraging our core technologies across multiple products.
We sell into test and measurement and industrial/embedded applications in a broad range of industries and are subject to the economic and industry forces that drive those markets. Examples of these types of customers include semiconductor and electronics, transportation, and aerospace, defense and government.
•Leveraging a worldwide sales, distribution and manufacturing network
We distribute and sell our software and hardware products through a direct sales organization. We also use independent distributors, original equipment manufacturers, value added resellers, system integrators and consultants to market and sell our products. We have sales offices in the U.S. and sales offices and distributors in key international markets. Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 59%, 60% and 60% of our revenues in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019. The vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers’ local currency, which exposes us to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from international sales. (See Note 2 - Revenue and Note 14 - Segment information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning the geographic breakdown of our net sales and long-lived assets, respectively).
We manufacture substantially all of our product at our facilities in Debrecen, Hungary and Penang, Malaysia.
•Delivering high quality, reliable products
We believe that our long-term growth and success depend on delivering high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis. Accordingly, we focus significant efforts on research and development. We focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and developing new products that incorporate appropriate features and functionality to be competitive with respect to technology, price and performance. Our success also depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights related to technologies used in our products. We have engaged in litigation when necessary, and will likely engage in future litigation to protect our intellectual property rights.
Our operating results fluctuate from period to period due to changes in global economic conditions and a number of other factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. There can be no assurance that our net sales will grow, or not decline, or that we will remain profitable in future periods.
Current Business Outlook
We are continuing to experience strong demand from our customers across the geographic regions and end markets that we serve, with the value of total orders during 2021 increasing by approximately 24% compared to the same period in 2020. Although the strength and duration of the recent trends will vary by region and offering, we remain optimistic about opportunities for additional revenue growth expected in 2022. We expect our customers will continue to make investments in emerging technologies related to 5G/mmWave, vehicle electrification, ADAS and new space innovation.
Although we continue to experience shortages of certain components due to global capacity constraints, we currently expect supply chain pressures to stabilize in 2022. Historically, our backlog levels have remained fairly consistent at the end of each quarter, representing approximately a week of quarterly sales activity, and the majority of these orders are fulfilled quickly within the following quarter. Strong demand and longer lead times to fulfill orders for certain offerings have continued to shift the timing of revenue recognition into future periods and increased backlog significantly over the past 12 months. While we expect to continue to experience some challenges related to these supply chain constraints as the global supply chain continues to adjust to the significant increases in demand, we are optimistic about our ability to maintain competitive lead times while continuing to maintain higher backlog levels as part of our strategic focus on application-specific system offerings through 2022 and beyond.
As a result of the short-term component shortages described above, we are experiencing higher costs to obtain a consistent supply of certain components. In 2022, we also expect operating costs to increase due to wage inflation and increased travel. During 2022 we also intend to accelerate our transition to a predominantly subscription-based licensing model for the majority of our software offerings. While we expect our subscription base, recurring revenue and cash flow to increase over time as a result of this licensing model transition, we expect some initial headwinds to our net sales and operating profitability during the transition period. However, we expect recent additions and enhancements to our software portfolio will continue to differentiate our products and fuel demand across our end markets. Despite these headwinds, we are confident in our ability to continue to accelerate growth and improve our operating profitability through sustainable increases in demand attributable to recent investments that enhance our system and software offerings, realization of strategic price increases, and robust expense management.
As part of our efforts to streamline our operations and enhance the experience of our customers, we have also increased our focus on customer account tiers when assessing trends in our order growth. Specifically, we have grouped our customers into tiers based on their historical spending patterns and potential for future order growth. Our "Focus" account tiers are comprised of approximately 2,500 accounts we have identified as having a high potential to maintain or expand our business through application-specific system offerings. The Focus tier currently represents approximately 70% of our total order value. Our "Broad-based" account tier is comprised of the remainder of our customer base of approximately 30,000 accounts. The Broad-based tier currently represents approximately 30% of our total order value. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, orders from our Focus accounts and Broad-based accounts increased by 13% and 34%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2020.
We also continue to focus on scale and efficiency when engaging with our Broad-based customers. Our focus to streamline the process of doing business with NI means both scaling our costs and improving the experience of the large number of smaller accounts we serve. This commitment and focus include plans to invest in ni.com for a better digital experience and continue to significantly expand the customer reach of our distributor channel during 2022 and beyond. We are also simplifying our product offerings for the Broad-based customers to make our products easier-to-use. We believe these actions will allow our direct sales force to accelerate our revenue growth through proactive engagements with accounts where we can deliver enterprise-level value. During 2021, sales to our distributors represented approximately 10% of our total net sales, compared to 2% in 2020. As of December 31, 2021, our distributors were not carrying significant amounts of our products in inventory and were not eligible for any significant adjustments or variable consideration related to their previous purchases. As of December 31, 2021 no single distributor accounted for more than 2% of our total net sales.
Acquisitions and divestitures
On April 23, 2021, we completed the acquisition of a software company that specializes in signal processing and high-fidelity simulation software for validation of autonomous vehicles and ADAS for approximately $20 million in total cash consideration, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. All of the acquired assets and liabilities of the software company have been recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We recognized approximately $17 million of goodwill and $4 million of other intangible assets as part of our preliminary purchase price allocation. Transaction costs have been expensed as incurred and were not material to the periods presented. See Note 18 - Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On October 19, 2021, we completed the acquisition of NH Research, LLC ("NHR"), a manufacturer of test and measurement solutions for high power applications including electric vehicles and batteries. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. All of the acquired assets and liabilities of the acquired business were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Transaction costs were expensed as incurred. At the acquisition date, total consideration transferred was approximately $206 million, inclusive of $3 million in cash acquired. The acquisition was primarily funded by $200 million drawn under our credit facility in October 2021. See Note 15 - Debt and See Note 18 - Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On July 2, 2020, we completed our acquisition of OptimalPlus. Total proceeds used to acquire the business and replace certain unvested share options consisted of approximately $365 million in cash, inclusive of $18 million in cash acquired. (See Note 1 - Basis of presentation and Note 18 - Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.)
On January 15, 2020, we completed the sale of AWR Corporation ("AWR") for approximately $161 million. We recognized a gain of approximately $160 million on the sale. The gain is included within "Gain on sale of business/assets" in the consolidated statements of income, which also included approximately $1 million of transaction costs. (See Note 1 - Basis of presentation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.)
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of net sales represented by geographic region and by certain items reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
Figures may not sum due to rounding.
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021 (our “2020 Annual Report”).
Net Sales. The following table sets forth our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 along with the percent changes between the corresponding periods.
Figures may not sum due to rounding.
•The increase in product sales during 2021 was primarily attributable to stronger demand for our system-level offerings, particularly in semiconductor and electronics test solutions as well as our transportation-related offerings. Net sales into these end markets increased approximately 21 and 27 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, we implemented price increases in each of our geographic regions, which increased net sales by approximately 6 percent compared to the same periods in 2020. Additional discussion on the increase in net sales by geographic region is provided below. Revenue from recent acquisitions also increased net sales by approximately 2 percent.
•The increase in software maintenance sales during 2021 was primarily related to additional billings from our software-related recurring revenue streams during the trailing twelve months, including annual renewals of software maintenance programs and the software-maintenance component of our subscription licensing offerings, which consist primarily of our enterprise-level licenses for LabVIEW and our product analytics offerings.
The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 along with the changes between the corresponding periods and the region’s percentage of total net sales.
Figures may not sum due to rounding.
We expect sales outside of the Americas to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. We intend to continue to expand our international operations by increasing our presence in existing markets, adding a presence in certain new geographical markets and continuing to increase the use of distributors to sell our products in some countries.
Almost all of the sales made by our direct sales offices in the Americas (excluding the U.S.), EMEA, and APAC are denominated in local currencies, and accordingly, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations between periods, we compare the percentage change in our results from period to period using constant currency calculations. To calculate the change in constant currency, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e.) the average rates in effect during the years ended December 31, 2020). The following table presents this information, along with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in local currencies, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Figures may not sum due to rounding.
To help protect against changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales, we hedge portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in foreign currencies with average rate forward contracts. (See Note 5 - Derivative instruments and hedging activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our cash flow hedging program and its related impact on our consolidated sales for 2021 and 2020).
Gross Profit. The following table sets forth our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 along with the percentage changes in gross profit for the corresponding periods. We continue to focus on cost control and cost reduction measures throughout our manufacturing cycle.
The increases in our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales were primarily related to the following:
Operating Expenses. The following table sets forth our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 along with the percentage changes between the corresponding periods and the line item as a percentage of total net sales.
The $55 million increase in our total operating expenses, excluding the gain on sale of business/assets, during 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the following:
•$55 million increase in personnel costs, primarily attributable to higher salaries and accrued payments under our variable pay programs, as well as additional stock-based compensation expense (due to comparatively higher stock prices on the grant date of unvested RSU awards and a shorter average service period for our awards), which was partially offset by reductions in benefit costs due to lower headcount;
•$(30) million decrease in severance and other restructuring-related charges;
•$24 million increase related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, partially offset by lower acquisition-related transaction and integration costs;
•$4 million increase related to marketing and advertising costs;
•$3 million increase related to lower software development costs eligible for capitalization; and
•$(1) million decrease related to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Sales and Marketing
The primary drivers of the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 were additional personnel costs related to our variable compensation programs, amortization of acquired intangibles, and stock-based compensation expenses which were partially offset by lower severance-related charges and lower salaries due to a reduction in headcount.
Research and Development
The primary drivers of the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 were additional personnel costs related to our variable compensation programs, higher salaries and additional severance-related charges intended to further optimize our operations and accelerate our growth strategy, a decrease in software development costs eligible for capitalization, and higher stock-based compensation expenses.
General and administrative
The primary drivers of the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 were additional personnel costs related to our variable compensation programs and stock-based compensation expense partially offset by decreases in acquisition-related transaction costs, severance-related charges and a reduction in travel.
Gain on Sale of Business/Asset. On January 15, 2020, we completed the sale of our AWR subsidiary and recognized a gain on the sale of $160 million. On August 29, 2019, we sold an office building and property located in Austin, Texas and recognized a gain on the sale of $27 million. These amounts are presented as "Gain on sales of business/asset" in our Consolidated Statements of Income, in accordance with ASC 360 - Property, Plant and Equipment (See Note 1 - Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).
Operating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating income was $118 million, a decrease of 41% compared to 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The changes in operating income in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales in 2020 are attributable to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Gross Profit, Operating Expenses and Gain on Sale of Business/Asset above.
Other (Expense) Income.
•Interest Income. Interest income was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $3.5 million decrease in interest income compared to 2020 was primarily driven by lower cash and short-term investments. The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee recently indicated that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. As a result, we could see modest improvement in yields during the remainder of 2022.
•Interest Expense. Interest expense was approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, The $1.9 million increase in interest expense compared to 2020 was due to additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 15 - Debt for additional information regarding the terms of our revolving credit facility and related borrowings.
•Loss From Equity-Method Investments. Loss from equity-method investments was approximately $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily attributable to an impairment loss of $3.5 million recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2021.
•Net Foreign Exchange Loss. Net foreign exchange loss was $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of re-measuring foreign currency monetary and liabilities into the functional currency of the corresponding entity. The amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the period.
Provision for Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 14%. The factors that caused our effective tax rate to change year-over-year are detailed in the table below:
Other operational information
We believe that the following additional unaudited operational metrics assist investors in assessing our operational performance relative to others in our industry and to our historical results. The following tables provide details with respect to the amount of GAAP charges related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and fair value adjustments, acquisition-related transaction costs, disposal gains on sales of business/assets and related charitable contributions, tax effects on businesses held-for-sale, capitalization and amortization of internally developed software costs, and restructuring charges that were recorded in the line items indicated below (in thousands).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
At December 31, 2021, we had $211 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous financial institutions throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. The following table presents the geographic distribution of our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):
Figures may not sum due to rounding.
The following table presents our working capital, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments:
(1) Included in working capital
Our principal sources of liquidity include existing cash and cash equivalents balances and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, as well as the cash flows generated from our operations. The primary drivers of the net increase in working capital between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were:
•Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased by $109 million. Additional analysis of the changes in our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 are discussed below.
•"Accounts receivable, net" increased by $74 million which is primarily related to the timing of billings during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Days sales outstanding increased to 58 days at December 31, 2021, compared to 56 days at December 31, 2020.
•Inventory increased by $95 million. Inventory turns decreased to 1.5 at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.7 at December 31, 2020. The increase in inventory is primarily attributable to additional purchases of raw materials to support forecasted demand for our products and minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions as well as higher unit costs for certain components.
•Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by $21 million, primarily related timing of prepaid insurance, other prepaid renewals and changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts.
•Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by $32 million, primarily related timing of invoice payments to our suppliers for raw materials.
•Accrued compensation increased by $24 million primarily related to the increased attainment under our variable pay programs during 2021 that are to be paid out in 2022, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring-related accruals.
•The current portion of deferred revenue increased by $6 million due to increased billings related to renewals of our software maintenance and subscription-licensing offerings.
•Other current liabilities decreased by $2 million, primarily related to changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and the timing of certain tax payments.
•Operating lease liabilities, current decreased by $3 million.
•Other taxes payable increased by $11 million, primarily related to related to the timing of payments for VAT and other indirect taxes.
Analysis of Cash Flow
The following table summarizes the proceeds and (uses) of cash:
Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $37 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a $150 million decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities during the year, further described below, partially offset by a $113 million increase in net income excluding the effect of non-cash items including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of assets/business, and deferred tax benefits.
•The aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable used net cash of $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net cash used of $10 million in the comparable period in 2020. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable depends upon the cash conversion cycle, which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases, as well as collections and payments in a period. We have significantly increased inventory purchases in 2021 compared to 2020 to support current and anticipated demand for our products and minimize supply chain disruptions.
•The aggregate of other movements in assets and liabilities provided net operating cash of $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net operating cash provided of $50 million in the comparable period in 2020. The year over year change is primarily attributable to the timing of payments of federal income taxes, variable compensation programs and severance payments under our 2020 restructuring initiative.
Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $162 million compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to the following:
•$160 million decrease in cash inflows related to proceeds received from the sale of our AWR business in 2020.
•$118 million decrease in cash inflows related to the net sale of short-term investments. The net sale of short-term investments during both periods was primarily driven by funding needs related to our acquisitions and our common stock repurchase activities.
•$106 million decrease in cash outflows related to acquisitions and other strategic investments in equity-method investees.
•$9 million decrease in cash outflows related capital expenditures for long-lived assets.
Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities increased by $90 million for 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily related to a $102 million net increase in borrowings under our revolving and term loan facilities, net of issuance costs and repayments, partially offset by a $6 million increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock and an increase of $7 million related to our quarterly dividends. (See Note 12 - Authorized shares of common and preferred stock and stock-based compensation plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion about our share repurchase program).
Contractual Cash Obligations. Contractual obligations arise in the normal course of business and include debt and related interest payments, leases, purchase obligations, and warranty liabilities. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our lease obligations. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our transition tax payables. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt obligations. See Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our other contractual obligations.
Credit Agreement. On June 18, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender (the “Administrative Agent”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and bookrunner, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement amended and restated and refinanced our prior Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2020 (as further amended on October 30, 2020), by and among us, the lenders from time-to-time party thereto and Administrative Agent. As of December 30, 2021, we had $199 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. Proceeds of additional borrowings made under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may prepay the loans under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Certain of our future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the Credit Agreement. (See Note 15 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our Credit Agreement).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any off-balance sheet debt. At December 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships.
Prospective Capital Needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, cash generated from the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and available borrowing under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, commitments, payment of dividends to our stockholders and repurchases of our common stock for at least the next 12 months. We may also seek to pursue additional financing or to raise additional funds by seeking an increase in our secured revolving line of credit and/or term loan commitments under the Credit Agreement or selling equity or debt to the public or in private transactions from time to time. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.
Although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operating activities for at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. We anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors, including:
•payment of dividends to our stockholders;
•required levels of research and development and other operating costs;
•our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans, and product and technology roadmaps;
•acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies;
•repurchase of our common stock;
•the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins;
•the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain;
•general economic and political uncertainty and specific conditions in the markets we address, including any volatility in the industrial economy in the various geographic regions in which we do business;
•the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us, which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us;
•capital improvements for facilities;
•our relationships with suppliers and customers; and
•the amount of proceeds received as a result of our employee stock purchase plan.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 - Operations and summary of significant accounting policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be materially different from the estimates. Note 1 - Operations and summary of significant accounting policies in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The below accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
•Revenue recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of our products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions, historical pricing relationships (such as software licenses available under either a perpetual and term license period), and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of software licenses sold under enterprise-wide licensing program, judgment is required to identify the distinct performance obligations, determine the SSP for certain performance obligations that is not directly observable, and assess the pattern of delivery, including the utilization of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, and occasionally we may provide other credits or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. We analyze historical returns, current economic trends, and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
•Valuation of acquired intangible assets
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable intangible assets, such as acquired technology and customer relationships. Fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in these valuations. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of our acquired customer relationships were anticipated revenue growth rates and expected attrition. The significant assumption used to estimate the value of our existing product configurations was the anticipated lost profits for the period of time that would be necessary to develop the portfolio of products. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges, and those charges could be material to our results of operations.
•Estimating allowances, specifically the adjustment for excess and obsolete inventories
We also make estimates about the net realizable value of our inventory. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions. Our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was $18.9 million and $17.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing this allowance. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
•Long-lived Assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization of the reporting unit. Our annual impairment test was performed as of November 30, 2021.
Intangible assets with finite lives and property, plant and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis. We monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period. We test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an asset’s useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset’s useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had goodwill of approximately $576 million and $468 million, respectively and the carrying value of our acquisition-related intangibles assets was approximately $200 million and $127 million, respectively.
No impairment of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets was identified during 2021, 2020, or 2019.
•Accounting for income taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized.
Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. In estimating future tax consequences, all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates. We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements using prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns. Our continuing policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
We have not entered into any advanced pricing or other agreements with the Internal Revenue Service with regard to any foreign jurisdictions. For additional discussion about our income taxes including, components of income before income taxes, our provision for income taxes charged to operations, components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, a reconciliation of income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate and other tax matters, see Note 10 - Income taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
