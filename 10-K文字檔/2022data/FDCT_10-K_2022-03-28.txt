LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
On December 31, 2021, and 2020, we had a cash balance of $93,546 and $22,467, respectively. At December 31, 2021, and 2020, the working capital deficit was $199,132 and $1,504,678, respectively. The decrease in the working capital deficit was mainly due to the acquisition of ADS, resulting in the increase of current assets and settlement of FRH Group Note for shares of the Company, resulting in the decrease of current liabilities for the period ending December 31, 2021.
In the next twelve (12) months, the Company will continue investing in sales, marketing, product development, new technology solutions, and support of existing technology to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $250,000 in the next twelve (12) months to support the growth, including software development and purchasing computers and servers. Also, the Company estimates additional expenditure needed to be $250,000, which provides for $100,000 and $150,000 for sales and marketing and working capital, respectively.
We expect the combination of existing cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to private equity and capital markets to be sufficient for at least the next twelve (12) months. The availability of funds will fund our operating activities to meet the need for investing and financing, such as debt maturities and material capital expenditures. However, we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level to fund our ongoing operations out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.
Should we require additional capital, the Company’s operations are insufficient to fund its capital requirements. The Company may attempt to restructure Notes, refinance existing Notes with financial institutions, or raise capital by selling additional capital stock or debt issuance. The Company intends to continue its efforts in growing its operations and raising funds through private equity and debt financing.

Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result in the Company being unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
We have based our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations results on our financial statements, which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material.
We have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards after enacting the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies. We have applied for exemption as an emerging growth company; thus, the Company may delay adopting certain accounting standards until the standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC’s Regulation S-B. We did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The ASU amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We have adopted ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition from January 1, 2019, and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840) from January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe the accounting policies described in Note 2 are critical to the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements. As a result, we have described significant accounting policies in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021.
