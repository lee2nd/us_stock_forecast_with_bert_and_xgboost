ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Net income in 2021 was $95.7 million, up 13.5% from $84.3 million in 2020. Net income for 2020 was 3.1% lower than $87.0 million in 2019.
Diluted net income per common share was $3.74 in 2021, $3.30 in 2020 and $3.38 in 2019. Return on average total assets was 1.56% in 2021 versus 1.55% in 2020 and 1.76% in 2019. Return on average total equity was 14.19% in 2021 versus 13.51% in 2020 and 15.47% in 2019. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 36.36% in 2021, 36.36% in 2020 and 34.32% in 2019. The average equity to average assets ratio was 10.96% in 2021 compared to 11.51% in 2020 and 11.38% in 2019.
Net income in 2021 was positively impacted by a $15.1 million increase in net interest income and a $13.7 million decrease in provision for credit losses. Offsetting these positive impacts were a $13.1 million increase in noninterest expense and a $2.1 million decrease in noninterest income.
Net income in 2020 was $84.3 million, down 3.1% from $87.0 million in 2019 and up 4.9% from $80.4 million in 2018. Diluted net income per common share was $3.30 in 2020 and $3.38 in 2019. Return on average total assets was 1.55% in 2020 versus 1.76% in 2019. Return on average total equity was 13.51% in 2020 versus 15.47% in 2019. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 36.36% in 2020 and 34.32% in 2019. The average equity to average assets ratio was 11.51% in 2020 compared to 11.38% in 2019.
Net income in 2020 was positively impacted by an $8.0 million, or 5.1% increase, in net interest income and an $1.8 million, or 4.1% increase, in noninterest income. Offsetting these positive impacts was an $11.5 million, or 356.6% increase, in the provision for credit losses and an $1.8 million, or 2.0%, increase in noninterest expense.
Total assets were $6.557 billion as of December 31, 2021 versus $5.830 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $726.9 million or 12.5%. This increase was primarily due to a $663.7 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities and an increase in short-term investments of $455.9 million. The increase of investment securities reflects the deployment of $652 million in excess liquidity that resulted from deposit growth. Deposit growth was impacted by PPP and economic stimulus. Total average assets increased $729.0 million primarily due to a $434.4 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities and a $313.6 million increase in interest bearing deposits.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for expected credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans, although the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged against the allowance. A provision for credit losses is taken based on management’s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance. A formal evaluation of the adequacy of the credit loss allowance is conducted monthly. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company’s control.
The level of credit loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio, emerging market risk, emerging concentration risk, commercial loan focus and large credit concentration, new industry lending activity, general economic conditions and historical loss analysis. In addition, management gives consideration to changes in the facts and circumstances of watch list credits, which includes the security position of the borrower, in determining the appropriate level of the credit loss provision. Furthermore, management’s overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision.
The determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates by management. The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses that generally includes consideration of changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and overall portfolio quality, along with current and forecasted economic conditions that may affect borrowers’ ability to repay. Consideration is not limited to
these factors although they represent the most commonly cited factors. To determine the specific allocation levels for individual credits, management considers the current valuation of collateral and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows as the primary measures. Management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits. With respect to pools of similar loans, an appropriate level of general allowance is determined by portfolio segment using a probability of default-loss given default (“PD/LGD”) model, subject to a floor. A default can be triggered by one of several different asset quality factors, including past due status, nonaccrual status, TDR status or if the loan has had a charge-off. This PD is then combined with a LGD derived from historical charge-off data to construct a default rate. This loss rate is then supplemented with adjustments for reasonable and supportable forecasts of relevant economic indicators, particularly the unemployment rate forecast from the Federal Open Market Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections, and other environmental factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These environmental factors include consideration of the following: levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and nonperforming loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; changes in collateral strength; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedure, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. It is also possible that these factors could include social, political, economic, and terrorist events or activities. All of these factors are susceptible to change, which may be significant. As a result of this detailed process, the allowance results in two forms of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for credit losses deemed adequate to cover expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
Commercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration function. These grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a consensus is reached by credit administration and the loan review officer. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that indicate it should be evaluated on an individual basis. Considerations with respect to specific allocations for these individual credits include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) the sufficiency of the customer’s cash flow or net worth to repay the loan; (b) the adequacy of the discounted value of collateral relative to the loan balance; (c) whether the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination; (d) whether the loan is nonperforming; (e) any other reasons the ultimate collectability of the loan may be in question; or (f) any unique loan characteristics that require special monitoring.
Allocations are also applied to categories of loans considered not to be individually analyzed, but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. These general pooled loan allocations are performed for portfolio segments of commercial and industrial; commercial real estate, multi-family, and construction; agri-business and agricultural; other commercial loans; and consumer 1-4 family mortgage and other consumer loans. General allocations of the allowance are determined by a historical loss rate based on the calculation of each pool’s probability of default-loss given default, subject to a floor. The length of the historical period for each pool is based on the average life of the pool. The historical loss rates are supplemented with consideration of economic conditions and portfolio trends.
Due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for credit losses, the Company’s allowance for credit losses includes an unallocated component. The unallocated component of the allowance for credit losses incorporates the Company’s judgmental determination of potential expected losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations, including factors such as the level of classified credits, economic uncertainties, industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments, broad portfolio quality trends, and trends in the composition of the Company’s large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers. As a practical expedient, the Company has elected to state accrued interest separately from loan principal balances on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, when a loan is placed on non-accrual, interest payments are reversed through interest income.
For off balance sheet credit exposures outlined in the ASU at 326-20-30-11, it is the Company’s position that nearly all of the unfunded amounts on lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable, and therefore not subject to having a liability set up.
The allowance is inherently uncertain as it represents the Company’s expectation of the future collectability of loans in its portfolio; actual collections may be greater than or less than expectations. Actual collections may be impacted by wider economic conditions such as changes in the competitive environment or in the levels of business investment or consumer spending, or by the quality of borrowers’ management teams and the success of their strategy execution. Borrowers’ ability to repay may also change due to the effects of government monetary or fiscal policy, which could affect the level of demand for borrowers’ products or services.
The Company’s allowance for credit losses is subject to changes in the inputs to the model, including the following: the numbers of delinquent loans, nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructuring, or charge offs; the levels of charge offs and recoveries; projected unemployment rates and other economic indicators; the Company’s collateral position on adversely classified loans; or management’s qualitative judgment of the implication of trends in its loan portfolio or in the broader economy.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
In 2021 and 2020, the Company continued to grow loans and deposits organically, in its geographic footprint of northern Indiana and in central Indiana in the Indianapolis market. In addition, during 2021 and 2020 the Company was an active participant in the PPP. The Company had 51 branches as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s profitability has been positively impacted by growth in loans and deposits and a reduction in provision for credit losses. In addition, asset quality has remained stable. The core banking contributions to noninterest income of loan, wealth management, and merchant card interchange fee income increased in 2021. Overall, expense growth has reflected our continued investment in people, technology and our branch infrastructure. The outlook for 2022 includes plans for continued organic loan growth and expanding our lending radius, a disciplined credit philosophy, continued investment in the Company in the form of staff additions, continued expansion in our geographic footprint, and continued investments in customer-facing technology and cybersecurity risk management tools.
Selected income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented in the following table.
(1)Noninterest expense/Net interest income plus Noninterest income.
(2)Non-GAAP financial measure. Calculated by subtracting intangible assets, net of deferred tax, from total assets and total equity. Management believes this is an important measure because it is useful for planning and forecasting purposes. See reconciliation on the next page.
(3)Non-GAAP financial measure. Calculated by subtracting the impact PPP loans had on average earnings assets, loan interest income, average interest bearing liabilities, and interest expense. Management believes this is an important measure because it provide for better comparability to prior periods, given the expectation that PPP represents a limited governmental intervention in the lending market, designed to support small businesses through the pandemic, its low fixed interest rate of 1.0% and because the accretion of net loan fee income can be accelerated upon borrower forgiveness and repayment by the SBA. Management is actively monitoring net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis with and without PPP loan impact for the duration of this program. See reconciliation on the next page.
(4)Non-GAAP financial measure. Pretax pre-provision earnings is calculated by adding net interest income to noninterest income and subtracting noninterest expense. Management believes this is an important measure because it may enable investors to identify the trends in the Company's earnings exclusive of the effects of tax and provision expense, which may vary significantly from period to period. See reconciliation on the next page.
The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful to understanding the company's financial performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per share data).
The impact of the Paycheck Protection Program on Net Interest Margin FTE is provided below (dollars in thousands).
Net Income
Net income was $95.7 million in 2021, an increase of $11.4 million, or 13.5%, versus net income of $84.3 million in 2020. The increase in net income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $15.1 million, or 9.3%, and a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $13.7 million, or 92.7%. Noninterest expense increased $13.1 million, or 14.3%, and noninterest income decreased $2.1 million, or 4.5%. Net interest income for 2021 included $14.9 million in PPP interest and fee income compared to $12.8 million for 2020. The decrease in provision expense for 2021 was driven by improved economic conditions, which were supported by government stimulus programs and accommodative FOMC monetary policy.
Net income was $84.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 3.1%, versus net income of $87.0 million in 2019. The decrease in net income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses of $11.5 million, or 356.6%, as well as an increase of $1.8 million, or 2.0%, in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $8.0 million, or 5.1%, and noninterest income increased $1.8 million, or 4.1%. Net interest income for 2020 included $12.8 million in PPP interest and fee income. The increase in provision for credit losses was driven by the potential negative impact to the Company's borrowers due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net Interest Income
The following table presents a three-year average balance sheet and, for each major asset and liability category, its related interest income and yield or its expense and rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
THREE YEAR AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET AND NET INTEREST ANALYSIS
(1)Loan fees are included as taxable loan interest income. Net loan fees attributable to PPP loans were $12.5 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All other loan fees were immaterial in relation to total taxable loan interest income for the periods presented.
(2)Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance of taxable loans.
(3)Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (“TEFRA”) adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expenses. Taxable equivalent basis adjustments were $3.6 million, $2.4 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table shows fluctuations in net interest income attributable to changes in the average balances of assets and liabilities and the yields earned or rates paid for the years ended December 31.
NET INTEREST INCOME - RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS (fully tax equivalent basis, dollars in thousands)
(1)The earning assets and interest bearing liabilities used to calculate interest differentials are based on average daily balances for 2021, 2020 and 2019. The changes in net interest income are created by changes in interest rates and changes in the volumes of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. In the table above, changes attributable to volume are computed using the change in volume from the prior year multiplied by the previous year’s rate, and changes attributable to rate are computed using the change in rate from the prior year multiplied by the previous year’s volume. The change in interest or expense due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
(2)Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the TEFRA adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expense.
Net interest income increased by $15.1 million to $178.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a $721.8 million, or 13.9%, increase in average earning assets, driven by a $434.4 million increase in average available-for-sale investment securities and a $313.6 million increase in interest bearing deposits. The yield on average earning assets decreased 44 basis points to 3.33% in 2021 from 3.77% in 2020. The net interest margin decreased to 3.07% in 2021 versus 3.19% in 2020, driven by continued margin compression and excess liquidity on the Company's balance sheet. The net interest margin decreased to 3.19% in 2020 versus 3.38% in 2019, driven by the Federal Reserve Bank decreasing the target Federal Funds
Rate by 225 basis points since the second half of 2019, inclusive of two emergency cuts during March 2020, in response to the economic challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Growth in the commercial loan portfolio accounted for most of the growth in loans. Management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio, excluding the PPP loan program, will likely continue in a measured and prudent fashion as a result of our continued strategic focus on commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. Average total loans were flat at $4.421 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $4.424 billion at December 31, 2020. Average total loans, excluding PPP loans, were $4.183 billion at December 31, 2021 and represented growth of $135.5 million, or 3.3%, during 2021. Loan growth, excluding PPP loans, was slower in 2021 and 2020 as compared to prior years due to excess liquidity on our customers' balance sheets and a slowdown in demand for manufacturing and industrial loans. The utilization of commercial lines of credit has dropped in 2021 and 2020, due to softened loan demand, to 42% at December 31, 2021 from 43% at December 31, 2020 and 46% at December 31, 2019. However, available lines of credit have increased by a record $557 million to $4.101 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.544 billion at December 31, 2020. Management believes that tepid loan demand has impacted the decrease in commercial line utilization and believes its organic growth strategy of continued expansion in its current geographic footprint and in Indianapolis will provide continued loan growth opportunities.
During 2021 a reduction in average loans of $3.4 million, growth in average available-for-sale investment securities of $434.4 million and growth in average short-term investments and interest bearing deposits of $290.8 million was funded through an increase in deposits. Average demand deposits increased $361.3 million in 2021 and average interest bearing deposit accounts increased $345.4 million. The increase in deposits for 2021 resulted from excess liquidity on our customers’ balance sheets resulting from a combination of PPP and economic stimulus. As a result of this excess liquidity on the Company's balance sheet, management deployed $652 million into the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio during 2021.
Provision for Credit Losses
On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. This law extended relief for troubled debt restructurings and provided the opportunity to further delay CECL adoption originally provided under the CARES Act. The Company elected to defer adoption of CECL until January 1, 2021. Prior to this, provision expense was recorded under the incurred loss methodology. The day one impact of the adoption was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $9.1 million, with an offset, net of taxes, to beginning stockholders' equity.
The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.1 million in 2021 compared to $14.8 million in 2020 and $3.2 million in 2019. The lower provision in 2021 was driven by improvement in the financial condition and outlook of the Company's borrowers. The Company’s allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 was $67.8 million compared to $61.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and $50.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.58% of total loans as of December 31, 2021 versus 1.32% at December 31, 2020 and 1.25% at December 31, 2019. CECL adoption included a one-time increase to the allowance for credit losses of $9.1 million. The company’s credit loss reserve to total loans, excluding PPP loans, was 1.59% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.45% at December 31, 2020 and 1.25% at December 31, 2019. PPP loans are guaranteed by the United States SBA and have not been allocated for within the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs of $3.8 million, or 0.09% of average loans, and net charge-offs of $4.0 million, or 0.09% of average loans, were recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The charge offs for 2021 and 2020 resulted primarily from a single commercial credit each year. Management believes the charge offs were one-off instances and are not reflective of deteriorating trends in the loan portfolio. The Company’s management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels, asset quality, economic conditions including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans.
Noninterest Income
The following table presents changes in the components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31.
Noninterest income was $44.7 million in 2021 versus $46.8 million in 2020, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 4.5%. The decrease was primarily driven by a $4.1 million decrease in interest rate swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as a $2.5 million decrease in mortgage banking income. Demand for interest rate swap arrangements decreased in 2021. The carrying value of mortgage servicing rights was negatively impacted by increased prepayment speeds, resulting from the low interest rate environment. Offsetting these decreases were an increase in loan service fees of $1.8 million, an increases in wealth advisory and investment brokerage fees of $1.6 million, an increase in merchant and interchange fees of $615,000, and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $498,000. The increases in fee income were driven by growth in fee-based businesses including from the wealth advisory group, merchant services, debit card interchange and institutional services areas due to higher transaction volumes and increased economic activity.
Noninterest income was $46.8 million in 2020 versus $45.0 million in 2019, an increase of $1.8 million, or 4.1% higher. The increase was primarily driven by a record $3.4 million increase in interest rate swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as a $2.3 million increase in mortgage banking income. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by increase in wealth advisory fees due to continued growth of client relationships. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts driven primarily by lower treasury management fees as well as reduced levels of overdraft fee income.
Noninterest Expense
The following table presents changes in the components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31.
Noninterest expense increased by $13.1 million, or 14.3%, to $104.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $91.2 million for 2020. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $8.5 million due primarily to increased performace-based compensation, increased salaries and increased health insurance expense. Additionally, increased legal fees and costs associated with the digital platform conversion to LCB Digital contributed to an overall increase of $1.8 million in professional fees. Corporate and business development expenses increased as the 2021 economy re-opened, and client events and contributions increased in 2021.
Noninterest expense was $91.2 million in 2020 versus $89.4 million in 2019, an increase of $1.8 million, or 2.0%. Data processing fees increased $1.5 million in 2020 primarily due to the Company's continued investment in customer focused, technology-based solutions and ongoing cybersecurity and data management enhancements. FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased $1.1 million due to the expiration of insurance assessment credits and growth of the balance sheet. Professional fees increased by $670,000 primarily due to higher legal expenses, increased fees to accounting firms and professional fees for innovative project implementations. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to an increase in staffing at revenue producing and risk management areas as well as higher health insurance expenses. Offsetting these increases were decreases in corporate and business development as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation and postponement of events, in-person trainings and face-to-face customer and prospect meetings due to COVID-19 safety protocols. The Company spent approximately $640,000 since the pandemic began on personal protective equipment, protective barriers and enhanced social distancing measures for the safety of bank customers and employees.
As previously disclosed, in the third quarter of 2019, the Bank discovered potentially fraudulent activity by a former treasury management client involving multiple banks. The former client subsequently filed several related bankruptcy cases, captioned In re Interlogic Outsourcing, Inc., et al., which are pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Michigan. On April 27, 2021, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving an amended plan of liquidation, which was filed by the former client, other debtors and bankruptcy plan proponents, and approving the consolidation of the assets in the aforementioned cases under the Khan IOI Consolidated Estate Trust. On August 9, 2021, the liquidating trustee for the bankruptcy estates filed a complaint against the Bank and the Company, and has agreed to stay prosecution of the action through March 31, 2022. The action is focused on a series of business transactions among the client, related entities, and the Bank, which the liquidating trustee alleges are voidable under applicable federal bankruptcy and state law. The complaint also addresses treatment of the Bank’s claims filed in the bankruptcy cases. Based on current information, we have determined that a material loss is neither probable nor estimable at this time, and the Bank and the Company intend to vigorously defend themselves against all allegations asserted in the complaint.
Future noninterest expense may continue to be impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, continued economic reopening and growth may impact balance sheet growth and resulting revenue growth which could increase the amount the Company pays in incentive-based compensation. In addition, prolonged supply chain disruptions, labor availability shortages and increased infection rates due to COVID-19 variants could halt the economic recovery and resulting elevated provision expense which may reduce net income and diluted earnings per share, a key performance metric that impacts incentive-based compensation targets.
Income Taxes
The Company recognized income tax expense in 2021 of $21.7 million, compared to $19.5 million in 2020 and $20.3 million in 2019. The effective tax rate in 2021 was 18.5% compared to 18.8% in 2020, and 18.9% in 2019. For a detailed analysis of the Company’s income taxes see Note 13 - Income Taxes.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Overview
Total assets of the Company were $6.557 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $726.9 million, or 12.5%, when compared to $5.830 billion as of December 31, 2020. Total loans, excluding PPP loans, increased by $24.5 million, or 0.6%, as of December 31, 2021 from $4.237 billion at December 31, 2020. Total loans outstanding decreased by $361.3 million, or 7.8%, to $4.288 billion at December 31, 2021 from $4.649 billion at December 31, 2020. PPP loans outstanding were $26.2 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $412.0 million at December 31, 2020. The company received PPP forgiveness proceeds and borrowers' repayment of $709.5 million from the SBA for loans since the program's inception. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $433.3 million and available-for-sale securities increased by $663.7 million. Funding for the investment securities portfolio and organic loan growth came from a $698.6 million increase in total deposits as well as a $54.1 million increase in retained earnings, offset by an $10.5 million decrease in total borrowings.
Uses of Funds
Investment Portfolio
At year end 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government, government agencies and government sponsored agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity. See Note 2 - Securities for more information on these investments.
Purchases of securities available-for-sale totaled $835.0 million in 2021, $216.5 million in 2020 and $129.5 million in 2019. Growth of the investment portfolio during the past three years serves to provide liquidity for the Company and provide longer duration as an offset to the short duration of the loan portfolio. The Company deployed $652 million in excess liquidity into the investment securities portfolio during 2021 and $100 million in 2020 in order to preserve net interest income in the current rate and economic environment. Investment securities represented 21% of total assets on December 31, 2021 compared to 13% on December 31, 2020 and 12% on December 31, 2019. Management expects the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets to normalize once core loan growth demand increases and investment security repayments are deployed into loan growth. Securities sales totaled $14.0 million in 2021, $8.0 million in 2020 and $57.1 million in 2019. Paydowns from prepayments and scheduled payments of $113.1 million, $90.4 million and $53.0 million were received in 2021, 2020 and 2019, and the amortization of premiums, net of the accretion of discounts, was $5.0 million, $4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Maturities and calls of securities totaled $24.7 million, $7.6 million and $14.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No provision for allowance for credit loss was recorded in connection with the investment securities portfolio in 2021, and no other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in 2020 or 2019. The investment portfolio is managed to provide for an appropriate balance between liquidity, credit risk and investment return and to limit the Company’s exposure to risk to an acceptable level. The longer duration of the investment security portfolio serves to balance the shorter duration of the loan portfolio.
The weighted average yields and maturity distribution for the securities portfolio at December 31, 2021, were as follows:
The Company does not trade or invest in or sponsor certain unregistered investment companies defined as hedge funds and private equity funds in the Volcker Rule.
Real Estate Mortgage Loans Held For Sale
Real estate mortgages held for sale decreased by $3.7 million to $7.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $11.2 million at December 31, 2020 as a result of reduced mortgage refinancing demand compared to refinancing activity during 2020. This asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on, among other things, recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market. The Company generally sells almost all of the mortgage loans it originates in the secondary market. Proceeds from sales totaled $126.4 million in 2021, $114.2 million in 2020 and $64.8 million in 2019.
Loan Portfolio
The loan portfolio by class as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
The ratio of loans to total loans by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
In 2021, net loan balances decreased by $367.7 million to $4.220 billion, which excludes approximately $119.4 million in loans originated for sale. PPP loans of $26.2 million are included in non-working capital loans of commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2021. In 2020, net loan balances increased by $572.6 million to $4.588 billion, which excludes approximately $117.6 million in loans originated for sale. PPP loans of $412.0 million were included in non-working capital loans of commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2020. In 2019, net loan balances increased by $148.9 million to $4.015 billion, which excludes approximately $66.0 million in loans originated for sale.
The mix of loan types within the Company’s portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans. This higher percentage of commercial loans to the total portfolio was a result of the Company’s long standing strategic plan that is focused on organic expansion and growth in commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans together with owner occupied commercial real estate loans represent 49.6% and 52.4% of total loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The owner-occupied commercial real estate loans tend to represent the real estate holding of our commercial and industrial loan customers. Another significant loan segment are loans to the agri-business sector. During 2021, the Bank ranked as the third largest agricultural lender in the State of Indiana.
The residential construction and land development loans class included construction loans totaling $3.3 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Declines in consumer loans during 2021 resulted from paydowns due to borrower excess liquidity generated from mortgage refinancing activity and government stimulus programs. The Bank generally sells conforming mortgage loans which it originates on the secondary market. These loans generally represent mortgage loans that are made to clients with long-term or substantial relationships with the Bank on terms consistent with secondary market requirements. The loan classifications are based on the nature of the loans as of the loan origination date. There were no foreign loans included in the loan portfolio for the periods presented.
Repricing opportunities of the loan portfolio occur either according to predetermined float rate indices, adjustable rate schedules included in the related loan agreements or upon maturity of each principal payment. The following table indicates the scheduled maturities of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021:
At maturity, credits are reviewed and, if renewed, are renewed at rates and conditions that prevail at the time of maturity.
Based upon the table above, all loans due after one year which have a predetermined interest rate and loans due after one year which have floating or adjustable interest rates as of December 31, 2021 amounted to $1.241 billion and $1.824 billion, respectively.
Paycheck Protection Program
During 2020 and the first half of 2021, the Bank funded PPP loans totaling $735.6 million for its customers through the PPP programs. In addition, the Bank processed forgiveness applications for PPP loans representing 97% of loans originated. As of December 31, 2021, PPP loans outstanding, net of deferred fees, totaled $26.2 million; $3.8 million from PPP round one and $22.3 million from PPP round two. As of December 31, 2021, the SBA has approved forgiveness of, or borrowers repaid, $709.5 million in PPP loans; $566.7 million for PPP loans originated during round one and $142.8 million for PPP loans originated during round two. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had submitted additional PPP forgiveness applications on behalf of customers in the amount of $8.3 million that were awaiting SBA approval.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
Bank owned life insurance increased by $2.4 million to $97.7 million at December 31, 2021 and by $11.4 million to $95.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $83.8 million at December 31, 2019. The increase during 2021 was primarily due to investment returns on the life insurance policies of pre-existing life insurance policies. The increase during 2020 was primarily due to the purchase of additional life insurance policies on officers of the Bank. Bank owned life insurance provides investment income from the securities the life insurance is invested in and offsets benefit plan expenses for participants covered by insurance.
Sources of Funds
The average daily deposits and borrowings together with the average rates paid on those deposits and borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are summarized in the following table:
Time deposits as of December 31, 2021 will mature as follows:
Deposits
Total deposits increased by $698.6 million to $5.735 billion, comparing December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020. The increase in deposits consisted of growth of $703.6 million in core deposit combined with a decrease of $5.0 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $321.9 million, or 16.6%, in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $259.5 million, or 13.5%, while public funds deposits increased by $122.2 million, or 10.5%. PPP loan proceeds to borrowers and government stimulus to consumers impacted the increase in deposit during 2021 as loan proceeds and stimulus payments were deposited into customer checking and savings accounts at the Bank. Proceeds from the sale of customer businesses also contributed to the increase of deposits during 2021.
Total deposits increased by $903.0 million to $5.037 billion, comparing December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits consisted of $1.002 billion in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $98.5 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $664.3 million, or 52.1%, in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $301.9 million, or 18.7%, while public funds deposits increased by $35.3 million, or 3.1%. The growth in deposits in 2020 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Deposit growth was impacted by excess liquidity on customer balance sheets resulting from PPP loans, due to both economic stimulus payments made to retail customers and an increase in savings rates. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2020 and 2021.
As previously noted, 22% of the Company’s deposit base is attributable to public fund entities which primarily represent customers in the Company’s geographic footprint. A majority of public fund balances represent customers with operating accounts at the Bank. A shift in funding away from public fund deposits could require the Company to execute alternative funding plans under the Contingency Funding Plan discussed in further detail under “Liquidity Risk” below. The following table presents total deposits by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings
During 2021, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $33.9 million to $408,000, primarily due to lower short-term FHLB borrowings and lower usage of the Company's holding company line of credit. Ending balances of short-term and miscellaneous borrowings decreased $10.5 million during 2021 to $0. The decrease was due to the payoff of the Company's holding company line of credit which was used in connection with its share repurchase activity during 2020. The holding company's line repayment was funded by a dividend from the Bank. There was no share repurchase activity during 2021.
Short-term FHLB borrowings are used to fund short-term balance sheet growth due to the flexible nature of the financial instrument and allow the Company to prudently fund commercial or retail loans when opportunities are presented. Average total long-term borrowings increased by $12.7 million to $75.0 million, due to a $75.0 million long-term FHLB borrowing taken in 2020 that was outstanding for all of 2021.
During 2020, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $27.0 million to $34.3 million, primarily due to the payoff of outstanding short-term FHLB borrowings. During 2020, the Company utilized $10.5 million of the holding company's $30.0 million revolving line of credit in connection with its share repurchase activity. Average total long-term borrowings increased by $31.5 million to $62.3 million, primarily due to a $75.0 million long-term FHLB borrowing offset by the repayment of the Company's subordinated debentures in December 2019.
Capital
The Company believes that a strong, appropriately managed capital position is critical to support continued growth of loans and earnings. Capital is used primarily to fund continued organic loan growth and to support dividends to shareholders. The Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.4%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 14.1% and a common Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.1% as of December 31, 2021. These ratios met or exceeded the Federal Reserve Bank’s “well-capitalized” minimums of 10.0%, 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively. The Company also had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.7% and a tangible equity ratio of 10.7%. See Note 16 - Capital Requirements for more information.
The ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy. Total stockholders’ equity increased by 7.3% to $704.9 million as of December 31, 2021 from $657.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company earned $95.7 million in 2021 and $84.3 million in 2020. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.36 per share in 2021, which decreased equity by $34.7 million. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.20 per share in 2020, which decreased equity by $30.6 million. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2021
was due to changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities and the defined benefit pension which decreased equity by $11.7 million in 2021 compared to an increase of $15.7 million in 2020. The impact to equity due to other comprehensive income (loss) is not included in regulatory capital. In addition, during March of 2020 the Company repurchased 289,101 shares of its common stock for $10.0 million.
