Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing the next-generation of precision oncology medicines that inhibit DNA damage repair and cause cancer cell death in specific subsets of cancer patients through a therapeutic strategy known as synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality is a clinically validated approach to drug development and arises when the occurrence of two cellular conditions is lethal when occurring simultaneously but tolerated when occurring individually.
Our lead program, CYT-0851 was designed to exploit a novel synthetic lethality between overexpression of a family of DNA damaging enzymes called cytidine deaminases, or CD, and functional inhibition of homologous recombination, or HR, a DNA repair pathway critical for the survival of some cancers. We observed preliminary single-agent activity in the dose-escalation phase 1 portion of our phase 1/2 trial, which we completed in November 2021. In January 2022, we initiated patient dosing with CYT-0851 in the phase 2 expansion cohort portion of the phase 1/2 trial in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we could initiate a potentially registrational trial in early 2023 for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory lymphoma and/or solid tumors. We also plan to develop CYT-0851 in additional tumor settings as both a monotherapy and in combination with approved cancer therapeutics. In January 2022, we initiated patient dosing in the phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 trial to assess tolerability and preliminary activity of combinations with three standard-of-care therapies.
Since our inception in 2012, we have focused primarily on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and performing research and development of novel therapeutics. We do not have any drug candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and have raised an aggregate of approximately $141.0 million of gross proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and approximately $149.1 million of gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering, as of December 31, 2021.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, including net losses of $42.1 million and $20.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $92.1 million and $49.9 million, respectively. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future as we:
•continue the research and development of our drug candidates;
•initiate and conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our drug candidates;
•further develop and refine the manufacturing processes for our drug candidates;
•seek regulatory approvals and pursue commercialization for any of our drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•seek to identify and validate additional drug candidates and their associated biomarkers;
•obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;
•seek to attract and retain new and existing skilled personnel;
•acquire or in-license other drug candidates and technologies;
•create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and incur increased legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses; and
•experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above.
We will not generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our drug candidates, if ever. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $189.7 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
COVID-19 business update
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we established a cross-functional task force and have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business, including our clinical trials. Our operations are considered an essential business and we have been allowed to continue operating under current governmental restrictions during this period. We have taken measures to secure our research and development activities, while our work in laboratories and facilities has been organized to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our clinical trial enrollment, trial sites, contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. While we are experiencing limited financial impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, our business, financial condition and results of operations ultimately could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as we evolve our business continuity plans, clinical development plans and response strategy.
Components of results of operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. If our development efforts for our drug candidates and preclinical programs are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales.
Operating expenses
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development and manufacture of our drug candidates, and include:
•personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation and other related costs for individuals involved in research and development activities;
•external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and other scientific development services;
•costs incurred under agreements with CMOs for developing and manufacturing material for our preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements;
•costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing study materials; and
•facilities and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, insurance and other operating costs.
Costs for external development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis after a clinical drug candidate has been identified. Our internal research and development costs are primarily personnel-related costs, internal lab costs and other indirect costs. The majority of our external research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with CYT-0851.
We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources and third-party consultants primarily to conduct our research and discovery activities as well as for managing our process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities.
The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. We plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue our existing clinical trial, initiate future clinical trials for our drug candidates and continue to discover and develop additional drug candidates. Therefore, while we expect our research and development expenses to be higher in 2022 than in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our future drug candidates. Our level of costs may be highly variable on a quarterly basis. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of CYT-0851 or potential future drug candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drug candidates, including the uncertainty of:
•the scope, rate of progress and expenses of our ongoing research activities and clinical trials and other research and development activities;
•successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;
•establishing an appropriate safety profile;
•whether our drug candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;
•receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;
•commercializing drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our drug candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these drug candidates. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that drug candidate.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions.
General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our drug candidates.
Other income
Interest income
Other income includes interest income, which consists of interest earned on cash equivalents that generate interest on a monthly basis.
Results of operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations:
Research and development expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development costs for each of the periods presented:
Research and development expenses were $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which increased by $14.2 million from $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the following:
•a $8.5 million increase in costs related to our RAD51-mediated HR inhibitor programs driven by the continued development of CYT-0851, our lead drug candidate, specifically due to the advancement of our ongoing clinical trial, as well as preclinical costs related to CYT-1853;
•a $3.5 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount; and
•a $2.2 million increase in other research and development operational expenses, including facilities and lab-related costs as well as costs related to our discovery efforts.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which increased by $7.1 million, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the following:
•a $3.8 million increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount; and
•a $3.3 million increase other general and administrative expenses, including professional fees, insurance, facilities, IT services and rent, primarily related to the costs associated with operating as a public company after our initial public offer ("IPO") in June 2021.
Total other income
Total other income was $0.1 million for both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and consists primarily of interest income. The interest income in both periods related to our cash equivalents, which are primarily invested in money market funds.
Liquidity and capital resources
Sources of liquidity
Since our inception, we have not recognized any product revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all.
We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and the sale of common stock in connection with the completion of the IPO. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have raised an aggregate of approximately $141.0 million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $136.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock.
Funding requirements
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $189.7 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend our capital resources sooner than we expect.
We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and pursue commercialization of any approved drug candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with our planned research and development activities. In addition, since the completion of our IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. If we receive regulatory approval for any of our other drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize. We may also require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other drug candidates.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the continuation, timing, costs, progress and results of our planned clinical trials of CYT-0851;
•the progress of preclinical development and possible clinical trials of our earlier-stage programs;
•the scope, progress, results and costs of our research programs and preclinical development of any additional drug candidates that we may pursue;
•the development requirements of other drug candidates that we may pursue;
•the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other regulatory authorities;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our drug candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the cost of expanding, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio, including filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
•the cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or any of our drug candidates;
•the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, drug candidates or technologies;
•the extent to which the impact of COVID-19 or other pandemics may delay the development of our drug candidates;
•our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development, increase our office space, and establish a commercial infrastructure; and
•the ongoing costs of operating as a public company.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and other similar arrangements. We are not currently eligible to file a shelf registration statement; however, we believe that shelf registration statements can contribute, when used, to greater financing flexibility. To that end, we plan to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC once we are eligible to do so. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common shareholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our drug candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such drug candidates ourselves.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:
Operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $36.0 million, primarily due to our net loss of $42.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $4.0 million and a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. The non-cash charges consist of stock-based compensation expense of $3.5 million and depreciation expense of $0.5 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in accrued expenses and a $2.2 million increase in prepaid expense and other current assets.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $18.5 million, primarily due to our net loss of $20.8 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of depreciation expense of $0.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $1.0 million increase in our accounts payable, $0.1 million increase in accrued expenses, a $0.1 million increase in deferred rent and $0.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and resulted from our purchases of property and equipment.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of $136.1 million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon our IPO, $79.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock in February 2021 and $0.2 million from stock option exercises.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, relating to stock option exercises, including $0.8 million from early exercises of stock options.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules and regulations.
Contractual obligations and commitments
Lease commitments
Operating lease payments represent our commitments for future minimum rent made under non-cancelable lease for our rental space in Lexington, Massachusetts. The total payments for our operating lease obligations at December 31, 2021 is $3.6 million, of which $0.9 million is due in the next twelve months and the remaining payments are due over the term of the lease. For additional details regarding our lease, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
Purchase and other obligations
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and other third-party vendors for clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. Most contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancellable by us upon written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service provided up to one year after the date of cancellation.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid balance accordingly.
Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Stock-Based compensation
We account for all share-based compensation awards granted as stock-based compensation expense at fair value. Our share-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, restricted for vesting conditions. The measurement date for awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the accompanying statements of operations based on the function to which the related services are provided. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for the portion of awards that have vested. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur.
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected share price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. Since there is limited historical data of our share price on the public market, we determined the volatility for awards granted based on an analysis of reported data for a group of guideline companies that issued options with substantially similar terms. The expected term of our stock options granted to employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected volatility has been determined using a weighted-average of the historical volatility measures of this group of guideline companies.
The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, dividends on our common shares; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.
Determination of the fair value of common stock
As there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock prior to the IPO was determined by our board of directors considering the valuations of our company’s enterprise value prepared by a third-party valuation firm, and in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. These third-party valuations utilized either an option pricing method, or OPM, or a hybrid method, both of which used market approaches to estimate our enterprise value. The market approaches utilized in these valuations were based on the subject company transaction method if our company had completed a recent arm’s-length securities transaction, or the guideline public company method if no arm’s-length securities transaction was completed near the time that the valuation was performed. The subject company transaction method considers the value based on prior transactions of the subject company, and the guideline public company method relies on analysis of publicly traded companies in the same industry or which have similar operating characteristics to the subject company. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack of marketability of the common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. The hybrid method is a probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, where the equity value in one or more scenarios is calculated using an OPM. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of common stock based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The estimates of fair value of common stock resulting from each scenario are weighted based on the expected likelihood of each outcome. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each share class. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.
In addition to considering the results of the third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date prior to the IPO, which may have been a date later than the most recent third-party valuation date, including:
•the prices at which we sold preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;
•the progress of our research and development efforts, including the status of preclinical studies and ongoing and planned clinical trials for our RAD51-mediated HR inhibitor programs;
•the lack of liquidity of our equity as a private company;
•our stage of development and business strategy and the material risks related to our business and industry;
•the achievement of enterprise milestones;
•the valuation of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed mergers and acquisitions of peer companies;
•any external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry;
•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our preferred stock and common stock, such as an IPO, or a sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions; and
•the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.
There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in these valuations. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. Following the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
Recent accounting pronouncements
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.
Emerging growth company status
We are an “emerging growth company,” or EGC, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as private entities.
As an EGC, we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC:
•we may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;
•we may avail ourselves of the exemption from providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•we may avail ourselves of the exemption from complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis;
•we may provide reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
•we may not require nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments.
We will remain an EGC until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous rolling three-year period or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
