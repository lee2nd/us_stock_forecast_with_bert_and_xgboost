Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis for the Three-Year Period Ended December 31, 2021
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As stipulated in the Trust Agreement, the Trust is intended to be passive in nature and the Trustee does not have any control over or any responsibility relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. The Trustee has powers to collect and distribute proceeds received by the Trust and pay Trust liabilities and expenses and its actions have been limited to those activities. The Trust is a passive entity and other than the Trust’s ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses, liabilities and obligations of the Trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the Trust, the Trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions. As a result, other than such borrowings, if any, the Trust has no source of liquidity or capital resources other than the Royalties.
Results of Operations
Royalty income received by the Trust for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, is reported in the following table:
Royalty income of the Trust for the calendar year is associated with actual oil and gas production for the period November of the prior year through October of the current year. Oil and gas production for 2021, 2020 and 2019 generated by the Royalties and the Underlying Properties, excluding portions attributable to the adjustments discussed hereafter, are presented in the following table:
The average price of oil increased to $63.34 per barrel in 2021, up from $39.51 per barrel in 2020. The average price of oil in 2019 was $51.74 per barrel. In addition, the average price of gas increased from $1.47 per Mcf in 2020 to $3.43 per Mcf in 2021. The average price of gas in 2019 was $2.64 per Mcf. Oil prices have increased primarily because of world market conditions. Oil prices are expected to remain volatile. Gas liquids values remain stronger and keep the prices of gas stronger. Blackbeard, after assuming the role of operation of the Waddell Ranch Properties, immediately instituted a workover of specific wells, which cause the Trust not to receive any royalty income from the Waddell Properties in 2021.
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the price of both oil and gas continued to fluctuate, giving rise to a correlating adjustment of the respective standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. As of March 15, 2022, NYMEX posted oil prices were approximately $96.44 per barrel, which compared to the posted price of $66.56 per barrel, used to calculate the worth of future net revenue of the Trust’s proved developed reserves, would result in a larger standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for oil. As of March 15, 2022, NYMEX posted gas prices were $4.46 per million British thermal units. The use of such price, as compared to the posted price of $3.65 per million British thermal units, used to calculate the future net revenue of the Trust’s proved developed reserves would result in a larger standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for gas.
Since the oil and gas sales attributable to the Royalties are based on an allocation formula that is dependent on such factors as price and cost (including capital expenditures), production amounts do not necessarily provide a meaningful comparison. For the underlying properties total oil production increased by approximately 50% from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to additional production on Waddell due to new drilling. For the underlying properties total gas production increased approximately 46% from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the new drilling and updated gas plant facility.
Total capital expenditures in 2021 used in the net overriding royalty calculation were approximately $66.6 million (gross) compared to $10.3 million (gross) in 2020 and $3.3 million (gross) in 2019. The operator of the Waddell Ranch properties has informed the Trustee that, in order to halt the production decline curve and to exploit the remaining potential of the Trust’s assets more fully, a more aggressive, robust capital expenditure budget will be necessary in the future and is being pursued.
In 2020, there were 3 recompletion wells completed and 21 wells permanently plugged on the Waddell Ranch properties. Actual costs for this program in 2020 approximated $10.3 million (gross). This cost is for the development program and base facilities. In 2021, there were 28 new drill wells and 47 recompletion.
Texas law requires all temporarily abandoned wells to be either worked over and recompleted to functional status or permanently plugged and abandoned within a five year time frame. The Waddell Ranch properties contain over 700 such temporarily abandoned wells. In 2021, there were 47 recompletion wells completed and 20 wells permanently plugged on the Waddell Ranch properties.
There were 79 gross (20 net) drill wells completed on the Waddell Ranch properties during 2021. At December 31, 2020, there were 4 drill wells and 3 workover in progress on the Waddell Ranch properties.
Blackbeard has advised the Trustee that the proposed budget for 2022 will be $245 million (gross) and $92 (net). The 2022 budget will include amounts to be spent on 34 (net) vertical wells, targeting the “WolfBone” formations, 13 (net) horizontal wells targeting the Sandhills and McKnight formations, along with various other recompleted wells prospects to be worked over and completed, and also amounts to be spent on additional facilities and infrastructure improvements and the completion of projects begun in 2021. Because the wide volatility of the pricing for both oil and gas in the current market, Blackbeard could not make any accurate projections as to the anticipated revenue streams or production levels of both the 2021 and projected 2022 budget projects.
In 2021, lease operating expense and property taxes on the Waddell Ranch properties amounted to approximately $23 million, compared to approximately $19.6 million in 2020 and approximately $23.4 million in 2019.
The Trustee has been advised by the operator that since June 2006, the oil from the Waddell Ranch has been marketed by the operator by soliciting bids from third parties on an outright sale basis of production listed in bid packages.
During 2021, the monthly royalty receipts were invested by the Trustee in cash and cash equivalents until the monthly distribution date, and earned interest totaled $5,112. Interest income for 2020 and 2019 was $9,603 and $23,000, respectively.
General and administrative expenses in 2021 were $1,088,851 compared to $1,041,303 in 2020 and $1,089,302 in 2019, primarily due to audit of properties and other professional services. The reserve for administrative expenses for any potentially extraordinary events and/or expenses was $1,100,000 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Total reserves for expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $0, $50,000 and $0, respectively.
Distributable income for 2021 was $10,721,775 or $0.23 per Unit.
Distributable income for 2020 was $10,958,618 or $0.24 per Unit.
Distributable income for 2019 was $19,421,131 or $0.42 per Unit.
Results of the Fourth Quarters of 2021 and 2020
Royalty income received by the Trust for the fourth quarter of 2021 amounted to $3,396,125 or $0.07 per Unit. For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Trust received royalty income of $1,980,417 or $0.04 per Unit. Interest income for the fourth quarter of 2021 amounted to $1,253 compared to $1,539 for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in interest income can be attributed primarily to an increase of funds available. Total general and administrative expenses was $157,516 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $135,434 for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in expenses primarily related to timing of payments of legal and auditor expenses.
Royalty income for the Trust for the fourth quarter is associated with actual oil and gas production during August through October from the Underlying Properties. Oil and gas production attributable to the Underlying Properties for the quarter and the comparable period for 2020 are as follows:
The posted price of oil increased for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in an average price per barrel of $72.44 compared to $37.91 in the same period of 2020. The average price of gas increased for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, resulting in an average price per Mcf of $4.85 compared to $2.14 in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Trustee has been advised that oil and gas production increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to additional drilling.
The Trust has been advised that 22.6 wells were drilled and completed during the three months ended December 31, 2021, and there were 8.2 wells in progress.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the basis of accounting described above requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as of and for the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from such estimates.
Impairment
The Trustee routinely reviews its royalty interests in oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of the Trust’s royalty interests may not be recoverable, an impairment will be recognized as measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the royalty interests exceeds the fair value of these assets, which would likely be measured by discounting projected cash flows. There was no impairment of the assets as of December 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Trust’s financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require the Trust to make significant estimates and assumptions. The following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Trust’s financial condition and results of operations.
1. Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis:
•
Royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust by the interest owners. Royalty income consists of the amounts received by the owners of the interest burdened by the Royalties from the sale of production less accrued production costs, development and drilling costs, applicable taxes, operating charges and other costs and deductions multiplied by 75% in the case of the Waddell Ranch properties and 95% in the case of the Texas Royalty properties.
•
Trust expenses, consisting principally of routine general and administrative costs, recorded are based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established out of cash received or borrowed funds for liabilities and contingencies.
•
Distributions to Unit holders are recorded when declared by the Trustee.
•
Royalty income is computed separately for each of the conveyances under which the Royalties were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance (“excess costs”), such excess costs cannot reduce royalty income from other conveyances, but is carried forward with accrued interest to be recovered from future net proceeds of that conveyance.
The financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) because revenues are not accrued in the month of production and certain cash reserves may be established for contingencies which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Amortization of the Royalties calculated on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly to trust corpus. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.
2. Royalty Income
Revenues from Royalty Interests are recognized in the period in which amounts are received by the Trust. Royalty income received by the Trust in a given calendar year will generally reflect the proceeds from crude oil and natural gas produced for the twelve-month period ended October 31st in that calendar year.
3. Reserve Disclosure
Independent petroleum engineers estimate the net proved reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests. Estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves have been prepared using average 12-month oil and gas
prices, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month benchmark price for each month within the 12-month period preceding the end of the most recent fiscal year, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is achieved by using a discount rate of 10% a year to reflect the timing of future cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from the reserve estimates and related costs. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production rates and the timing of development of non-producing reserves. Such reserve estimates are subject to change as market conditions change.
Detailed information concerning the number of wells on royalty properties is not generally available to the owner of royalty interests. Consequently, the Registrant does not have information that would be disclosed by a company with oil and gas operations, such as an accurate account of the number of wells located on its royalty properties, the number of exploratory or development wells drilled on its royalty properties during the periods presented by this report, or the number of wells in process or other present activities on its royalty properties, and the Registrant cannot readily obtain such information.
4. Contingencies
Contingencies related to the Underlying Properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally be reflected by the Trust as reductions to future royalty income payments to the Trust with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders.
New Accounting Pronouncements
There are no new pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on the Trust’s financial statements.
