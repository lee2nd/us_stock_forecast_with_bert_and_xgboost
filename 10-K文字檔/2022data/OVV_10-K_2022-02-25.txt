Highlights
During 2021, the Company focused on executing its 2021 capital plan aimed at maximizing profitability through operational and capital efficiencies, delivering cash from operating activities and using excess cash flows to reduce total long-term debt. Higher upstream product revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted from higher average realized prices, excluding the impact of risk management activities. Increases in average realized natural gas and liquids prices of 91 percent and 90 percent, respectively, were primarily due to higher benchmark prices. Ovintiv continues to focus on optimizing realized prices from the diversification of the Company’s downstream markets.
The Company continued to deliver significant cash from operating activities while reducing its total long-term debt balance. Cash from operating activities of $3,129 million included a net realized loss of $1,362 million on the settlement of commodity and foreign exchange risk management positions and a current income tax recovery of $156 million primarily due to the resolution of prior years’ tax items. The Company used excess cash flows to reduce its total long-term debt balance by $2.1 billion in 2021.

2022 Outlook
Industry Outlook
Oil Markets
The oil and gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices are inherently volatile. Oil prices reflect global supply and demand dynamics as well as the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment.
In 2021, OPEC+ production cuts and increased global demand for oil resulted in upward pressures on oil prices and the tightening of global oil inventories. Oil prices during 2022 will continue to be impacted by the global containment of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), pace of economic recovery, OPEC+ production levels, and the potential for higher U.S. production.
COVID-19 vaccine rollout/uptake continues to drive optimism, however, emerging COVID-19 variants may impact economic progress while the gradual easing of OPEC+ oil production cuts, the potential for higher U.S. oil production, and macroeconomic risks could contribute to commodity market uncertainty. Since the second quarter of 2021, OPEC+ has gradually increased production in response to increases in oil demand. OPEC+ continues to meet regularly to review the state of global oil supply, demand and inventory levels, and is expected to continue with its planned production increases in 2022.
Natural Gas Markets
Natural gas prices are primarily affected by structural changes in supply and demand as well as deviations from seasonally normal weather. In 2021, supportive weather conditions, limited supply growth from U.S. producers and increased electricity usage contributed to increased drawdowns of natural gas inventory and higher natural gas prices. Natural gas prices in 2022 are expected to be impacted by the interplay between gas production and associated gas from oil production, as well as changes in demand from the power generation sector, changes in export levels of liquified natural gas and impacts from seasonal weather.
Company Outlook
The Company continues to exercise discretion and discipline to optimize capital allocation throughout 2022 as oil demand recovers and the commodity price environment evolves. Ovintiv pursues innovative ways to reduce upstream operating and administrative expenses and expects to benefit from durable cost savings and efficiencies to maximize cash flows.
Markets for crude oil and natural gas are exposed to different price risks and are inherently volatile. While the market price for crude oil tends to move in the same direction as the global market, regional differentials may develop. Natural gas prices may vary between geographic regions depending on local supply and demand conditions. To mitigate price volatility and help sustain revenues, particularly during periods of low commodity prices, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments. As at December 31, 2021, the Company has hedged approximately 80.0 Mbbls/d of expected oil and condensate production and 1,293 MMcf/d of expected natural gas production for 2022. In addition, Ovintiv proactively utilizes transportation contracts to diversify the Company’s sales markets, thereby reducing significant exposure to any given market and regional pricing.
Additional information on Ovintiv’s hedging program can be found in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Capital Investment
The Company plans to spend approximately $1.5 billion on its 2022 capital investment program. The majority of this capital program is expected to be allocated to the Core Assets with a focus on maximizing returns from high margin liquids. In 2022, the Company expects to generate cash flows in excess of capital expenditures.
Ovintiv continually strives to improve well performance and lower costs through innovative techniques. Initiatives such as applying Simul-Frac techniques, a process of fracking pairs of wells at the same time instead of a single well, increases operational efficiencies and contributes to well cost savings. Ovintiv's large-scale cube development
model utilizes multi-well pads and advanced completion designs to maximize returns and resource recovery from its reservoirs. Ovintiv’s disciplined capital program and continuous innovation create flexibility to allocate capital in changing commodity markets and to maximize cash flows while preserving the long-term value of the Company’s multi-basin portfolio.
Production
Ovintiv is strategically positioned in the current economic environment to maintain a flat liquids production profile while generating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures.
In 2022, the Company expects average oil and plant condensate production volumes of approximately 180.0 Mbbls/d to 190.0 Mbbls/d, other NGLs production volumes of approximately 78.0 Mbbls/d to 82.0 Mbbls/d and natural gas production volumes of approximately 1,450 MMcf/d to 1,500 MMcf/d.
Operating Expenses
The Company continues to benefit from cost savings measures implemented in 2020 which included workforce reductions and operating efficiencies. With rising activity in the oil and gas industry and the recovery of commodity prices, service and supply costs are expected to increase. Ovintiv continues to pursue innovative ways to reduce upstream operating and administrative expenses, and strives to minimize any inflationary pressures with efficiency improvements and effective supply chain management.
Total Costs per BOE is expected to increase for 2022 primarily due to higher production taxes resulting from expected strengthening of commodity prices and higher transportation and processing costs. For 2022, Ovintiv expects Total Costs of approximately $14.75 per BOE to $15.25 per BOE. Total Costs is defined in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD&A.
Long-Term Debt Reduction
Ovintiv remains focused on strengthening its balance sheet. Since the second quarter of 2020, the Company has allocated $2,580 million in excess cash flows to reduce its total long-term debt balance, which included proceeds from the Duvernay and Eagle Ford asset divestitures. The Company expects to achieve its Net Debt balance of $3.0 billion in the second half of 2022, assuming commodity prices of $85.00 per barrel for WTI oil and $4.50 per MMBtu for NYMEX natural gas.
In June 2021, the Company redeemed its $600 million, 5.75 percent senior notes due January 30, 2022, and in August 2021, redeemed its $518 million, 3.90 percent senior notes due November 15, 2021. The combined debt redemptions will result in annualized interest savings of over $50 million.
As at December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding balances under its revolving credit facilities and U.S. dollar commercial paper programs.
Additional information on Ovintiv’s long-term debt and liquidity position can be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A, respectively.
Additional information on Ovintiv’s 2022 Corporate Guidance can be accessed on the Company’s website at www.ovintiv.com.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Ovintiv recognizes the importance of reducing its environmental footprint and voluntarily participates in emission reduction programs. The Company has adopted a range of strategies to help reduce emissions from its operations. These strategies include incorporating new and proven technologies and optimizing processes in its drilling and completions operations, and working closely with third-party providers to develop best practices. The Company continues to look for innovative techniques and efficiencies to help maintain its commitment to emission reductions.
As of September 1, 2021, the Company is in alignment with the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring initiative, nine years ahead of the World Bank’s target date of 2030. Ovintiv does not engage in routine flaring by ensuring natural gas gathering infrastructure is in place for all of its producing wells.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company exceeded its targeted 33 percent reduction in methane emissions intensity four years ahead of schedule and achieved a greater than 20 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity compared to 2019 levels. In 2022, the Company announced a further GHG emissions intensity reduction target of 50 percent compared to 2019 levels, to be achieved by 2030. This new emissions reduction target is also tied to its annual compensation program for all employees.
Ovintiv is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2021, the Company developed a new social commitment framework, which is rooted in the Company’s foundational values of integrity, safety, sustainability, trust and respect. The framework focuses on respecting stakeholders, strengthening communities and fostering a culture of inclusion.
Ovintiv remains committed to protecting the health and safety of its workforce. Safety is a foundational value at Ovintiv and plays a critical role in the Company’s belief that a safe workplace is a strong indicator of a well-managed business. This safety-oriented mindset enables the Company to quickly respond to emergencies and minimize any impacts to employees and business continuity. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ovintiv established a Pandemic Response Team to continually assess the impact of COVID-19 and develop protocols and procedures to maintain a safe working environment for its staff. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, the Company reported its eighth consecutive safest year in 2021.

Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization
Proved properties within each country cost centre are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depletion rates are impacted by impairments, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rates, as well as fluctuations in 12-month average trailing prices which affect proved reserves volumes. Corporate assets are carried at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the assets.
Additional information can be found under Upstream Assets and Reserve Estimates in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A.
2021 versus 2020
DD&A decreased $644 million compared to 2020 primarily due to:
•
Lower depletion rates in the USA and Canadian Operations ($448 million and $144 million, respectively) and lower production volumes in USA Operations ($93 million), partially offset by higher U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate ($32 million) and higher production volumes in the Canadian Operations ($19 million).
The depletion rate in the USA Operations decreased $4.10 per BOE compared to 2020 primarily due to the ceiling test impairments recognized in 2020 and the sale of the Eagle Ford assets in the second quarter of 2021. The depletion rate in the Canadian Operations decreased $1.32 per BOE compared to 2020 primarily due to the sale of the Duvernay assets in the second quarter of 2021.
Impairments
Under full cost accounting, the carrying amount of Ovintiv’s oil and natural gas properties within each country cost centre is subject to a ceiling test performed quarterly. Ceiling test impairments are recognized when the capitalized costs, net of accumulated depletion and the related deferred income taxes, exceed the sum of the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from proved reserves as calculated under SEC requirements using the 12-month average trailing prices and discounted at 10 percent. The 12-month average trailing price is calculated as the average of the price on the first day of each month within the trailing 12-month period.
In 2021, the Company did not recognize ceiling test impairments (2020 - $5,580 million before tax, in the USA Operations). The non-cash ceiling test impairments in 2020 primarily resulted from the decline in the 12-month average trailing prices, which reduced proved reserves.
The 12-month average trailing prices used in the ceiling test calculations were based on the benchmark prices below. The benchmark prices were adjusted for basis differentials to determine local reference prices, transportation costs and tariffs, heat content and quality.

All prices were held constant in all future years when estimating net revenues and reserves.
The Company believes that the discounted after-tax future net cash flows from proved reserves required to be used in the ceiling test calculation are not indicative of the fair market value of Ovintiv’s oil and natural gas properties or the future net cash flows expected to be generated from such properties. The discounted after-tax future net cash flows do not consider the fair market value of unamortized unproved properties, or probable or possible liquids and natural gas reserves. In addition, there is no consideration given to the effect of future changes in commodity prices. Ovintiv manages its business using estimates of reserves and resources based on forecast prices and costs. Additional information on the ceiling test calculation can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Administrative
Administrative expense represents costs associated with corporate functions provided by Ovintiv staff. Costs primarily include salaries and benefits, operating lease, office, information technology, restructuring and long-term incentive costs.
(1)
Includes costs related to The Bow office lease of $117 million (2020 - $110 million), half of which is recovered from sublease revenues.
(2)
Total Administrative costs for 2021 reflects a higher U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate of $13 million.
2021 versus 2020
Administrative expense increased $47 million compared to 2020 primarily due to:
•
Higher long-term incentive costs resulting from an increase in the Company’s share price in 2021 compared to a decrease in 2020 ($84 million) and higher legal and consulting costs ($28 million);
partially offset by:
•
A decrease in restructuring costs related to workforce reductions in 2020 ($76 million).
During 2020, the Company completed workforce reductions as part of a company-wide reorganization in response to the low commodity price environment resulting from the global pandemic and the Company’s planned reductions in capital spending. Additional information on restructuring charges and long-term incentive costs can be found in Notes 21 and 22, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other (Income) Expenses
Interest
Interest expense primarily includes interest on Ovintiv’s long-term debt. Additional information on changes in interest can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
2021 versus 2020
Interest expense decreased $31 million compared to 2020 primarily due to:
•
The redemption of the Company’s 2021 and 2022 senior notes ($25 million), and open market repurchases of long-term debt completed in 2020 and decreased amounts drawn from the Company’s credit facilities ($21 million);
partially offset by:
•
A one-time make-whole interest payment of $19 million resulting from the June 2021 early redemption of the Company’s $600 million, 5.75 percent senior notes due January 30, 2022.
Foreign Exchange (Gain) Loss, Net
Foreign exchange gains and losses primarily result from the impact of fluctuations in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Additional information on changes in foreign exchange gains or losses can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
