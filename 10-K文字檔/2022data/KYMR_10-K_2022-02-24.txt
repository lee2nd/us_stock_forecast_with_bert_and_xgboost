Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics that selectively degrade disease-causing proteins by harnessing the body’s own natural protein degradation system. Our proprietary targeted protein degradation, or TPD, platform, which we refer to as Pegasus™, allows us to discover highly selective small molecule protein degraders with activity against disease-causing proteins throughout the body. We believe that our small molecule protein degraders have unique advantages over existing therapies and allow us to address a large portion of the human genome that was previously intractable with traditional modalities. We focus on biological pathways that have been clinically validated but where key biological nodes/proteins have not been drugged or inadequately drugged. To date, we have utilized our Pegasus™ platform to design novel protein degraders focused in the areas of immunology-inflammation and oncology, and we continue to apply our platform’s capabilities to additional therapeutic areas. We have a mission to drug all target classes in human cells using TPD. Our current clinical stage programs are IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, and STAT3, which each address high impact targets within the interleukin-1 receptor/toll-like receptor, or IL-1R/TLR, and janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, or JAK/STAT, pathways, providing the opportunity to treat a broad range of immune-inflammatory diseases, hematologic malignancies, and solid tumors. Our programs exemplify our focus on addressing high impact targets that have been elusive to conventional modalities and that drive the pathogenesis of multiple serious diseases with significant unmet medical needs. In February 2021, we initiated the single ascending dose, or SAD, portion of our Phase 1 trial of KT-474 in adult healthy volunteers. In July 2021, we initiated the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion of the Phase 1 trial of KT-474 in healthy volunteers. We completed dose escalation in the SAD and MAD portions of this Phase 1 trial in December 2021. A subsequent patient cohort is expected to include hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS, and atopic dermatitis, or AD, patients. With respect to our IRAK4 program, we are collaborating with Sanofi S.A, or Sanofi, on the development of drug candidates targeting IRAK4 outside the oncology and immuno-oncology fields. In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our STAT3 degrader, KT-333, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory liquid and solid tumors, including aggressive lymphomas. We initiated our KT-333 Phase 1 clinical study in January 2022. In November 2021, we also announced that we received FDA clearance of our investigational new drug application, or IND, to evaluate our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, including MYD88 mutant diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). We initiated our KT-413 Phase 1 clinical study in February 2022. Our next program, currently in IND-enabling activities, is a degrader against the E3 ligase MDM2. Our MDM2 degrader has been developed to stabilize the tumor suppressor p53 and address a wide variety of p53 wild type tumor types in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
Since our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, research and development activities, business planning, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have received gross proceeds of $877.1 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock, the sale of common stock including our August 2020 initial public offering, or IPO, and concurrent private placement, and our July 2021 follow-on offering and concurrent private placement, and through our collaborations with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, and Sanofi.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. Our net losses were $100.2 million, $45.6 million and $41.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had an accumulated deficit of $229.0 million and $128.8 million, respectively. We expect that our expense and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•initiate and complete clinical trials for current or future product candidates, including the ongoing Phase 1 trials of KT-474, KT-333 and KT-413;
•prepare and submit Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for KT-253 and future product candidates;
•initiate and continue research and development activities to support our pre-clinical product candidate pipeline;
•continue to develop and expand our PegasusTM platform to identify additional product candidates;
•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•acquire or in-license additional product candidates and technologies;
•expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base and ongoing development activity;
•require the manufacture of larger quantities of our product candidates for clinical development and potential commercialization;
•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; and
•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operating as a public company.
In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our lead product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates. The lengthy process of securing marketing approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product candidate development efforts and our business overall. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $567.6 million. We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2025. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “-Liquidity and capital resources.”
Since it was reported to have surfaced in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2 which leads to COVID-19, has spread across the world and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified and governments around the world, including in the United States, Europe and Asia, have implemented severe travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders and have delayed the commencement of non-COVID-19-related clinical trials, among other restrictions. As a result, the current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as contributing to significant volatility and negative pressure on the U.S. economy and in financial markets. We expect that COVID-19 precautions will directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our planned clinical trials and are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current and future business and operations, including our expenses and clinical trials, as well as on our industry and the healthcare system.
As a result of the pandemic, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. To date, we have instated some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures intended to help ensure our employees’ well-being and minimize business disruption. These measures include devising contingency plans and securing additional resources from third-party service providers. For the safety of our employees and their families, we have temporarily reduced the presence of our scientists in our labs and continue to rely on third parties to conduct many of the experiments and studies
for our research programs. Certain of our third-party service providers have also experienced shutdowns or other business disruptions. We are continuing to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current and future business and operations, including our expenses and planned clinical trial and other development timelines, as well as on our industry and the healthcare system.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. Our only revenues have been derived from research collaboration arrangements with Vertex and Sanofi. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from our current collaboration agreements and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. To date, we have not received any royalties under any of the collaboration agreements.
Vertex Collaboration Agreement
On May 9, 2019, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Vertex Agreement, with Vertex, to advance small molecule protein degradation against up to six targets. Under the Vertex Agreement, Vertex has the exclusive option to license the rights to the product candidates developed through the collaboration at which point Vertex will control development and commercialization. Pursuant to the Vertex Agreement, we are responsible for discovery and preclinical research on the targets, and Vertex is responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the product candidates after it exercises its option to license.
Vertex provided us with a non-refundable upfront payment of $50.0 million and purchased 3,059,695 shares of our Series B-1 convertible preferred stock at $6.54 a share, pursuant to a separate, but simultaneously executed Share Purchase Agreement. We are eligible to receive up to $170.0 million in payments per target, including development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, as well as option exercise payments. In addition, Vertex is obligated to pay us tiered royalties on future net sales on any products that may result from the Vertex Agreement. None of the payments under the Vertex Agreement are refundable. We may also perform follow-on research activities for an optioned target upon Vertex’s request and at Vertex’s expense.
Sanofi Agreement
On July 7, 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Sanofi Agreement, with Sanofi to co-develop drug candidates directed to two biological targets. Under the Sanofi Agreement, we granted to Sanofi a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain lead compounds generated during the collaboration directed against IRAK4 and one additional undisclosed target in an undisclosed field of use. Such license is exercisable on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis only after a specified milestone. For compounds directed against IRAK4, the field of use includes diagnosis, treatment, cure, mitigation or prevention of any diseases, disorders or conditions, excluding oncology and immune-oncology. We are responsible for discovery and preclinical research and conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for at least one degrader directed against IRAK4 plus up to three backup degraders. With respect to both targets, Sanofi is responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of product candidates after a specified development milestone occurs with respect to each collaboration candidate.
We have an exclusive option, or Opt-In Right, exercisable on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis that will include the right to (i) to fund 50% of the United States development costs for collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use and (ii) share equally in the net profits and net losses of commercializing collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use in the United States. In addition, if we exercise the Opt-In Right, Sanofi will grant to us an exclusive option, applicable to each collaboration target, which upon exercise will allow us to conduct certain co-promotion activities in the field in the United States.
The Sanofi Agreement, unless earlier terminated, will expire on a product-by-product basis on the date of expiration of all payment obligations under the Sanofi Agreement with respect to such product. We or Sanofi may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach or insolvency or for certain patent challenges. In addition, Sanofi may terminate the agreement for convenience or for a material safety event upon advance prior written notice, and we may terminate the agreement with respect to any collaboration candidate if, following Sanofi’s assumption of responsibility for the development, commercialization or manufacturing of collaboration candidates with respect to a particular target, Sanofi ceases to exploit any collaboration candidates directed to such target for a specified period.
In consideration for the exclusive licenses granted to Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of $150.0 million. In addition to the upfront payment, we are eligible to receive certain development milestone payments of up to $1.48 billion in the aggregate, of which more than $1.0 billion relates to the IRAK4 program, upon the achievement of certain developmental or regulatory events. We will be eligible to receive certain commercial milestone payments up to $700.0 million in the aggregate, of which $400.0 million relates to the IRAK4 program, which are payable upon the achievement of certain net sales thresholds. We will be eligible to receive tiered royalties for each program on net sales ranging from the high single digits to high teens, subject to low-single digits upward adjustments in certain circumstances.
Operating expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of targeted protein degradation therapeutics, including those in our initial programs, IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, STAT3 and MDM2. These research efforts and costs, which also support the development of, and enhancements to, our PegasusTM platform, include external research costs, personnel costs, supplies, license fees and facility-related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•expenses incurred under agreements with organizations that support our platform program development;
•contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that are primarily engaged to provide drug substance and product for our preclinical research and development programs, nonclinical studies and other scientific development services;
•the cost of acquiring and manufacturing nonclinical trial materials, including manufacturing registration and validation batches;
•facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance;
•costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; and
•payments made under third-party licensing agreements.
Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of any future product candidates.
Our future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•per patient trial costs;
•the number of trials required for approval;
•the number of sites included in the trials;
•the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•the number of doses that patients receive;
•the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates;
•the phase of development of our product candidates; and
•the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.
The successful development and commercialization of product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:
•the timing and progress of nonclinical and clinical development activities;
•the number and scope of nonclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•the ability to raise necessary additional funds;
•the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements;
•our ability to maintain our current development program and to establish new ones;
•our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•the availability of drug substance and drug product for use in production of our product candidates;
•our ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our product candidates are approved;
•our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•our ability to obtain and maintain third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;
•the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•the impact of competition with other products;
•the impact of any business interruptions to our operations, including the timing and enrollment of patients in our planned clinical trials, or to those of our manufacturers, suppliers, or other vendors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crisis; and
•our ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety profile for our therapies following approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate and business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services, insurance costs, administrative travel expenses, marketing expenses and other operating costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support development of our product candidates and our continued research activities. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as legal, investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest and other income and expense, net
Interest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances and interest on our financing leases.
Results of Operations
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Collaboration revenue
We recognize revenue under each of the Vertex Agreement and Sanofi Agreement based on our pattern of performance related to the respective identified performance obligation, which is the period over which we will perform research services under each of the Vertex Agreement and Sanofi Agreement.
Collaboration revenues were $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $18.5 million and $54.3 million were attributable to our collaboration agreements with Vertex and Sanofi, respectively.

We also had a $10.2 million increase in personnel, occupancy and related costs due to increases in employee headcount in the research and development functions.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional service fees and an increase in personnel, facility, occupancy and other expenses stemming from an increase in headcount to support our growth as a public company.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.3 million decrease was primarily due to the prevailing interest rates in the respective periods.
Liquidity and capital resources
We have not yet generated any revenue from any product sales, and we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of products for several years, if at all. To date, we have received gross proceeds of $877.1 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock, the sale of common stock including our August 2020 IPO and concurrent private placement, and our July 2021 follow-on offering and concurrent private placement, and through our collaborations with Vertex and Sanofi. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $567.6 million.
In October 2021, we entered into a sales agreement, or Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $250.0 million from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings through Cowen, as our sales agent. We agreed to pay Cowen a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares sold by Cowen under the Sales Agreement. There have been no shares of our common stock sold under the Sales Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Cash Flows (Used in) provided by Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities used $128.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $100.2 million during the period and a $69.4 million decrease in deferred revenue under our Sanofi and Vertex collaboration agreements. These were offset by adjustments for non-cash items of $33.2 million (primarily consisting of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and premiums and discounts on available sale-securities) and a $7.5 million net increase in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by changes in prepaid expenses and other operating assets and liabilities.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities provided $88.1 million of cash, primarily resulting from $150.0 million of proceeds received under our collaboration agreement with Sanofi executed in July 2020. Cash provided by operating activities also includes an increase of accounts payable and accruals of $6.7 million, an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $0.7 million, offset by our net loss of $45.6 million adjusted for net non-cash items of $8.9 million (primarily stock-based compensation, depreciation expense and amortization of premiums and discounts on securities).
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities provided $17.9 million of cash, resulting from the $55.9 million in aggregate payments received in connection with the Vertex Agreement, including the premium paid on the Series B-1 convertible preferred stock purchase. Cash provided by operating activities also includes an increase of accounts payable and accruals of $3.2 million, an increase of net operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities of $1.0 million offset by a net decrease of operating assets and liabilities of $1.0 million and our net loss of $41.2 million.
Cash Flow used in Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $99.8 million comprised of purchases of marketable securities of $456.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $1.6 million offset by maturities of marketable securities of $358.2 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $422.6 million comprised of purchases of marketable securities of $529.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $9.1 million offset by maturities of marketable securities of $115.9 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, investing activities used $16.5 million of cash, primarily due to $16.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $0.5 million in purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $250.3 million, primarily consisting of $240.8 million of net proceeds received in our July 2021 follow on offering, $2.3 million from our July 2021 concurrent private placement, $7.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $0.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan offset by the payment of $0.4 million in offering costs related to our August 2020 IPO and finance lease payments of $0.8 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $289.3 million, primarily consisting of $183.1 million of net proceeds received in our August 2020 IPO, $13.5 million from our August 2020 concurrent private placement, $88.2 million of proceeds from our issuances of Series C convertible preferred stock in March 2020, net of issuance costs, and $4.8 million of proceeds from the second closing of our Series B convertible preferred stock financing in January 2020, net of issuance costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $34.9 million, which consisted of $14.0 million of proceeds from our issuances of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock in May 2019, net of issuance costs, and $21.2 million of proceeds from the second closing of our Series B convertible preferred stock financing in December 2019, net of issuance costs.
Future funding requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the later-stage clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and programs and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
•the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop;
•our ability to maintain our relationships with Sanofi, Vertex and other key collaborators;
•the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more nonclinical studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect or change their requirements on studies that had previously been agreed to;
•the cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•the effect of competing technological and market developments;
•the costs of continuing to grow our business, including hiring key personnel and maintaining or acquiring operating space;
•the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates, including product pricing, as well as product coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors;
•the cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;
•the cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing;
•the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we determine to commercialize; and
•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.
We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $567.6 million as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2025. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional funding to continue the clinical development of our IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, STAT3 and MDM2 programs, commercialize our product candidates if we receive regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize our product candidates.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
Excluding the 2021 Lease executed in December 2021 for 100,624 square feet of office and lab space in Watertown, Massachusetts, which the Company anticipates occupying in November 2023, during the year ended December 31, 2021, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business.
The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of payment due date for the 2021 Lease at December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
When optional goods or services are offered, we assess the options to determine whether the options grant the customer a material right. This determination includes whether the option is priced at an amount that the customer would not have received without entering into the contract. If we conclude the option conveys a material right, it is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. In identifying performance obligations in a contract, we identify those promises that are distinct. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own, or together with readily available resources, and the goods or services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promise is not distinct, it is combined with other promises in the contract until the combined group of promises is capable of being distinct.
We estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price. For contracts that include sales-based royalties for licensed compounds, we recognize revenue at the date when the related sales occur. Finally, we determine whether the contract contains a significant
financing component by analyzing the promised consideration relative to the standalone selling price of the promised goods and services and the timing of payment relative to the transfer of the promised goods and services. At each reporting date, we reassess the transaction price and probability of achievement of the performance obligations and the associated constraints on transaction price. If necessary, we adjust the transaction price, recording a cumulative catch-up based on progress for the amount that was previously constrained.
Revenue is recognized when (or as) control of a performance obligation is transferred to the customer. When combined performance obligations contain a promised license and related services or other promises, management judgment is required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. In doing so, we must identify the predominant promise or promises in the contract to determine whether revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time. If over time, we must determine the appropriate measure of progress. If a license is deemed to be the predominant promise in a performance obligation, we must determine the nature of the license, whether functional or symbolic intellectual property, to conclude whether point-in-time or over-time revenue recognition is most appropriate. The determination of functional or symbolic intellectual property requires an assessment of whether the customer is able to exploit and benefit from the license in its current condition, or if the utility of the license is dependent on or influenced by our ongoing activities or being associated with us.
At each reporting date, we calculate the measure of progress for the performance obligations transferred over time. The calculation generally uses an input measure based on costs incurred to-date relative to estimated total costs to complete the transfer of the performance obligation. The measurement of progress is then used to calculate the total revenue earned, including any cumulative catch-up adjustment.
Research and Development Contract Costs and Accruals
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with preclinical development activities;
•CROs and investigative sites in connection with our clinical trials and preclinical studies; and
•CMOs in connection with drug substance and drug product formulation of preclinical studies.
We base the expense recorded related to external research and development on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage nonclinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Equity-Based Compensation Expense
We measure equity-based awards granted to employees, directors, and nonemployees based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The equity-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, including common stock subject to vesting. The measurement date for equity awards is the date of grant, and equity-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. We have issued stock options and restricted stock with performance-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards if we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available.
We select companies with comparable characteristics to us with historical share price information that approximates the expected term of the equity-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period that approximates the calculated expected term of our stock options. We will continue to apply this method until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price becomes available. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method, under which the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have no current plans to pay any dividends on common stock.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
As of June 30, 2021, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million, and as a result, as of January 1, 2022, we no longer qualified as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As a large accelerated filer, we are subject to certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that were not applicable to us as an emerging growth company, including compliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, compliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements and full disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Additionally, we are no longer able to take advantage of transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards that are available to emerging growth companies.
