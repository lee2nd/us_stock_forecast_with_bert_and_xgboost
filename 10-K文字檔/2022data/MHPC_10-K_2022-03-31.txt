Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency.
Most states and cities, including where our properties are located, have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, “stay at home” rules and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it.
The rules and restrictions put in place have had a negative impact on the economy and business activity and may adversely impact the ability of our tenants, many of whom may be restricted in their ability to work, to pay their rent as and when due. In addition, our property managers may be limited in their ability to properly maintain our properties. Enforcing our rights as landlord against tenants who fail to pay rent or otherwise do not comply with the terms of their leases may not be possible as many jurisdictions, including those where are properties are located, have established rules and/or regulations preventing us from evicting tenants for certain periods in response to the pandemic. If we are unable to enforce our rights as landlords, our business would be materially affected.
If the current pace of the pandemic does not continue to slow and the spread of the virus is not contained, our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted. We expect that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions, which could require us to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. The duration of any business disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our ability to operate our business and result in additional costs.
The extent to which the pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this report, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and steps taken to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Nevertheless, the pandemic and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors” above.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we earned total revenues of $8,362,277, as compared to $6,380,515 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,981,762, or 31.06%. The increase was primarily due to $1,308,447 of rental income from the acquisition of twenty-four manufactured housing communities during 2021 and a complete year of rental income totaling $241,099 related to two properties acquired during the first quarter of 2020. The remaining increase was due to an average 2% increase in occupancy along with rental rate increases.
Community Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred total community operating expenses of $2,631,270, as compared to $1,633,480 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $997,790, or 61.08%. The increase in community operating expenses was primarily due to additional expenses associated with the twenty-four properties acquired throughout 2021. We incurred additional repairs and maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expenses as expected and we hired additional on-site maintenance staff at several of our new parks to help us to increase efficiencies and decrease contract labor costs as we expanded into new markets this year, including in the Raleigh, Anderson, and Columbia metropolitan areas, among others. Community operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 31.47% and 25.60% during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Corporate Payroll and Overhead Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred corporate payroll and overhead expenses of $3,013,810, as compared to $1,581,807 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,432,003, or 90.53%. This increase was primarily due to increased payroll including corporate salaries and benefits expense of $481,180 due to hiring additional personnel to support our growth and an increase in employee bonuses of $306,870. Additionally, we incurred increased audit and legal fees of approximately $45,000 largely driven by the volume of 2021 acquisitions, increased rent expense for our corporate office space by $96,000, and approximately $200,000 of additional marketing and travel expenses. Corporate payroll and overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue were 36.04% and 24.79% during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded depreciation expense and amortization of acquisition costs of $2,060,882, as compared to $1,652,509 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $408,373, or 24.71%. The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by approximately $260,000 related to the acquisition of depreciable assets in twenty-four manufactured housing communities during 2021 and an increase of $88,628 from a complete year of depreciation expense related to the two properties acquired during 2020. The remaining increase was due to capital improvement projects completed during the year ended December 31, 2021, such as home renovations and new home installations.
Interest Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred interest expense of $2,243,876, as compared to $1,961,843 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $282,033, or 14.38%. The increase was primarily related to the increase in interest expense of $296,274 on additional debt incurred to acquire new properties in 2021 and an increase of $76,252 from dividends to preferred stockholders, which are included in interest expense given the liability treatment of the mandatorily redeemable Series C Preferred Stock, offset by decreases due to the payoff of our Butternut mortgage in 2020 upon selling the community. Interest expense as a percentage of revenues was 26.83% and 30.75% during 2021 and 2020, respectively, which continues to improve as we refinance and pay down our existing debt and obtain new loans for acquisitions with more favorable terms.
Refinancing Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $110,691 of refinancing costs, as compared to $464,568 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $353,877, or 76.17%. The 2021 expense related to the refinancing of three loans connected to our Springlake communities for a new loan with one lender. Upon the refinance, we wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs connected with the original debt. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we refinanced notes payable related to five of our communities.
Other Income. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized other income of $139,300 upon forgiveness of our Paycheck Protection Program loan by the Small Business Administration in June 2021, compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gain on Sale of Property. We did not sell any of our communities during the year ended December 31, 2021. We recognized a gain on the sale of our Butternut community equal to $761,978 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Loss. The factors described above resulted in a net loss of $1,558,952 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $151,714 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,407,238, or 927.56%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,106,329, including restricted cash of $705,195. In addition to cash generated through operations, we use a variety of sources to fund our cash needs, including acquisitions and sales of properties. We intend to continue to increase our real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield more than our cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. Our ability to continue acquiring communities are dependent on our ability to raise capital. There is no guarantee that any of these additional opportunities will materialize or that we will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet our investment criteria and appropriate financing.
We will require additional funding to finance the growth of our current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives. We believe that our current available cash along with anticipated revenues is sufficient to meet our cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to us, if at all.
We plan to meet our short-term liquidity requirements for the next twelve months, generally through available cash as well as net cash provided by operating activities and with funds available to us under the existing $1.5 million revolving note described below.

Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition. Mobile home rental and related income is generated from lease agreements for our sites and homes. The lease component of these agreements is accounted for under Topic 842 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, for leases.
Under ASC 842, we must assess on an individual lease basis whether it is probable that we will collect the future lease payments. We consider the tenant’s payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable, we write-off the tenant’s receivables, including straight-line rent receivable, and limit lease income to cash received.
Our revenues primarily consist of rental revenues and tenant fee income. We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
● Rental revenues include revenues from the leasing land lot or a combination of both, the mobile home and land at our properties to tenants.
○ Revenues from the leasing of land lot or a combination of both, the mobile home and land at our properties to tenants include (i) lease components, including land lot or a combination of both, the mobile home and land, and (ii) reimbursement of utilities and account for the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC 842.
○ Revenues derived from fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable period of the lease. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. Revenue derived from the reimbursement of utilities are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. Our leases are month-to-month.
Acquisitions. We account for acquisitions as asset acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” and allocate the purchase price of the property based upon the fair value of the assets acquired, which generally consist of land, site and land improvements, buildings and improvements and rental homes. We allocate the purchase price of an acquired property generally determined by internal evaluation as well as third-party appraisal of the property obtained in conjunction with the purchase.
Variable Interest Entities. In December 2020, we entered into a property management agreement with Gvest Finance LLC, a company owned and controlled by our parent company, Gvest Real Estate Capital LLC, an entity whose sole owner is Raymond M. Gee, our chairman and chief executive officer, and have subsequently entered into property management agreements with Gvest Homes I LLC, Gvest Anderson Homes LLC, Gvest Capital View Homes LLC, Gvest Hidden Oaks Homes LLC, Gvest Springlake Homes LLC, Gvest Carolinas 4 Homes LLC, Gvest Sunnyland Homes LLC and Gvest Warrenville Homes LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Gvest Finance LLC. Under the property management agreements, we manage the homes owned by the VIEs and the VIEs remit to our company all income, less any sums paid out for debt service plus 5% of the debt service payment.
Additionally, during 2021, we formed two entities, Brainerd Place LLC and Bull Creek LLC, for the purpose of exploring opportunities to develop mobile home communities. We own 49% of these entities and Gvest Real Estate LLC, an entity whose sole owner is Raymond M. Gee, our chairman and chief executive officer, owns 51%. We also executed operating agreements with these entities which designate Gvest Capital Management LLC, a company owned and controlled by Gvest Real Estate Capital LLC, as manager with the authority, power, and discretion to manage and control the entities’ business decisions. The operating agreements require us to make cash contributions to the entities to fund their activities, operations, and existence, if we approve the contribution requests from the manager, which ultimately provides us with power to direct the economically significant activities of these entities.
A company with interests in a VIE must consolidate the entity if the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE; that is, if it has both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships that may be difficult to understand and to make a significant judgment, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date. Primarily due to our common ownership by Mr. Gee, our power to direct the activities of these entities that most significantly impact their economic performance, and the fact that we have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from these entities that could potentially be significant to these entities, the entities listed above are considered to be VIEs in accordance applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
Investment Property and Depreciation. Investment property, including property and equipment, is carried at cost. Depreciation for Sites and Building is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (ranging from 15 to 25 years). Depreciation of Improvements to Sites and Buildings, Rental Homes and Equipment and Vehicles is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (ranging from 3 to 25 years). Land Development Costs are not depreciated until they are put in use, at which time they are capitalized as Sites and Land Improvements. Interest Expense pertaining to Land Development Costs are capitalized. Maintenance and Repairs are charged to expense as incurred and improvements are capitalized. The costs and related accumulated depreciation of property sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the financial statement and any gain or loss is reflected in the current period’s results of operations.
Impairment Policy. We apply FASB ASC 360-10, “Property, Plant & Equipment,” to measure impairment in real estate investments. Rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis without interest) from a rental property is less than the carrying value under its historical net cost basis. These expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. Upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, rental properties are reduced to their fair value. For properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and/or it is actively being marketed for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less its cost to sell. After the date we determine a property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded. There was no impairment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
