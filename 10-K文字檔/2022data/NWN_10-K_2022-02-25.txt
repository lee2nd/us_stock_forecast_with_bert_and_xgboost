ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is management’s assessment of NW Holdings' and NW Natural's financial condition, including the principal factors that affect results of operations. The discussion covers the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and refers to the consolidated results of NW Holdings, the substantial majority of which consist of the operating results of NW Natural. When significant activity exists at NW Holdings that does not exist at NW Natural, additional disclosure has been provided. References in this discussion to "Notes" are to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
NW Natural's natural gas distribution activities are reported in the natural gas distribution (NGD) segment. The NGD segment also includes NWN Gas Reserves, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Corp, the NGD-portion of NW Natural's Mist storage facility in Oregon, and NW Natural RNG Holding Company, LLC. Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Natural include the non-NGD storage activity at Mist as well as asset management services and the appliance retail center operations. Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Holdings include NNG Financial's investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline); NW Natural Renewables Holdings, LLC and its non-regulated renewable natural gas activities; and NWN Water, which through itself or its subsidiaries, owns and continues to pursue investments in the water sector. See Note 4 for further discussion of our business segment and other, as well as our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
In addition, NW Holdings has reported discontinued operations results related to the sale of Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch). NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement during the second quarter of 2018 that provided for the sale of all membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility. The sale was completed on December 4, 2020. For more information, see "Results of Operations - Discontinued Operations" below.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. In addition to presenting the results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain financial measures are expressed in cents per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. All references in this section to earnings per share (EPS) are on the basis of diluted shares. Such non-GAAP financial measures are used to analyze our financial performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than how such measures are calculated in this report, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below.

Key financial highlights for NW Holdings include:
Key financial highlights for NW Natural include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Consolidated net income increased $10.6 million at NW Natural primarily due to the following factors:
•$41.7 million increase in NGD segment margin driven by the 2020 Oregon rate case and residential customer growth;
•$7.9 million increase in asset management revenue primarily due to the 2021 cold weather event discussed below; and
•$2.4 million decrease in other income (expense), net driven by higher interest income on regulatory assets and lower pension non-service costs; partially offset by
•$19.9 million increase in operations and maintenance expenses due to higher information technology expenses, compensation and benefit costs, and lease expense;
•$8.9 million increase in depreciation expense due to property, plant, and equipment additions as we continued to invest in our gas utility system;
•$7.2 million increase in income tax expense due to an increase in pretax income and Oregon Corporate Activity Tax;
•$3.7 million increase in general taxes primarily due to higher assessed property values; and
•$2.1 million increase in interest expense primarily due to lower AFUDC interest income.
Net income from continuing operations increased $8.4 million at NW Holdings primarily due to the following factors:
•$10.6 million increase in consolidated net income at NW Natural as discussed above; partially offset by
•$2.2 million decrease in other net income primarily reflecting higher business development and consulting costs at the holding company.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Consolidated net income increased $1.6 million at NW Natural primarily due to the following factors:
•$15.4 million increase in NGD segment margin driven by the 2020 Oregon and 2019 Washington rate cases and residential customer growth; and
•$7.9 million decrease in other expense, net primarily related to higher 2019 pension expenses (non-service cost component) recognized as part of the settlement and recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which was primarily offset within NGD margin and income tax benefits (as discussed below) and which did not recur in 2020; partially offset by
•$13.6 million increase in depreciation expense and general taxes due to property, plant, and equipment additions, as we continued to invest in our gas utility system; and
•$7.0 million increase in income tax expense primarily due to 2019 including an income tax benefit related to the return of deferred Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) benefits to customers and the regulatory pension disallowance, and higher pre-tax income.
Net income from continuing operations increased $5.0 million at NW Holdings primarily due to the following factors:
•$1.6 million increase in consolidated net income at NW Natural as discussed above; and
•$3.4 million increase in other net income primarily reflecting higher earnings at our water and wastewater utilities that have been acquired since 2019.
2021 COLD WEATHER EVENT. In February 2021, Portland, Oregon and the surrounding region, like much of the country, experienced a severe winter storm with several days of colder temperatures resulting in elevated natural gas demand and significantly higher spot prices. Additional market gas purchases and other expenses resulted in approximately $29 million of higher commodity costs, of which approximately $27 million was deferred to a regulatory asset for recovery in future rates. The result was approximately $2 million of lower natural gas utility margin in the first quarter of 2021. The higher commodity costs were offset by approximately $39 million of asset management revenue, of which approximately $33 million was deferred to a regulatory liability for the benefit of customers.
COVID-19 AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has resulted in severe and widespread global, national, and local economic and societal disruptions. As a critical infrastructure energy company that provides an essential service to our customers, NW Natural has well-defined emergency response command structures and protocols. In response to the pandemic, NW Natural initially mobilized its incident command team and business continuity plans in early March 2020, with a focus on the safety of our 1,200 employees and the 2.5 million people, business partners and communities we serve. For employees whose role requires them to work in the field or onsite, we are following CDC, OSHA, and state specific requirements. Our water companies are following similar protocols. In addition, we have enhanced cybersecurity monitoring in response to reports that cybersecurity attackers are more active with the economy utilizing work from home protocols.
The states we operate in have reopened with many businesses beginning to return to normal operating practices; however, the timing for recovery of businesses and local economies remains difficult to predict and dependent on the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resurgences or mutations of the virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, any potential future shutdowns, efficacy and acceptance of vaccines, or any governmental or other requirements related to vaccines or testing. We currently have the following expectations and beliefs:
•Both NW Natural and NW Natural Water expect their capital projects in 2022 to move forward as planned.
•We have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain for goods and services to date. Our suppliers may be subject to vaccine mandates and could be impacted by an inability to comply or loss of personnel, which could disrupt supplier performance or deliveries, and negatively impact our business. We are continuing to actively monitor, and have formulated and continue to evaluate contingency plans as necessary.
•NW Natural's customer growth rate is affected by both new meter connections and when existing customers close their accounts and disconnect their meters. Customer growth from construction and conversions remained strong during 2021 and commercial customer counts remained steady. Any slowdown in economic activity could result in a decline in new meter connections, which could adversely affect operating margins in 2022 and the following periods. We have resumed normal collection practices for all customers. There are several bill assistance options available to residential customers, including the arrearage management program, that was specifically designed to help with bills incurred during the pandemic. We have not experienced and do not currently anticipate significant residential meter disconnections.
•NW Natural has seen lower utility margin from a reduction in overall sales volumes during 2021 and 2020 attributed to COVID-19. Due to the seasonality of our gas utility business, we may continue to experience declines in volumes, particularly during our winter heating season, depending on the resiliency of businesses in the communities in which we serve into 2022. However, volumes do not translate directly to earnings as the majority of our NGD margin is not dependent on volumes.
•While we deferred to a regulatory asset certain COVID-related financial impacts as agreed upon with regulators, ultimate recovery of these costs and prudence review will be determined through separate proceedings and may be subject to modification as a result of those proceedings. The recognition of late fee revenue may also be delayed beyond our current expectations. See “Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters - COVID-19 Process and Deferral Dockets” below.
Given the evolving nature of the pandemic and resulting economic conditions, we are continually monitoring our business operations and the larger trends and developments to take additional measures we believe are warranted to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities while protecting our employees.
2022 OUTLOOK
We expect to make significant progress on our long-term objectives in the coming year. Our natural gas distribution business is focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible way to better the lives of the public we serve. Our water and wastewater utility business is committed to providing its customers with safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services, while also continuing to grow organically and through acquisitions. Our new subsidiary, NW Natural Renewables, is focused on providing renewable natural gas to a variety of sectors. In 2022, we remain focused on the strategic pillars of our business: safe & reliable service; superior customer service; constructive legislative policies and regulation; growth; and driving toward decarbonization.
ENSURING SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE. Delivering our products safely and reliably to customers, while keeping our employees safe, is our first priority. At NW Natural, we remain focused on safety and emergency response through hands-on, scenario-based training for employees, third-party contractors, and first responders. The reliability, resiliency and safety of our gas system is critical and to this end, we remain focused on investing in necessary upgrades and replacing key system components, preventing third-party damages, and performing regular inspections and assessments. Safety for our gas infrastructure also includes maintaining and strengthening our cybersecurity defenses, upgrading key technology systems, such as our enterprise risk planning system and customer information system over the next several years, and preparing for large-scale emergency events, such as seismic hazards. Our water and wastewater utilities are focused on executing on their capital expenditure plans to ensure continued safe and reliable service to customers and enhancing plans to be able to readily prioritize capital investments.
PROVIDING SUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. We have a legacy of providing excellent customer service and a long-standing dedication to continuous improvement, which has resulted in NW Natural consistently receiving high rankings in the J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction studies. Additionally, NW Natural earned the designation of Customer Champion in Escalent's Congent trusted brand and customer engagement residential customer study for the last several years.
ADVANCING CONSTRUCTIVE LEGISLATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATION. NW Natural has a history of working productively with lawmakers and regulators. For example in 2020, rulemaking was completed on the groundbreaking Oregon Senate Bill 98 that allows gas utilities to procure and invest in renewable natural gas for their customers. In 2022, we intend to continue to proactively communicate with policymakers and other stakeholders about what we believe is the important role of the gas system in achieving climate goals for our communities. With regulators, we continue to strive to work productively on open proceedings. For our water utilities, we are focused on working collaboratively with regulators, pursuing efficient approval processes for acquisitions, filing general rate cases where needed to support investments, and engaging in constructive regulatory proceedings.
ENABLING GROWTH. Homeowners in our service territory prefer natural gas for heating and cooking given its affordable, efficient, and reliable qualities. We are focused on leveraging these key attributes to capitalize on our region's continued strong housing growth. We'll strive to continue growing our market share in the residential and commercial sectors and multifamily developments. At NW Natural Water, we continue to be focused on supporting the fast-growing communities we currently serve and continuing our disciplined acquisition strategy. Finally, we know how important renewables, particularly renewable natural gas, are to addressing climate change. That is why we began a new business line in 2021 that is committed to leading as the energy market transitions and providing renewable natural gas to the utility, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors. In 2022, we intend to continue to pursue these renewable opportunities.
LEADING ON DECARBONIZATION. We are deeply committed to a clean energy future and environmental stewardship. NW Natural has been a leader among gas utilities in innovative programs designed to support a low carbon future. Notable programs have included a decoupling rate structure designed to weaken the link between earnings and gas consumption by customers adopted in 2007, establishment of a voluntary Smart Energy carbon offset program for customers established in 2007, and removal of all known cast iron and bare steel to create one of the tightest and most modern distribution systems in the country. NW Natural launched a low-carbon initiative in 2017 to reduce emissions in the communities we serve by leveraging our modern natural gas pipeline system in new ways, working closely with customers, policymakers and regulators, and embracing new technology. In 2020 and 2021, under Oregon Senate Bill 98, NW Natural began investing in and contracting for RNG-energy produced from capturing methane from decomposing organic material, including food, agricultural and forest waste, waste water and landfills, conditioning the methane to pipeline quality and adding it to natural gas systems as an energy source. RNG has powerful potential to reduce net GHG emissions and we have begun procuring it and its attributes on behalf of customers. To date, NW Natural has signed agreements with options to purchase or develop RNG for utility customers totaling about 3% of NW Natural's annual sales volume in Oregon. In 2022, NW Natural intends to continue striving to: execute on our renewable strategy by helping our customers reduce and offset their consumption, procure and invest in RNG for our customers under Oregon Senate Bill 98, execute on our RNG interconnection projects, continue developing voluntary renewable product offerings for our customers, and explore renewable hydrogen. We also intend to leverage technology and relationships to examine ways to reduce emissions across the entire value chain from suppliers to end-use heating appliances.
DIVIDENDS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Regulatory Matters
Regulation and Rates
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION. NW Natural's natural gas distribution business is subject to regulation by the OPUC and WUTC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service, systems of accounts, and issuances of securities by NW Natural. In 2021, approximately 88% of NGD customers were located in Oregon, with the remaining 12% in Washington. Earnings and cash flows from natural gas distribution operations are largely determined by rates set in general rate cases and other proceedings in Oregon and Washington. They are also affected by weather, the local economies in Oregon and Washington, the pace of customer growth in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets, customer preferences and NW Natural's ability to remain price competitive, control expenses, and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery of its natural gas distribution-related costs, including operating expenses and investment costs in plant and other regulatory assets. See "Most Recent Completed Rate Cases" below.
MIST INTERSTATE GAS STORAGE. NW Natural's interstate storage activity at Mist is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC also regulates the intrastate storage services at Mist, while FERC regulates the interstate storage services at Mist. The FERC uses a maximum cost of service model which allows for gas storage prices to be set at or below the cost of service as approved by each agency in their last regulatory filing. The OPUC Schedule 80 rates are tied to the FERC rates, and are updated whenever NW Natural modifies FERC maximum rates.
OTHER. The wholly-owned regulated water businesses of NWN Water, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, are subject to regulation by the utility commissions in the states in which they are located, which currently includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Texas.
Most Recent Completed Rate Cases
OREGON. On October 16, 2020, the OPUC issued an order concluding NW Natural's general rate case filed in December 2019 (OPUC Order). The OPUC Order provides for a total revenue requirement increase of approximately $45 million over revenues from existing rates. The revenue requirement is based on the following assumptions:
•Capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt;
•Return on equity of 9.4%;
•Cost of capital of 6.965%; and
•Average rate base of $1.44 billion or an increase of $242.1 million since the last rate case.
Under the terms of the OPUC Order, NW Natural was authorized to begin to recover the expense associated with the Oregon Corporate Activity Tax (CAT) as a component of base rates. See "Corporate Activity Tax" below.
In NW Natural's previous Oregon rate case in March 2019, the OPUC ordered specific terms by which excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) associated with the TCJA would be provided to customers directly or applied for the benefit of customers. The Order in the most recent Oregon rate case directs NW Natural to include a true-up credit to customers of approximately $1.0 million as a temporary rate adjustment to be amortized over the 2020-21 PGA year.
In addition, the OPUC Order approved the application of NW Natural’s decoupling calculation for the months of November and May to the month of April. The decoupling mechanism is intended to encourage customers to conserve energy without adversely affecting earnings due to reductions in sales volumes.
New rates authorized by the OPUC Order were effective November 1, 2020.
From November 1, 2018 through October 31, 2020, the OPUC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.4%, an overall rate of return of 7.317%, and a capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt.
WASHINGTON. On October 21, 2021, the WUTC issued an order concluding NW Natural's general rate case filed in December 2020 (WUTC Order). The WUTC Order provides for an annual revenue requirement increase over two years, consisting of a 6.4% or $5.0 million increase in the first year beginning November 1, 2021 (Year One), and up to a 3.5% or $3.0 million increase in the second year beginning November 1, 2022 (Year Two). The increase is based on the following assumptions:
•Cost of capital of 6.814%; and
•Average rate base of $194.7 million, an increase of $20.9 million since the last rate case for capital expenditures already expended at the time of filing, with an additional expected $31.2 million increase in Year One, and an additional expected $21.4 million increase in Year Two, with the increases in Year One and Year Two relating to expected capital expenditures in those years.
The WUTC Order does not specify the underlying inputs to the cost of capital, including capital structure and return on equity. New rates authorized by the WUTC Order were effective November 1, 2021.
From November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021, the WUTC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.4% and an overall rate of return of 7.161% with a capital structure of 50.0% long-term debt, 1.0% short-term debt, and 49.0% common equity. The WUTC also authorized the recovery of environmental remediation expenses allocable to Washington customers through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and directed NW Natural to provide federal tax reform benefits to customers. See "Rate Mechanisms - Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery - Washington ECRM" below.
FERC. NW Natural is required under its Mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for its interstate storage services. On October 12, 2018, NW Natural filed a rate petition with FERC for revised cost-based maximum rates, which incorporated the new federal corporate income tax rate. The revised rates were effective beginning November 1, 2018.
NW Natural continuously evaluates the need for rate cases in its jurisdictions.
Regulatory Proceeding Updates
2022 OREGON RATE CASE. On December 17, 2021, NW Natural filed a request for a general rate increase with the OPUC. The filing includes a requested $73.5 million annual revenue requirement increase based upon the following assumptions or requests:
•Capital structure of 50% long-term debt and 50% equity;
•Return on equity of 9.5%;
•Cost of capital of 6.886%; and
•Average rate base of $1.73 billion.
The filing includes an increase in average rate base of $294 million compared to the last rate case due to several long-planned investments by NW Natural including the following:
•Upgrading technology including our enterprise resource planning system, cybersecurity and other critical technology systems;
•Supporting distribution system reinforcement and expansion as well as enhancing the resilience of our operating facilities and systems; and
•Investing in components of our Mist storage facility, which provides service during peak winter heating months.
The filing requests an additional incremental revenue amount of $8.4 million primarily related to a renewable natural gas investment and technology upgrades and expenses, including cybersecurity items, that are not considered in NW Natural's annual revenue requirement.
NW Natural’s filing will be reviewed by the OPUC and other stakeholders. The process is anticipated to take up to 10 months with new rates expected to take effect November 1, 2022.
Rate Mechanisms
During 2021 and 2020, NW Natural's key approved rates and recovery mechanisms for each service area included:
Annually, or more often if circumstances warrant, NW Natural reviews all regulatory assets for recoverability. If NW Natural should determine all or a portion of these regulatory assets no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, then NW Natural would be required to write-off the net unrecoverable balances against earnings in the period such a determination was made.
PURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT. Rate changes are established for NW Natural each year under PGA mechanisms in Oregon and Washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases. The PGA filings include gas costs under spot purchases as well as contract supplies, gas cost hedges, gas costs from the withdrawal of storage inventories, the production of gas reserves, interstate pipeline demand costs, temporary rate adjustments, which amortize balances of deferred regulatory accounts, and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year.
Each year, NW Natural hedges gas prices on a portion of NW Natural's annual sales requirement based on normal weather, including both physical and financial hedges. NW Natural entered the 2021-22 gas year with its forecasted sales volumes hedged at approximately 79% in total. The total hedged for Oregon was approximately 82%, including 62% in financial hedges and 19% in physical gas supplies. The total hedged for Washington was approximately 57%, including 44% in financial hedges and 13% in physical gas supplies.
NW Natural is also hedged between 2% and 29% for annual requirements over the subsequent five gas years, which consists of between 2% and 26% in Oregon and between 0% and 50% in Washington. Hedge levels are subject to change based on actual load volumes, which depend to a certain extent on weather, economic conditions, and estimated gas reserve production. Also, gas storage inventory levels may increase or decrease with storage expansion, changes in storage contracts with third parties, variations in the heat content of the gas, and/or storage recall by NW Natural.
In September 2021, NW Natural filed its annual PGA and received OPUC and WUTC approval in October 2021. PGA rate changes were effective November 1, 2021. Rates may vary between states due to different rate structures, rate mechanisms and hedging policies.
Under the current PGA mechanism in Oregon, there is an incentive sharing provision whereby NW Natural is required to select each year an 80% deferral or a 90% deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated PGA prices, such that the impact on NW Natural's current earnings from the incentive sharing is either 20% or 10% of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs, respectively. For the 2020-21 and 2021-22 gas years, NW Natural selected the 90% deferral option. Under the Washington PGA mechanism, NW Natural defers 100% of the higher or lower actual gas costs, and those gas cost differences are passed on to customers through the annual PGA rate adjustment.
During 2021, there was increased volatility and pricing in the current and forward gas markets. In response to higher than normal volatility in forward gas markets in 2021, NW Natural increased its hedging level for the 2021-22 PGA year in Oregon to 82% compared to 74% in the 2020-2021 PGA year.
EARNINGS TEST REVIEW. NW Natural is subject to an annual earnings review in Oregon to determine if the NGD business is earning above its authorized ROE threshold. If NGD business earnings exceed a specific ROE level, then 33% of the amount above that level is required to be deferred or refunded to customers. Under this provision, if NW Natural selects the 80% deferral gas cost option, then NW Natural retains all earnings up to 150 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. If NW Natural selects the 90% deferral option, then it retains all earnings up to 100 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. For the 2020-21 and 2021-22 gas years, NW Natural selected the 90% deferral option. The ROE threshold is subject to adjustment annually based on movements in long-term interest rates. For calendar years 2019, 2020, and 2021, the ROE threshold was 10.24%, 10.40%, and 10.40%, respectively. There were no refunds required for 2019 and 2020. NW Natural does not expect a refund for 2021 based on results, and anticipates filing its 2021 earnings test in May 2022.
GAS RESERVES. In 2011, the OPUC approved the Encana gas reserves transaction to provide long-term gas price protection for NGD business customers and determined costs under the agreement would be recovered on an ongoing basis through the annual PGA mechanism. Gas produced from NW Natural's interests is sold at then prevailing market prices, and revenues from such sales, net of associated operating and production costs and amortization, are included in cost of gas. The cost of gas, including a carrying cost for the rate base investment made under the original agreement, is included in NW Natural's annual Oregon PGA filing, which allows NW Natural to recover these costs through customer rates. The net investment under the original agreement earns a rate of return.
In 2014, NW Natural amended the original gas reserves agreement in response to Encana's sale of its interest in the Jonah field located in Wyoming to Jonah Energy. Under the amended agreement with Jonah Energy, NW Natural has the option to invest in additional wells on a well-by-well basis with drilling costs and resulting gas volumes shared at the amended proportionate working interest for each well in which NW Natural invests. Volumes produced from the additional wells drilled after the amended agreement are included in NW Natural's Oregon PGA at a fixed rate of $0.4725 per therm. NW Natural has not participated in additional wells since 2014.
DECOUPLING. In Oregon, NW Natural has a decoupling mechanism. Decoupling is intended to break the link between earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers, removing any financial incentive to discourage customers’ efforts to conserve energy. The Oregon decoupling baseline usage per customer was reset in the 2020 Oregon general rate case. The Order in the 2020 Oregon general rate case also approved of extending NW Natural’s decoupling calculation for the months of November and May to the month of April. This mechanism employs a use-per-customer decoupling calculation, which adjusts margin revenues to account for the difference between actual and expected customer volumes. The margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account, which is included in the annual PGA filing.
WARM. In Oregon, NW Natural has an approved weather normalization mechanism (WARM), which is applied to residential and small commercial customer bills. This mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and small commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather, with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average. The mechanism is applied to bills from December through mid-May of each heating season. The mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers’ rates to reflect average weather, which uses the 25-year average temperature for each day of the billing period. Daily average temperatures and 25-year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit for residential customers and 58 degrees Fahrenheit for commercial customers. The collections of any unbilled WARM amounts due to tariff caps and floors are deferred and earn a carrying charge until collected, or returned, in the PGA the following year. Residential and small commercial customers in Oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism, and as of December 31, 2021, 8% of total eligible customers had opted out. NW Natural does not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for Washington customers, which account for about 12% of total customers. See "Business Segment-Natural Gas Distribution" below.
INDUSTRIAL TARIFFS. The OPUC and WUTC have approved tariffs covering NGD service to major industrial customers, which are intended to give NW Natural certainty in the level of gas supplies needed to serve this customer group. The approved terms include, among other things, an annual election period, special pricing provisions for out-of-cycle changes, and a requirement that industrial customers complete the term of their service election under NW Natural's annual PGA tariff.
ENVIRONMENTAL COST DEFERRAL AND RECOVERY. NW Natural has authorizations in Oregon and Washington to defer costs related to remediation of properties that are owned or were previously owned by NW Natural. In Oregon, a Site Remediation and Recovery Mechanism (SRRM) is currently in place to recover prudently incurred costs allocable to Oregon customers, subject to an earnings test. Effective beginning November 1, 2019, the WUTC authorized an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) for recovery of prudently incurred costs allocable to Washington customers.
Oregon SRRM
Under the Oregon SRRM collection process, there are three types of deferred environmental remediation expense:
•Pre-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has not yet been deemed prudent by the OPUC. Carrying costs on these remediation expenses are recorded at NW Natural's authorized cost of capital. NW Natural anticipates the prudence review for annual costs and approval of the earnings test prescribed by the OPUC to occur by the third quarter of the following year.
•Post-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has been deemed prudent and allowed after applying the earnings test, but is not yet included in amortization. NW Natural earns a carrying cost on these amounts at a rate equal to the five-year treasury rate plus 100 basis points.
•Amortization - This class of costs represents amounts included in current customer rates for collection and is calculated as one-fifth of the post-review deferred balance. NW Natural earns a carrying cost equal to the amortization rate determined annually by the OPUC, which approximates a short-term borrowing rate. NW Natural included $6.3 million and $4.2 million of deferred remediation expense approved by the OPUC for collection during the 2021-22 and 2020-21 PGA years, respectively.
In addition, the SRRM also provides for the annual collection of $5.0 million from Oregon customers through a tariff rider. As it collects amounts from customers, NW Natural recognizes these collections as revenue net of any earnings test adjustments and separately amortizes an equal and offsetting amount of the deferred regulatory asset balance through the environmental remediation operating expense line shown separately in the operating expenses section of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note 17 for more information on our environmental matters.
The SRRM earnings test is an annual review of adjusted NGD ROE compared to authorized NGD ROE. To apply the earnings test NW Natural must first determine what if any costs are subject to the test through the following calculation:
(1) Prior year carry-over results when the prior year amount transferred to post-review is negative. The negative amount is carried over to offset annual spend in the following year.
(2) Deferred interest is added to annual spend to the extent the spend is recoverable.
To the extent the NGD business earns at or below its authorized ROE as defined in the SRRM, the total amount transferred to post-review is recoverable through the SRRM. To the extent more than authorized ROE is earned in a year, the amount transferred to post-review would be reduced by those earnings that exceed its authorized ROE.
For 2021, NW Natural has performed this test, which is anticipated to be submitted to the OPUC in May 2022. No earnings test adjustment is expected for 2021.
Washington ECRM
The ECRM established by the WUTC order effective November 1, 2019 permits NW Natural’s recovery of environmental remediation expenses allocable to Washington customers. These expenses represent 3.32% of costs associated with remediation of sites that historically served both Oregon and Washington customers. The order allows for recovery of past deferred and future prudently incurred remediation costs allocable to Washington through application of insurance proceeds and collections from customers. Prudently incurred costs that were deferred from the initial deferral authorization in February 2011 through June 2019 are to be fully offset with insurance proceeds, with any remaining insurance proceeds to be amortized over a 10.5 year period. On an annual basis, NW Natural will file for a prudence determination and a request to recover remediation expenditures in excess of insurance amortizations in the following year's customer rates. After insurance proceeds are fully amortized, if in a particular year the request to collect deferred amounts exceeds one percent of Washington normalized revenues, then the excess will be collected over three years with interest.
INTERSTATE STORAGE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SHARING. On an annual basis, NW Natural credits amounts to Oregon and Washington customers as part of a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism related to net revenues earned from Mist gas storage and asset management activities. Previously, amounts were credited to Oregon customers in June. Starting in 2021, Oregon customers received this credit in February per the 2020 Oregon rate case order. In December 2021, the OPUC approved the annual 2022 bill credit for Oregon customer’s share of interstate storage and asset management activities. The amount will be credited to Oregon customers over three equal installments in January, February and March 2022. This includes $41.4 million of revenues generated for the November 2020 through October 2021 PGA year. A majority of this revenue is from the cold weather event in February 2021 discussed above. Credits are given to customers in Washington as reductions in rates through the annual PGA filing in November.
The following table presents the credits to NGD customers:
COVID-19 PROCESS AND DEFERRAL DOCKETS. During 2020, our regulated utilities, other utilities, stakeholders, and public utility commissions worked together to determine the best way to continue protecting utility customers during and after the pandemic. In September 2020, the OPUC issued an order authorizing OPUC staff to execute a term sheet with NW Natural and other parties to the proceeding, which includes provisions for lifting moratoriums on disconnections for nonpayment and late fees; extending timeframes for repayments and deferred payment plans; establishing timelines for reinstitution of service disconnection and reconnection fees; and allowing for deferred accounting of COVID-19 related costs. The term sheet also directed NW Natural to work with the parties to provide bill payment assistance, petition the Oregon legislature for bill payment assistance funding, explore the applicability of decoupling charges for a period of time, and participate in an investigation and discussion surrounding low income customers and social and environmental justice. The stipulation incorporating the term sheet was approved by the OPUC in November 2020. A term sheet was approved by the WUTC in October 2020 that provided similar guidance on key items such as the timing of lifting moratoriums on disconnections, resuming the collection process, and bill assistance and payment plans.
Additionally, both Oregon and Washington approved our applications in 2020 to defer certain COVID-19 related costs.
Costs that may be recoverable include, but are not limited to, the following: personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies and services, bad debt expense, financing costs to secure liquidity, and certain lost revenue, net of offsetting direct expense reductions associated with COVID-19. As of December 31, 2021, we believe that approximately $11.2 million of the financial effects related to COVID-19 are recoverable and deferred to a regulatory asset approximately $8.6 million for incurred costs. In addition, we expect to recognize revenue in a future period for an additional $2.6 million related to forgone late fee revenue.
The following table outlines some of the key items approved by the respective Commissions:
* Jurisdiction retains discretion to re-evaluate date based on ongoing pandemic and economic conditions.
ARREARAGE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. As part of the approved term sheets, NW Natural established programs in Oregon and Washington to identify and mitigate residential customer arrearages associated with COVID-19. Under the Oregon program, NW Natural can provide a one-time grant of up to $1,200 per eligible residential customer. Under the Washington program, income-eligible customers may receive up to $2,500 per year. Funding for these arrearage management programs may not exceed 1% of retail revenues. These programs are funded by NW Natural with recovery facilitated through the COVID-19 deferral dockets. As of December 31, 2021, the amount granted and deferred to a regulatory asset related to these programs was $3.8 million of the $6.8 million in total funds available.
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. On June 19, 2019, the Oregon legislature passed Senate Bill 98 (SB 98), which enables natural gas utilities to procure or develop RNG on behalf of their Oregon customers. The bill was signed into law by the governor in July 2019, and subsequently, the OPUC opened a docket in August 2019 regarding the rules for the bill. After working with parties, the OPUC adopted final rules in July 2020.
SB 98 and the rules outline the following parameters for the RNG program including: setting voluntary goals for adding as much as 30% renewable natural gas into the state’s pipeline system by 2050; enabling gas utilities to invest in and own the cleaning
and conditioning equipment required to bring raw biogas and landfill gas up to pipeline quality, as well as the facilities to connect to the local gas distribution system; and allowing up to 5% of a utility’s revenue requirement to be used to cover the incremental cost or investment in renewable natural gas infrastructure.
Further, the new law supports all forms of renewable natural gas including renewable hydrogen, which is made from excess wind, solar and hydro power. Renewable hydrogen can be used for the transportation system, industrial use, or blended into the natural gas pipeline system.
CORPORATE ACTIVITY TAX. In 2019, the State of Oregon enacted a Corporate Activity Tax (CAT) that is applicable to all businesses with annual Oregon gross revenue in excess of $1 million. The CAT is in addition to the state's corporate income tax and imposes a 0.57% tax on certain Oregon gross receipts less a reduction for a portion of cost of goods sold or labor. The CAT legislation became effective September 29, 2019 and applied to calendar years beginning January 1, 2020. Under the terms of the Order in NW Natural's 2020 Oregon general rate case, NW Natural is authorized to begin to recover the expense associated with the CAT as a component of base rates. NW Natural is also directed to adjust the amount recovered for the CAT in each annual PGA to reflect changes in gross revenue and cost of goods sold that occur as a result of the PGA.
The Order also provides for certain adjustments if there are legislative, rulemaking, judicial, or policy decisions that would cause the calculation methodology used by NW Natural for the CAT to vary in a fundamental way. Additionally, the CAT deferred from January 2020 through June 2020 was added to and amortized over the 2020-21 PGA gas year, and the CAT amounts deferred from July 2020 through the effective date of the rate case will be amortized over the 2021-22 PGA year.
WATER UTILITIES. In 2021, NW Holdings, through its water subsidiaries, continued acquiring water utilities. NW Holdings purchased an ownership stake in Avion Water Company, Inc., the largest investor-owned water utility in Oregon, and closed on four other transactions in Washington and Idaho, representing approximately 6,500 connections. NW Holdings signed two additional agreements in Texas and Arizona representing approximately 25,500 connections. For our acquired water utilities, we have been executing general rate cases, and in 2021, we completed rate cases in Idaho, Oregon and Washington and filed a general rate case for Sunriver Water in Oregon to support infrastructure investments for safety and reliability. In January 2022, Sunriver Water entered into a settlement agreement with all parties in its rate case, subject to OPUC approval, with new rates effective May 2022.
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN (IRP). NW Natural generally files a full IRP biennially for Oregon and Washington with the OPUC and WUTC, respectively. NW Natural jointly filed its 2018 IRP for both Oregon and Washington in August 2018, and received both a letter of compliance from the WUTC and acknowledgment by the OPUC in February 2019. The 2018 IRP included analysis of different scenarios, examining several potential future states and the corresponding least cost, least risk resource acquisition strategies. In addition to these strategies, the 2018 IRP published an emissions forecast for each of these potential futures. NW Natural filed an update to the 2018 IRP in March 2021 and received acknowledgement of the requested capital projects by the OPUC in September 2021.
The development of an IRP filing is an extensive and complex process that engages multiple stakeholders in an effort to build a robust and commonly understood analysis. The final product is intended to provide a long-term outlook of the supply-side and demand-side resource and compliance requirements for reliable and low cost natural gas service. The IRP examines and analyses uncertainties in the planning process, including potential changes in governmental and regulatory policies. As a result of the executive order (EO) issued by the governor of Oregon, new regulations and requirements have been developed resulting in a new program known as the Climate Protection Plan. The Washington Department of Ecology is currently undergoing rule-making for the Climate Commitment Act. Both of these policies have the potential to impact long-term resource decisions. In order to reflect the outcomes of the EO proceedings, the time to file NW Natural's next full IRP was extended to July 2022 as approved by the OPUC and WUTC.
PIPELINE SECURITY. In May and July 2021, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released two security directives applicable to certain notified owners and operators of natural gas pipeline facilities (including local distribution companies) that TSA has determined to be critical. The first security directive required notified owners/operators to implement cybersecurity incident reporting to the DHS, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, and perform a gap assessment of current entity cybersecurity practices against certain voluntary TSA security guidelines and report relevant results and proposed mitigation to applicable DHS agencies. The second security directive requires notified entities to implement a significant number of specified cyber security controls and processes. NW Natural is currently in the process of evaluating and implementing the security directives while ensuring safe and reliable operations. The impact on operations or an estimate or range of possible costs cannot be determined at this time. NW Natural is providing frequent updates to the TSA on NW Natural's progress on achieving the security directives. NW Natural filed requests with the OPUC and WUTC to defer the costs associated with complying with the second security directive and plans to seek recovery of these costs in future ratemaking proceedings. As of December 31, 2021, NW Natural has deferred to a regulatory asset $1.0 million of costs incurred to date.
ERP UPGRADE DEFERRALS. In the fourth quarter of 2020, NW Natural filed requests to defer expenses pertaining to a project to upgrade the existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system with the OPUC and WUTC. A stipulation supported by all parties in the Oregon docket was filed and approved by the OPUC in the third quarter of 2021. Under the settlement agreement, NW Natural can recover 100% of costs incurred up to the $8.55 million estimate of Oregon-allocated costs provided in the docket.
For costs that exceed $8.55 million up to $12 million, 80% may be recovered from customers. For costs that exceed $12 million, 50% may be recovered. As of December 31, 2021, NW Natural deferred to a regulatory asset $6.7 million of expenses incurred to date. Approval of the Washington deferral was resolved as part of the most recent general rate case.
Environmental, Legislation and Regulation Matters
There is a growing international and domestic focus on climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, most notably methane and carbon dioxide, to climate change. In response, there are increasing efforts at the international, federal, state, and local level to regulate GHG emissions. Legislation or other forms of regulation could take a variety of forms including, but not limited to, GHG emissions limits, reporting requirements, carbon taxes, requirements to purchase carbon credits, building codes, increased efficiency standards, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions, incentives or mandates to conserve energy, or use renewable energy sources, tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources, mandates for the use of specific fuels or technologies, or promotion of research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. These efforts could include legislation, legislative proposals, or new regulations at the federal, state, and local level, as well as private party litigation related to GHG emissions. We recognize certain of our businesses, including our natural gas business, are likely to be affected by current or future regulation seeking to limit GHG emissions.
International
In early 2021, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate, which establishes non-binding targets to reduce GHG emissions from both developed and developing nations. Under the Paris Agreement, signatory countries are expected to submit their nationally determined contributions to curb GHG emissions and meet the agreed temperature objectives every five years. On April 22, 2021, the United States federal administration announced the U.S. nationally determined contribution to achieve a fifty to fifty-two percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030.
Federal
President Biden’s administration has issued executive orders directing agencies to conduct a general review of regulations and executive actions related to the environment and reestablished a framework for considering the social cost of carbon as part of certain agency cost-benefit analyses for new regulations. President Biden’s administration continues to consider a wide range of additional policies, executive orders, rules, legislation, and other initiatives to address climate change. Some of these initiatives may include repeal of policies, executive orders or rules implemented by the prior administration.
The U.S. Congress has not yet passed any federal climate change legislation and we cannot predict when or if Congress will pass such legislation and in what form. In the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates GHG emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. In September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain industries, specified large GHG emission sources, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalents per year. NW Natural began reporting emission information in 2011. Under this reporting rule, local natural gas distribution companies like NW Natural are required to report system throughput to the EPA on an annual basis. The EPA also has required additional GHG reporting regulations to which NW Natural is subject, requiring the annual reporting of fugitive emissions from operations. Additionally, other federal regulatory agencies are beginning to address greenhouse gas emissions through changes in their regulatory oversight approach and policies.
Washington State
Approximately 11% of NW Natural’s revenues and 27% of new meters are attributable to Washington. Effective February 1, 2021, building codes in Washington state require new residential homes to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency based on specified carbon emissions assumptions, which calculate electric appliances to have lower on-site GHG emissions than comparable gas appliances. This increases the cost of new home construction incorporating natural gas depending on a number of factors including home size, equipment configurations, and building envelope measures. Additionally, changes to commercial codes have been proposed that, if adopted as currently drafted, could restrict or eliminate the use of gas space and water heating in new commercial construction beginning in July 2023. The Washington legislature is discussing matters relating to climate change and the use of natural gas during their 2022 legislative session. NW Natural is working with policymakers and a coalition of utilities, labor groups and business coalitions in Washington to help them understand the role of direct use natural gas, and in the coming years renewable natural gas and hydrogen, can play in pursuing more effective policies to reduce GHGs while preserving reliability, resiliency, energy choice, equity, and energy affordability.
Washington has also enacted the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), which establishes a comprehensive program that includes an overall limit for GHG emissions from major sources in the state that declines yearly beginning on January 1, 2023, resulting in an overall reduction of GHG emissions to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The Washington Department of Ecology has been directed to develop rules to create a cap-and-invest program, under which entities, including natural gas and electric utilities, and transportation and other fuel providers, which are subject to the CCA must either reduce their emissions or obtain allowances to cover any remaining emissions. These rules are expected by the end of 2022. NW Natural is subject to the CCA and intends to pursue inclusion of CCA compliance costs in rates.
Oregon State
On March 10, 2020, the governor of Oregon issued an executive order (EO) establishing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals of at least 45% below 1990 emission levels by 2035 and at least 80% below 1990 emission levels by 2050 and directed state agencies and commissions to facilitate such GHG emission goals targeting a variety of sources and industries. Although the EO does not specifically direct actions of natural gas distribution businesses, the OPUC is directed to prioritize proceedings and activities that advance decarbonization in the utility sector, mitigate the energy burden experienced by utility customers and ensure system reliability and resource adequacy. The EO also directs other state agencies, including the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) and OPUC, to cap and reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels and all other liquid and gaseous fuels, including natural gas, adopt building energy efficiency goals for new building construction, reduce methane gas emissions from landfills and food waste, and submit a proposal for adoption of state goals for carbon sequestration and storage by Oregon’s forest, wetlands and agricultural lands.
In December 2021, the ODEQ concluded its rulemaking process and issued final cap and reduce rules for its Climate Protection Program (CPP), which became effective in January of 2022. The CPP outlines GHG emissions reduction goals of 50% by 2035 and 90% by 2050 from a 1990 baseline. The first three-year compliance period is 2022 through 2024. NW Natural is subject to the CPP, and pursuant to this rule, is required to make its first compliance filing in 2025. We intend to pursue inclusion of compliance costs for the CPP in rates. We also expect the CPP to be subject to legal challenge from a number of stakeholders.
NW Natural is also engaged in an OPUC Fact-Finding (“Fact-Finding Docket”), opened in response to the EO for the purpose of analyzing the potential natural gas utility bill impacts that may result from the ODEQ’s CPP and to identify appropriate regulatory tools to mitigate potential customer impacts. The OPUC Staff has indicated that the ultimate goal of the Fact-Finding Docket is to inform future policy decisions and other key analyses to be considered in 2022, after the CPP is in place. We expect the Oregon Commission to issue a final report in 2022.
The Oregon legislature is discussing matters relating to climate change and the use of natural gas during their 2022 legislative session. NW Natural is working with policymakers and a coalition of utilities in Oregon to help stakeholders understand the role direct use natural gas, and in the coming years renewable natural gas and hydrogen, can play in pursuing more effective policies to reduce greenhouse gases while preserving reliability, resiliency, energy choice, equity, and energy affordability.
Local Jurisdictions and Other Advocacy
In addition to legislative activities at the state level, ballot measures may be proposed by advocacy groups. Some local and county governments in the United States also have been proposing or passing renewable energy resolutions, restrictions, taxes, or fees with advocates seeking to accelerate renewable energy goals. A number of cities across the country, and several in our service territory are currently considering such actions aimed at formalizing climate action goals, including limitations or bans on the use of natural gas in new construction or otherwise. NW Natural is actively engaged with such cities, local governments, and other advocates, including, among others the city of Eugene, Oregon, in our service territory and is working with these communities to help them understand the ways in which the natural gas system, and renewable fuels, can help them meet their decarbonization goals.
NW Natural Decarbonization Initiatives & Actions
Our customers are currently paying less for their natural gas today than they did 15 years ago. We expect that compliance with any form of regulation of GHG emissions, including the CPP in Oregon and CCA in Washington as well as voluntary actions under SB 98, will require additional resources and compliance tools. The developing and changing carbon credit markets and other compliance tool options, decades-long timeframes for compliance, likely changing and evolving laws and energy policy, and evolving technological advancements, all make it difficult to accurately predict long-term tools for and costs of compliance. Given that CCA rules are in development and the recency of the adoption of the final CPP rules, we have not completed our full integrated resources planning process to identify our compliance obligations and expected costs. Even as we develop these compliance and cost projections, they will be uncertain and subject to significant change over the nearly 30-year time horizon. It is our current expectation that costs associated with compliance generally would be recovered in rates and would result in an increase in the prices charged to customers. The CPP in Oregon is largely tied to the volume of natural gas consumed and as such, we currently expect that CPP cost impacts will be the lowest among residential customers because they generally consume less and highest among industrial customers that use significantly higher volumes of natural gas, with cost increases for commercial customers falling between residential and industrial customers. The projected customer bill impact of the CPP varies significantly based on forecasting assumptions related to permitted levels of rate recovery, available technologies and equipment, weather patterns and gas usage, customer growth or attrition, allocation of fixed costs among classes of customers, energy efficiency levels, availability, use and cost of renewables, feasibility of broad-scale hydrogen in the natural gas system, and a number of other assumptions used in the complex analysis of integrated resource planning.
It is difficult to assess whether building codes making use of natural gas more expensive for home builders or higher customer bills as compliance costs are included in rates will affect the competitiveness of our business or result in a decline in demand for natural gas. Both developments could negatively affect our gas utility customer growth. At the same time natural gas utilities will be subject to GHG emissions regulation, we expect that other energy source providers will be subject to similar, or in some cases stricter or more rapid, compliance requirements that are likely to affect their cost and competitiveness relative to natural gas as well. For example, President Biden has announced his intention to have a carbon-free electricity sector by 2035, 15 years before the target date of the CCA or CCP. In June 2021, the State of Oregon enacted HB 2021, a clean electricity bill that requires the
state’s two largest investor-owned electric utilities and retail electricity service suppliers to reduce GHG emissions associated with electricity sold to Oregon customers to 100 percent below baseline levels by 2040 with interim steps, including an 80 percent reduction by 2030 and 90 percent reduction by 2035. This bill does not replace the separate renewable portfolio standards previously established in Oregon, which sets requirements for how much of the electricity used in Oregon must come from renewable resources. In Washington, SB 5116, the Clean Energy Transformation Act, requires all electric utilities in Washington to transition to carbon-neutral electricity by 2030 and to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045. We expect that compliance with these and other laws will substantially increase the cost of energy for electric customers in our service territory. We are not able to determine at this time whether increased electricity costs will make natural gas use more or less competitive on a relative basis.
We expect these and other trends to drive innovation of, and demand for, technological developments and innovative new products that reduce GHG emissions. Research and development are occurring across the energy sector, including in the gas sector with work being conducted on gas-fired heat pumps, higher efficiency water and space heating appliances including hybrid systems, carbon capture and development, continued development of technologies related to RNG, and various forms of hydrogen for different applications, among others.
NW Natural continues to take proactive steps in seeking to reduce GHG emissions in our region and is proactively communicating with local, state, and federal governments and communities about those steps. NW Natural has been a leader among gas utilities in innovative programs. Notable programs have included a decoupling rate structure designed to weaken the link between earnings and gas consumption by customer adopted in 2007, and establishment of a voluntary Smart Energy carbon offset program for customers established in 2007, and removal of all known cast iron and bare steel to create one of the tightest and most modern distribution systems in the country. We continue to believe that NW Natural has an important role in providing affordable and equitable energy to the communities we serve. NW Natural is an important provider of energy to families and businesses in Oregon and southwest Washington. Yet, the sales of natural gas to our residential and commercial customers account for approximately 6% of Oregon’s GHG emissions according to data for recent years from the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality In-Boundary GHG Inventory. We intend to continue to provide this necessary energy to our communities with the goal of using our modern pipeline system to help the Pacific Northwest transition to a clean energy future.
In 2016, NW Natural initiated a multi-pronged, multi-year strategy to accelerate and deliver greater GHG emission reductions in the communities we serve. Key components of this strategy include customer energy efficiency, continued adoption of NW Natural's voluntary Smart Energy carbon offset program, and seeking to incorporate RNG and hydrogen into our gas supply. RNG is produced from organic materials including food, agricultural and forestry waste, wastewater, or landfills. We believe RNG has powerful potential to reduce net GHG emissions. Methane that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere is captured from these organic materials as they decompose and is conditioned to pipeline quality, so it can be added into the existing natural gas system. In 2019, Oregon Senate Bill 98 (SB 98) was signed into law enabling NW Natural to procure RNG on behalf of customers and provided voluntary targets that would allow us to make qualified investments and purchase RNG from third parties.
Under SB 98,NW Natural is actively working to procure RNG supply for customers and is engaging in longer-term efforts to increase the amount of RNG on our system and explore the development of renewable hydrogen through power to gas. To that end, in 2020 and 2021, NW Natural announced several agreements and investments to procure RNG for its customers. In addition, NW Natural began a partnership with BioCarbN to invest up to an estimated $38 million in four separate RNG development projects that will access biogas derived from water treatment at Tyson Foods’ processing plants, subject to approval by all parties. The first project was commissioned in early 2022 with a second underway and planned to be commissioned in early 2023. To date, NW Natural has signed agreements with options to purchase or develop RNG for utility customers totaling about 3% of NW Natural’s annual sales volume in Oregon.
Business Segment - Natural Gas Distribution (NGD)
NGD margin results are primarily affected by customer growth, revenues from rate-base additions, and, to a certain extent, by changes in delivered volumes due to weather and customers’ gas usage patterns. In Oregon, NW Natural has a conservation tariff (also called the decoupling mechanism), which adjusts margin up or down each month through a deferred regulatory accounting adjustment designed to offset changes resulting from increases or decreases in average use by residential and commercial customers. NW Natural also has a weather normalization tariff in Oregon, WARM, which adjusts customer bills up or down to offset changes in margin resulting from above- or below-average temperatures during the winter heating season. Residential and commercial customers in Oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism, and as of December 31, 2021, approximately 8% of total eligible customers had opted out. NW Natural does not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for Washington customers, which account for about 12% of total customers. The decoupling and WARM mechanisms are designed to reduce, but not eliminate, the volatility of customer bills and natural gas distribution earnings. See "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms" above. In addition to NW Natural's local gas distribution business, the NGD segment also includes the portion of the Mist underground storage facility used to serve NGD customers, the North Mist gas storage expansion, NWN Gas Reserves, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Corp., and NW Natural RNG Holding Company, LLC.
The NGD business is primarily seasonal in nature due to higher gas usage by residential and commercial customers during the cold winter heating months. Other categories of customers experience seasonality in their usage but to a lesser extent. Seasonality affects the comparability of the results of operations of the NGD business across quarters but not across years.
NGD segment highlights include:
(1) See Natural Gas Distribution Margin Table below for additional detail.
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. NGD net income was $69.0 million in 2021 compared to $63.6 million in 2020. The primary factors contributing to the increase in NGD net income were as follows:
•$41.7 million increase in NGD margin primarily due to:
▪$36.4 million increase due to new customer rates primarily from the 2020 Oregon rate case that went into effect November 1, 2020;
▪$5.7 million increase from residential customer growth and an increase in industrial customer volumes; partially offset by
▪$3.6 million decrease primarily driven by a loss from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism in Oregon.
In addition to the increase in margin, NGD net income for 2021 reflects:
•$19.3 million increase in other NGD operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to higher information technology expenses, compensation and benefits costs, and lease expense;
•$8.9 million increase in depreciation expense due to NGD plant additions as we continued to invest in our gas utility system;
•$5.3 million higher income tax expense reflecting higher pretax income and Oregon CAT; and
•$3.3 million increase in general taxes due primarily to higher assessed property values; partially offset by
•$2.7 million increase in other income (expense), net primarily due to higher interest income on regulatory assets.
Total natural gas sold and delivered in 2021 increased 4% over 2020 primarily due to the recovery of commercial customer activity as pandemic restrictions lifted compared to the prior period and NGD meter growth.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. NGD net income was $63.6 million in 2020 compared to $60.8 million in 2019. The primary factors contributing to the increase in NGD net income were as follows:
•$15.4 million increase in NGD margin primarily due to:
▪$17.7 million increase due to new customer rates from the 2020 Oregon and 2019 Washington rate cases;
▪$7.6 million increase from revenue generated from NW Natural's North Mist storage contract which commenced service in May 2019 and is included within other regulated services within NGD margin; and
▪$3.9 million increase from customer growth; partially offset by
▪$7.1 million decrease due to revenue recognized in 2019 as part of the settlement and recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which was entirely offset by pension expenses within operations and maintenance expense and other income (expense), net, and which did not recur in 2020;
▪$4.0 million decrease primarily due to lower overrun and entitlement fees;
▪$2.7 million decrease driven by warmer than average weather in 2020 compared average weather in 2019; and
▪$1.3 million decrease related to the temporary suspension of late fees during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to the increase in margin, NGD net income for 2020 reflects:
•a benefit of $12.5 million from pension expenses recognized in 2019 associated with recoveries of NW Natural's pension balancing account which did not recur in 2020. Approximately $4.6 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $7.9 million was recorded in other income (expense), net; and
•a benefit of $10.5 million from a 2019 regulatory pension disallowance which did not recur in 2020. Approximately $3.9 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $6.6 million was recorded in other income (expense), net.
The increases in net income above are partially offset by the following:
•$8.2 million increase in operations and maintenance expense related to higher compensation costs, contractor expenses, and moving and lease costs for a new headquarters and operations center;
•$13.8 million increase in depreciation and general tax expenses due to NGD plant additions, including the North Mist gas storage facility;
•$7.3 million decrease in other income (expense), net primarily related to interest income recognized in 2019 associated with the 2019 recoveries of the pension balancing account and ongoing regulatory amortization of the remaining pension balancing account deferral, which began in April 2019; and
•$6.9 million higher income tax reflecting a non-recurring tax benefit associated with the March 2019 Oregon order, partially offset by the ongoing amortization of TCJA benefits.
Total natural gas sold and delivered in 2020 decreased 6% over 2019 primarily due to the impact of weather that was 12% warmer than average in 2020 compared to weather that was average in 2019.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION MARGIN TABLE. The following table summarizes the composition of NGD gas volumes, revenues, and cost of sales:
(1) Amounts reported as NGD margin for each category of meters are operating revenues less cost of gas, environmental remediation expense and revenue taxes.
(2) Other margin adjustments include net revenue recoveries of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 associated with the decline of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.
(3) Heating degree days are units of measure reflecting temperature-sensitive consumption of natural gas, calculated by subtracting the average of a day's high and low temperatures from 59 degrees Fahrenheit.
(4) Average weather represents the 25-year average of heating degree days. Beginning November 1, 2020, average weather is calculated over the period June 1, 1994 through May 31, 2019, as determined in NW Natural’s 2020 Oregon general rate case. From November 1, 2018 through October 31, 2020, average weather was calculated over the period May 31, 1992 through May 30, 2017, as determined in NW Natural's 2018 Oregon general rate case.
Residential and Commercial Sales
The primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are customer growth, seasonal weather patterns, energy prices, competition from other energy sources, and economic conditions in our service areas. The impact of weather on margin is significantly reduced through NW Natural's weather normalization mechanism in Oregon; approximately 81% of NW Natural's total customers are covered under this mechanism. The remaining customers either opt out of the mechanism or are located in Washington, which does not have a similar mechanism in place. For more information on the weather mechanism, see "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-WARM" above.
NGD residential and commercial sales highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. The increase of $69.5 million in total residential and commercial operating revenue and $44.3 million in NGD margin were primarily the result of new customer rates in Oregon that took effect on November 1, 2020, growth in residential customer meters, and higher commercial volumes as COVID-19 restrictions and closures were lifted. Sales volumes increased 25.8 million therms, or 4%, primarily due to growth in residential customer meters and higher commercial volumes as COVID-19 restrictions and closures were lifted.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. The increase of $22.4 million in operating revenue and $19.0 million in total residential and commercial NGD margin were primarily the result of new customer rates resulting from the Oregon and Washington rate cases and customer growth. Sales volume decreased 57.0 million therms, or 8%, primarily due to warmer than average weather in 2020 compared to average weather in 2019 and lower usage from commercial customers related to the pandemic, partially offset by residential customer growth.
Industrial Sales and Transportation
Industrial customers have the option of purchasing sales or transportation services. Under the sales service, the customer buys the gas commodity from NW Natural. Under the transportation service, the customer buys the gas commodity directly from a third-party gas marketer or supplier. The NGD gas commodity cost is primarily a pass-through cost to customers; therefore, NGD profit margins are not materially affected by an industrial customer's decision to purchase gas from third parties. Industrial and large commercial customers may also select between firm and interruptible service options, with firm services generally providing higher profit margins compared to interruptible services. To help manage gas supplies, industrial tariffs are designed to provide some certainty regarding industrial customers' volumes by requiring an annual service election which becomes effective November 1, special charges for changes between elections, and in some cases, a minimum or maximum volume requirement before changing options.
NGD industrial sales and transportation highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. NGD total industrial sales and transportation volumes increased 16.1 million therms, or 3%, primarily due to higher usage from multiple customers, most notably in the pulp and paper and chemical manufacturing industries. NGD margin increased $1.4 million primarily driven by new rates in Oregon that took effect on November 1, 2020.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. NGD volumes decreased by 15.2 million therms, or 3%, and margin decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to lower usage from a small number of industrial customers.
Other Regulated Services Margin
Other Regulated Services primarily consist of lease revenues from NW Natural's North Mist storage facility as well as other lease revenues for compressed natural gas assets.
Other regulated services margin highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Other regulated services margin was relatively flat when compared to the prior period. The North Mist facility did not experience any significant fluctuations in storage service revenue. See Note 7 for more information regarding North Mist expansion lease accounting.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Other regulated services margin increased $7.0 million due to the commencement of storage services at the North Mist expansion facility in May 2019.
Cost of Gas
Cost of gas as reported by the NGD segment includes gas purchases, gas withdrawn from storage inventory, gains and losses from commodity hedges, pipeline demand costs, seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments, renewable thermal certificate costs, regulatory gas cost deferrals, gas reserves costs, and company gas use. The OPUC and WUTC generally require natural gas commodity costs to be billed to customers at the actual cost incurred, or expected to be incurred. Customer rates are set each year so that if cost estimates were met the NGD business would not earn a profit or incur a loss on gas commodity purchases; however, in Oregon we have the incentive sharing mechanism described under "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment" above. In addition to the PGA incentive sharing mechanism, gains and losses from hedge contracts entered into after annual PGA rates are effective for Oregon customers are also required to be shared and therefore may impact net income. Further, NW Natural also has a regulatory agreement whereby it earns a rate of return on its investment in the gas reserves acquired under the original agreement with Encana and includes gas from the amended gas reserves agreement at a fixed rate of $0.4725 per therm, which are also reflected in NGD margin. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" below.
Cost of gas highlights include:
(1) This calculation excludes volumes delivered to industrial transportation customers.
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Cost of gas increased $29.5 million, or 11%, primarily due to a $3.4 million loss from gas cost incentive sharing driven by costs related to the 2021 cold weather event that were not deferred for future recovery. The remaining increase in cost of gas is primarily the result of a 4% increase in volumes sold driven by customer growth and higher commercial volumes as COVID-19 restrictions and closures were lifted. For a discussion of the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism, see "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment" above.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Cost of gas increased by $7.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to a 13% increase in average cost of gas consistent with higher gas costs in the PGA; partially offset by a 7% decrease in volumes sold driven primarily by 12% warmer than average weather during 2020 as compared to average weather in 2019.
Other
Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Holdings include NNG Financial's investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline); NW Natural Renewables Holdings, LLC and its non-regulated renewable natural gas activities; and NWN Water, which owns and continues to pursue investments in the water sector. Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Natural include the non-NGD storage activity at Mist as well as asset management services and the appliance retail center
operations. See Note 4 for further discussion of our business segment and other, as well as our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
On August 6, 2020, NWN Energy completed the sale of its interest in Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH) to an unrelated third party. See Note 13 for further details.
At Mist, NW Natural provides gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of NGD customers’ requirements. Pre-tax income from gas storage at Mist and asset management services is subject to revenue sharing with NGD customers. Under this regulatory incentive sharing mechanism, NW Natural retains 80% of pre-tax income from Mist gas storage services and asset management services when the underlying costs of the capacity being used are not included in NGD business rates. The remaining 20% is credited to a deferred regulatory account for credit to NGD customers. To the extent that the capacity used is included in NGD rates, NW Natural retains 10% of pre-tax income from such storage and asset management services and 90% is credited to NGD business customers.
The following table presents the results of activities aggregated and reported as other for both NW Holdings and NW Natural:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Other net income increased $3.0 million and $5.2 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The increase at NW Natural was primarily due to $7.9 million of higher asset management revenue primarily related to the 2021 cold weather event, partially offset by $2.1 million of income tax expense associated with the higher revenue. The increase at NW Holdings was driven by the increase at NW Natural, partially offset by higher business development and consulting costs at the holding company.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Other net income increased $2.2 million and decreased $1.1 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The decrease at NW Natural was primarily due to lower earnings from non-NGD gas storage operations at Mist as a result of less favorable market conditions. The increase at NW Holdings was driven by higher earnings from water and wastewater utilities and lower expenses at the holding company, partially offset by the decline in other for NW Natural.
Consolidated Operations
Operations and Maintenance
Operations and maintenance highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Operations and maintenance expense increased $19.9 million for NW Natural primarily due to the following:
•$7.4 million increase in contractor, professional service fees and license costs related to information technology system upgrades;
•$4.8 million increase related to higher compensation and benefit costs; and
•$3.6 million increase in lease expense related to a new headquarters and operations center.
Operations and maintenance expense increased $24.1 million for NW Holdings primarily due to the following:
•$4.2 million increase in other NW Holdings operations and maintenance expense primarily due to higher business development and consulting costs at the holding company; and
•$19.9 million increase in operations and maintenance expense at NW Natural as discussed above.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Operations and maintenance expense decreased $0.2 million for NW Natural primarily due to the following:
•$7.4 million decrease reflecting pension expense (service cost component) recognized as part of the recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account settlement in the Oregon rate case, which did not recur in 2020 as discussed below; and
•$0.6 million decrease in workers compensation expense as a result of fewer claims in 2020; partially offset by
•$4.5 million increase in contractor and professional service expenses, and moving costs, as we moved to a new headquarters and operations center;
•$1.6 million increase related to higher compensation costs attributable to annual employee cost increases; and
•$1.4 million increase due to higher lease expense for the new headquarters and operations center.
Operations and maintenance expense in 2020 excludes approximately $2.9 million of COVID-19 related expenses that were deferred to a regulatory asset. In addition, to mitigate the effects of the financial implications of COVID-19, management implemented temporary cost savings initiatives, which resulted in approximately $3.5 million of operations and maintenance expense savings.
Operations and maintenance expense increased $1.9 million for NW Holdings primarily due to the following:
•$2.2 million increase in other NW Holdings operations and maintenance expense primarily due to operating expenses at our water and wastewater utilities that have been acquired since 2019; partially offset by
•$0.2 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense at NW Natural as discussed above.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.9 million for NW Natural, primarily due to additional capital investments in the distribution system, Mist storage, and information technology systems, as well as renovation and construction of resource and operations service centers.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.8 million for NW Holdings, primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in other NW Holdings depreciation and amortization related to water and wastewater acquisitions and an $8.9 million increase at NW Natural as discussed above.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.2 million for NW Natural, primarily due to NGD plant additions and the North Mist gas storage facility that began operations and depreciating in May 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.2 million for NW Holdings, primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in other NW Holdings depreciation and amortization related to water and wastewater acquisitions and an $11.2 million increase at NW Natural as discussed above.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Other income (expense), net changed $2.4 million at NW Natural primarily due to higher interest income on regulatory assets and lower pension non-service costs. Other income (expense), net changed $1.3 million at NW Holdings driven by the change at NW Natural discussed above, partially offset by a gain recognized in the prior period related to the sale of Trail West. Other income (expense), net primarily consists of regulatory interest, pension and other postretirement non-service costs, gains from company-owned life insurance, and donations.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Other income (expense), net increased $7.9 million at NW Natural primarily due to higher 2019 pension expenses (non-service cost component) recognized as part of the settlement and recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which did not recur in 2020. Other income (expense), net increased $8.9 million at NW Holdings due to an increase of $1.0 million in other NW Holdings activity and a $7.9 million increase at NW Natural as discussed above.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Interest expense, net, increased $2.1 million at NW Natural primarily due to lower AFUDC debt interest income and higher interest on long-term debt.
Interest expense, net, increased $1.4 million at NW Holdings primarily due to the increase at NW Natural discussed above, partially offset by lower interest expense on the credit agreement at NW Holdings.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Interest expense, net, decreased $0.4 million at NW Natural primarily due to $1.7 million of lower interest on commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $0.6 million of higher interest on long-term debt balances. NW Natural deferred to a regulatory asset approximately $1.9 million of interest on financings undertaken in March 2020 as a precautionary measure to strengthen our liquidity position as the pandemic unfolded.
Interest expense, net, increased $0.4 million at NW Holdings primarily due to $0.8 million higher interest on outstanding credit agreement balances, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease at NW Natural as discussed above.
Income Tax Expense
NW Holdings income tax expense highlights include:
NW Natural income tax expense highlights include:
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. The effective tax rate increased 2.7 and 2.9 percentage points at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to Oregon Corporate Activity Tax, the majority of which is incurred because of Oregon regulated operations and for which rate recovery began on November 1, 2020.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. The effective tax rate increased 6.9 and 6.1 percentage points at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the 2019 tax implications of the March 2019 OPUC order, including the return of deferred Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefits to customers and the regulatory pension disallowance.
Discontinued Operations
On June 20, 2018, NWN Gas Storage, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement) that provided for the sale by NWN Gas Storage of all of its membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility.
On December 4, 2020, NWN Gas Storage closed the sale of all the memberships interests in Gill Ranch and received payment of the initial cash purchase price of $13.5 million less the $1.0 million deposit previously paid. Furthermore, additional payments to NWN Gas Storage may be made subject to a maximum amount of $15.0 million in the aggregate (subject to a working capital adjustment) based on the economic performance of Gill Ranch each full gas storage year (April 1 of one year through March 31 of the following year) occurring after the closing and the remaining portion of the 2020-2021 gas storage year and will continue until such time as the maximum amount has been paid. The fair value of this arrangement at the closing date was zero based on a discounted cash flow forecast. Subsequent changes in the fair value will be recorded in earnings. The completion of the sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The results of Gill Ranch Storage have been determined to be discontinued operations until the date of sale and are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of continuing operations of NW Holdings for all periods presented. See Note 18 for more information on the Agreement and the results of our discontinued operations.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Capital Structure
NW Holdings' long-term goal is to maintain a strong and balanced consolidated capital structure. NW Natural targets a regulatory capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt, which is consistent with approved regulatory allocations in Oregon, which has an allocation of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt without recognition of short-term debt, and Washington, which has an allocation of 50% long-term debt, 1% short-term debt, and 49% common equity.
When additional capital is required, debt or equity securities are issued depending on both the target capital structure and market conditions. These sources of capital are also used to fund long-term debt retirements and short-term commercial paper
maturities. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and Note 9. Achieving our target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements is necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and provide access to the capital markets at reasonable costs.
NW Holdings' consolidated capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:
NW Natural's consolidated long-term capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:
Including short-term debt balances, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, NW Holdings' consolidated capital structure included common equity of 39.5% and 41.4%, long-term debt of 44.0% and 40.0%, and short-term debt including current maturities of long-term debt of 16.5% and 18.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, NW Natural's consolidated capital structure included common equity of 44.2% and 42.1%, long-term debt of 44.7% and 43.2%, and short-term debt including current maturities of long-term debt of 11.1% and 14.7%, respectively.
During 2021, NW Natural's capital structure changed primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt and capital contributions from NW Holdings. NW Holdings' capital structure changed primarily due to issuances of common stock and increases in short-term debt at NW Holdings. See further discussion below in "Cash Flows - Financing Activities".
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, NW Holdings had approximately $18.6 million and $30.2 million, and NW Natural had approximately $12.3 million and $10.5 million, of cash and cash equivalents, respectively. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity during periods when capital markets are volatile, NW Holdings and NW Natural may elect to maintain higher cash balances and add short-term borrowing capacity. NW Holdings and NW Natural may also pre-fund their respective capital expenditures when long-term fixed rate environments are attractive. NW Holdings and NW Natural expect to have ample liquidity in the form of cash on hand and from operations and available credit capacity under credit facilities to support funding needs.
In August 2021, NW Holdings initiated an at-the-market (ATM) equity program by entering into an equity distribution agreement under which NW Holdings may issue and sell from time to time shares of common stock, no par value, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $200 million. NW Holdings is under no obligation to offer and sell common stock under the ATM equity program, which expires in August 2024. Any shares of common stock offered under the ATM equity program are registered on NW Holdings’ universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. During the year ended December 31, 2021, NW Holdings issued and sold 375,720 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM equity program resulting in cash proceeds of $17.5 million, net of fees and commissions paid to agents of $0.4 million. As of December 31, 2021, NW Holdings had issued and sold 375,720 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM equity program resulting in cash proceeds of $17.5 million, net of fees and commissions paid to agents of $0.4 million.
NW Holdings
For NW Holdings, short-term liquidity is primarily provided by cash balances, dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in particular NW Natural, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities. NW Holdings also has a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC for the issuance of debt and equity securities. NW Holdings long-term debt, if any, and equity issuances are primarily used to provide equity contributions to NW Holdings’ operating subsidiaries for operating and capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. Over the next three years, we estimate NW Holdings’ and NW Natural's combined incremental capital needs to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million. NW Holdings intends to use raised capital to support NW Natural, NW Natural Water, and NW Natural Renewables operating and capital expenditure programs. NW Holdings' issuance of securities is not subject to regulation by state public utility commissions, but the dividends from NW Natural to NW Holdings are subject to regulatory ring-fencing provisions. NW Holdings guarantees the debt of its wholly-owned subsidiary, NWN Water. See "Long-Term Debt" below for more information regarding NWN Water debt.
As part of the ring-fencing conditions agreed upon with the OPUC and WUTC, NW Natural may not pay dividends or make distributions to NW Holdings if NW Natural’s credit ratings and common equity ratio, defined as the ratio of equity to long-term
debt, fall below specified levels. If NW Natural’s long-term secured credit ratings are below A- for S&P and A3 for Moody’s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural’s common equity ratio is 45% or more. If NW Natural’s long term secured credit ratings are below BBB for S&P and Baa2 for Moody’s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural’s common equity ratio is 46% or more. Dividends may not be issued if NW Natural’s long-term secured credit ratings are BB+ or below for S&P or Ba1 or below for Moody’s, or if NW Natural’s common equity ratio is below 44%, where the ratio is measured using common equity and long-term debt excluding imputed debt or debt-like lease obligations. In each case, common equity ratios are determined based on a preceding or projected 13-month average. In addition, there are certain OPUC notice requirements for dividends in excess of 5% of NW Natural’s retained earnings.
Additionally, if NW Natural’s common equity (excluding goodwill and equity associated with non-regulated assets), on a preceding or projected 13-month average basis, is less than 46% of NW Natural’s capital structure, NW Natural is required to notify the OPUC, and if the common equity ratio falls below 44%, file a plan with the OPUC to restore its equity ratio to 44%. This condition is designed to ensure NW Natural continues to be adequately capitalized under the holding company structure. Under the WUTC order, the average common equity ratio must not exceed 56%.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NW Natural satisfied the ring-fencing provisions described above.
Based on several factors, including current cash reserves, committed credit facilities, its ability to receive dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in particular NW Natural, and an expected ability to issue long-term debt and equity securities in the capital markets, NW Holdings believes its liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near-term cash requirements, including all contractual obligations, investing, and financing activities as discussed in "Cash Flows" below.
NW HOLDINGS DIVIDENDS. Quarterly dividends have been paid on common stock each year since NW Holdings’ predecessor’s stock was first issued to the public in 1951. Annual common stock dividend payments per share, adjusted for stock splits, have increased each year since 1956. The declarations and amount of future dividends to shareholders will depend upon earnings, cash flows, financial condition, NW Natural’s ability to pay dividends to NW Holdings and other factors. The amount and timing of dividends payable on common stock is at the sole discretion of the NW Holdings Board of Directors.
NW Natural
For the NGD business segment, short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder winter months when the NGD business borrows money to cover the lag between natural gas purchases and bill collections from customers. Short-term liquidity for the NGD business is primarily provided by cash balances, internal cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes, as well as available cash from multi-year credit facilities, short-term credit facilities, company-owned life insurance policies, the sale of long-term debt, and equity contributions from NW Holdings. NW Natural's long-term debt and contributions from NW Holdings are primarily used to finance NGD capital expenditures, refinance maturing debt, and provide temporary funding for other general corporate purposes of the NGD business.
Based on its current debt ratings (see "Credit Ratings" below), NW Natural has been able to issue commercial paper and long-term debt at attractive rates. In the event NW Natural is not able to issue new long-term debt due to adverse market conditions or other reasons, NW Natural expects that near-term liquidity needs can be met using internal cash flows, issuing commercial paper, receiving equity contributions from NW Holdings, or drawing upon a committed credit facility. NW Natural also has a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC for the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities.
In the event senior unsecured long-term debt ratings are downgraded, or outstanding derivative positions exceed a certain credit threshold, counterparties under derivative contracts could require NW Natural to post cash, a letter of credit, or other forms of collateral, which could expose NW Natural to additional cash requirements and may trigger increases in short-term borrowings while in a net loss position. NW Natural was not required to post collateral at December 31, 2021. See "Credit Ratings" below and Note 15.
Other items that may have a significant impact on NW Natural's liquidity and capital resources include NW Natural's pension contribution requirements and environmental expenditures.
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS. NW Natural does not expect to make contributions to its company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new employees, over the next several years under applicable laws and regulations. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Pensions and Postretirement Benefits" below and Note 10 for more information.
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES. NW Natural expects to continue using cash resources to fund environmental liabilities for future environmental remediation or action. NW Natural has authorizations in Oregon and Washington to defer costs related to remediation of properties that are owned or were previously owned by NW Natural. In Oregon, a Site Remediation and Recovery Mechanism (SRRM) is currently in place to recover prudently incurred costs allocable to Oregon customers, subject to an earnings test. On October 21, 2019 the WUTC authorized an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) for recovery of prudently incurred costs allocable to Washington customers beginning November 1, 2019. See Note 17 and "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery" above.
Based on several factors, including current credit ratings, NW Natural's commercial paper program, current cash reserves, committed credit facilities, and an expected ability to issue long-term debt and receive equity contributions from NW Holdings, NW Natural believes its liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near-term cash requirements, including all contractual obligations, and investing and financing activities as discussed in "Cash Flows" below.
NW NATURAL DIVIDENDS. The declarations and amount of future dividends to NW Holdings will depend upon earnings, cash flows, financial condition, the satisfaction of OPUC and WUTC regulatory ring-fencing restrictions, and other factors. The amount and timing of dividends payable on common stock is subject to approval of the NW Natural Board of Directors.
Gas and Pipeline Capacity Purchase Agreements
NW Natural has signed agreements providing for the reservation of firm pipeline capacity under which it is required to make fixed monthly payments for contracted capacity. The pricing component of the monthly payment is established, subject to change, by U.S. or Canadian regulatory bodies, or is established directly with private counterparties, as applicable. In addition, NW Natural has entered into long-term agreements to release firm pipeline capacity. NW Natural also enters into short-term and long-term gas purchase agreements. Refer to Note 16 for gas and pipeline capacity purchase commitments.
NW Natural Renewables is a newly formed and non-utility regulated subsidiary of NW Natural Holdings established to pursue non-regulated renewable natural gas activities. In September 2021, a subsidiary of NW Natural Renewables and a subsidiary of EDL, a global producer of sustainable distributed energy, executed agreements to develop two production facilities that are designed to convert landfill waste gases to renewable natural gas (RNG). Testing and commissioning of the production facilities is expected to occur in 2023. Upon completion of each facility, the subsidiary of NW Natural Renewables is committed to make cash payments totaling $50.1 million to partially fund the infrastructure required to condition biogas and connect gas production to existing regional pipeline networks. Alongside these development agreements, a subsidiary of NW Natural Renewables and a subsidiary of EDL executed agreements designed to secure a 20-year supply of RNG for NW Natural Renewables. At December 31, 2021, the amount of RNG purchases based on prices and quantities specified in the agreements are as follows: approximately $9.2 million in 2023, $10.5 million in 2024, $21.0 million in 2025, $21.0 million in 2026 and $584.0 million thereafter.
Other Purchase Agreements
Other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders and gas storage agreements. At December 31, 2021, the amount due over the duration of the purchase agreements totaled $48.1 million. Except for these certain purchase commitments, NW Holdings and NW Natural have no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Short-Term Debt
The primary source of short-term liquidity for NW Holdings is cash balances, dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in particular NW Natural, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities it may enter into from time to time.
The primary source of short-term liquidity for NW Natural is from the sale of commercial paper, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities it may enter into from time to time. In addition to issuing commercial paper or entering into bank loans to meet working capital requirements, including seasonal requirements to finance gas purchases and accounts receivable, short-term debt may also be used to temporarily fund capital requirements. For NW Natural, commercial paper and bank loans are periodically refinanced through the sale of long-term debt or equity contributions from NW Holdings. Commercial paper, when outstanding, is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement and is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities. See “Credit Agreements” below.
In June 2021, NW Natural entered into a $100.0 million 364-Day Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan) and borrowed the full amount. All principal and interest under the Term Loan was repaid in December 2021.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NW Natural's short-term debt outstanding of $245.5 million and $231.5 million, respectively, consisted of commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NW Holdings' short-term debt outstanding of $389.5 million and $304.5 million, respectively, consisted of the commercial paper outstanding at NW Natural and $144.0 million and $73.0 million, respectively, of balances outstanding under the credit agreement at NW Holdings. The weighted average interest rate of commercial paper at NW Natural at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the credit agreement at NW Holdings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively.

NW Holdings has a $200 million sustainability-linked credit agreement, with a feature that allows it to request increases in the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $300 million. The maturity date of the agreement is November 3, 2026, with available extensions of commitments for two additional one-year periods, subject to lender approval.
All lenders under the NW Holdings credit agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2021 as follows:
Based on credit market conditions, it is possible one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to NW Holdings if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency; however, NW Holdings does not believe this risk to be imminent due to the lenders' strong investment-grade credit ratings.
The NW Holdings credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $40 million. The principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement is due and payable on the maturity date. The credit agreement requires NW Holdings to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Holdings was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2021 and 2020, with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of 60.5% and 58.6%, respectively.
The NW Holdings credit agreement also requires NW Holdings to maintain debt ratings (which are defined by a formula using NW Natural's credit ratings in the event NW Holdings does not have a credit rating) with Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and notify the lenders of any change in its senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt ratings, as applicable, by such rating agencies. A change in NW Holdings' debt ratings by S&P or Moody’s is not an event of default, nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement. Rather, interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreements are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreements when ratings are changed. NW Holdings does not currently maintain ratings with S&P or Moody's.
The NW Holdings credit agreement also includes a mechanism that can increase or decrease the undrawn interest rate by up to 1 basis point and undrawn interest rate by up to 5 basis points in accordance with NW Holdings’ independently verified achievement of quantifiable metrics related to two goals-one related to carbon savings and one related to in-line inspections of NW Natural’s transmission pipeline. Performance against these metrics is designed to be assessed annually with pricing adjustments, if any, resetting off of primary pricing annually and not cumulatively.
Interest charges on the NW Holdings credit agreement are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The agreement contains provisions addressing the end of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate of interest and a mechanism for determining an alternative benchmark rate of interest without an amendment to the credit agreement. If the provisions are triggered, LIBOR would be replaced by a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR)-based rate, if one can be determined, or, if not, LIBOR may be replaced by a rate selected by NW Holdings and the administrative agent under the agreement. The replacement rate is also subject to a spread adjustment which may be positive, negative or zero.
NW Holdings had no letters of credit issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
NW Natural
NW Natural has a sustainability-linked multi-year credit agreement for unsecured revolving loans totaling $400 million, with a feature that allows NW Natural to request increases in the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $600 million. The maturity date of the agreement is November 3, 2026 with an available extension of commitments for two additional one-year periods, subject to lender approval.
All lenders under the NW Natural credit agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2021 as follows:
Based on credit market conditions, it is possible one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to NW Natural if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency; however, NW Natural does not believe this risk to be imminent due to the lenders' strong investment-grade credit ratings.
The NW Natural credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $60 million. The principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement is due and payable on the maturity date. There were no outstanding
balances under this credit agreement at December 31, 2021 or 2020. The credit agreement requires NW Natural to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Natural was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2021 and 2020, with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of 55.8% and 57.9%, respectively.
The NW Natural credit agreement also requires NW Natural to maintain credit ratings with S&P and Moody’s and notify the lenders of any change in NW Natural's senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt ratings, as applicable, by such rating agencies. A change in NW Natural's debt ratings by S&P or Moody’s is not an event of default, nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement. Rather, interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreement are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreement when ratings are changed. See "Credit Ratings" below.
The NW Natural credit agreement also includes a mechanism that can increase or decrease the undrawn interest rate by up to 1 basis point and undrawn interest rate by up to 5 basis points in accordance with NW Natural’s independently verified achievement of quantifiable metrics related to two goals-one related to carbon savings and one related to in-line inspections of NW Natural’s transmission pipeline. Performance against these metrics is designed to be assessed annually with pricing adjustments, if any, resetting off of primary pricing annually and not cumulatively.
Interest charges on the NW Natural credit agreement are indexed to LIBOR. The agreement contains provisions addressing the end of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate of interest and a mechanism for determining an alternative benchmark rate of interest without an amendment to the credit agreement. If the provisions are triggered, LIBOR would be replaced by a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR)-based rate, if one can be determined, or, if not, LIBOR may be replaced by a rate selected by NW Natural and the administrative agent under the agreement. The replacement rate is also subject to a spread adjustment which may be positive, negative or zero.
Credit Ratings
NW Holdings does not currently maintain ratings with S&P or Moody's. NW Natural's credit ratings are a factor of liquidity, potentially affecting access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market. NW Natural's credit ratings also have an impact on the cost of funds and the need to post collateral under derivative contracts.
The following table summarizes NW Natural's current credit ratings:
The above credit ratings and ratings outlook are dependent upon a number of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of or reference to these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NW Holdings or NW Natural securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
As part of the ring-fencing conditions agreed upon with the OPUC and WUTC, NW Holdings and NW Natural are required to maintain separate credit ratings, long-term debt ratings, and preferred stock ratings, if any.
Long-Term Debt
Issuance of Long-Term Debt
In November 2021, NW Natural issued $130.0 million of First Mortgage Bonds (FMBs) with an interest rate of 3.08% due in 2051. Issued as a sustainability bond, net proceeds from the sale of the FMBs were added to the general funds of NW Natural and used for general corporate purposes, while an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds was or will be allocated to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, investments in one or more new or existing projects of NW Natural deemed to be an eligible project in the bond offering. Projects deemed eligible for the FMB offering included expenditures related to RNG and hydrogen generation and infrastructure, programs related to energy efficiency, expenditures related to operations or service centers that have or are expected to receive LEED Gold or Platinum certification, and expenditures and program investments related to enabling opportunities for diverse business enterprises.
In June 2021, NWN Water, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a five-year term loan agreement for $55.0 million. The loan carried an interest rate of 0.90% at December 31, 2021, which is based upon the one-month LIBOR rate. The loan is guaranteed by NW Holdings and requires NW Holdings to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and
accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Holdings was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2021, with a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 60.5%.
Retirement of Long-Term Debt
The following NW Natural debentures were retired in the periods indicated:
In June 2019, NW Natural Water, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a two-year term loan agreement for $35.0 million. The loan was repaid in June 2021 upon its maturity date.
Maturities and Interest on Long-Term Debt
Maturities and payment of interest on long-term debt for each of the annual periods through December 31, 2026 and thereafter are as follows:
Bankruptcy Ring-fencing Restrictions
As part of the ring-fencing conditions agreed upon with the OPUC and WUTC, NW Natural is required to have one director who is independent from NW Natural management and from NW Holdings and to issue one share of NW Natural preferred stock to an independent third party. NW Natural was in compliance with both of these ring-fencing provisions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. NW Natural may file a voluntary petition for bankruptcy only if approved unanimously by the Board of Directors of NW Natural, including the independent director, and by the holder of the preferred share.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Changes in our operating cash flows are primarily affected by net income or loss, changes in working capital requirements, and other cash and non-cash adjustments to operating results.
The significant drivers of changes in cash provided by operating activities discussed below apply to both NW Holdings and NW Natural.
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. The significant factors contributing to the $7.0 million decrease at NW Natural cash flow provided by operating activities were as follows:
•$58.1 million increase in net deferred gas costs as the actual costs during the 2020-21 winter season were 21% above the PGA estimates primarily due to the 2021 cold weather event as opposed to gas costs in the 2019-20 winter season that were in line with estimates embedded in the PGA,
•$26.5 million decrease due to increased receivables; partially offset by
•$51.7 million increase in the regulatory incentive sharing mechanism related to revenues earned from Mist gas storage and asset management activities primarily related to the 2021 cold weather event, and
•$19.4 million of lower contributions to the defined benefit pension plan.
The $15.1 million increase in NW Holdings cash flow provided by operating activities were driven by the above factors affecting NW Natural, in addition to:
•$14.0 million increase due to lower income and other taxes, and
•$9.7 million increase due to lower deferred environmental expenses.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. The significant factors contributing to the $40.7 million and $38.4 million decreases in NW Holdings and NW Natural cash flow provided by operating activities, respectively, were as follows:
•a decrease of $25.8 million at NW Natural from increased receivables;
•a decrease of $18.0 million due to higher contributions paid to qualified defined benefit pension plans;
•a decrease of $15.8 million from decreased cash collections from our decoupling mechanism; and
•a decrease of $11.6 million due to higher environmental expenditures; partially offset by
•a decrease of $41.1 million in net deferred gas costs as the actual costs during the 2019-20 winter season were in line with estimates embedded in the PGA as opposed to gas costs in the 2018-2019 winter season that were 14% above PGA estimates.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, NW Natural contributed $9.6 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan, compared to $29.0 million for 2020 and $11.0 million in 2019. The American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021, includes a provision for pension relief that extends the amortization period for required contributions from 7 to 15 years and provides for the stabilization of interest rates used to calculate future required contributions. As a result, NW Natural does not expect to make any plan contributions during 2022. The amount and timing of future contributions will depend on market interest rates and investment returns on the plans’ assets. See Note 10.
NW Holdings and NW Natural have lease and purchase commitments relating to our operating activities that are financed with cash flows from operations. For information on cash flow requirements related to leases and other purchase commitments, see Note 7 and Note 16.
Investing Activities
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Cash used in investing activities increased $11.6 million at NW Natural and $5.8 million at NW Holdings, respectively.
The increase at NW Natural is primary driven by an increase in capital expenditures of $12.2 million for customer growth, system reinforcement, and technology. The increase at NW Holdings is driven by the $14.5 million purchase of an equity method investment and $12.5 million of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations in the prior year, partially offset by a $37.0 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Cash used in investing activities decreased $9.5 million at NW Holdings and increased $21.0 million and NW Natural, respectively.
The decrease in cash used at NW Holdings was driven by $12.5 million of proceeds from the sale of Gill Ranch and $7.0 million from the sale of Trail West. The increase in cash used at NW Natural was due to continued capital expenditures for customer growth, system reinforcement, and technology, partially offset by lower leasehold improvement expenditures at the new corporate operations center and $8.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.
NW Natural capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be in the range of $310 million to $350 million and for the five-year period from 2022 to 2026 are expected to range from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. NW Natural Water is expected to invest approximately $15 million in 2022 related to maintenance capital expenditures for water and wastewater utilities owned as of December 31, 2021, and for the five-year period from 2022 to 2026 capital expenditures are expected to invest approximately $60 million to $70 million.
The timing and amount of the core capital expenditures and projects for 2022 and the next five years could change based on regulation, growth, and cost estimates. Additional investments in our infrastructure during and after 2022 that are not incorporated in the estimates provided above will depend largely on additional regulations, growth, and expansion opportunities. Required funds for the investments are expected to be internally generated or financed with long-term debt or equity, as appropriate.
Financing Activities
2021 COMPARED TO 2020. Cash provided by financing activities increased $16.9 million at NW Natural primarily driven by higher short-term debt borrowings of $297.6 million and $116.0 million in capital contributions by NW Holdings, partially offset by $390.1 million of lower proceeds from and repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days.
Cash provided by financing activities decreased $40.4 million at NW Holdings primarily due to $390.1 million of lower proceeds from and repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days, partially offset by higher other short-term debt borrowings of $319.6 million and cash proceeds of $17.5 million from the ATM equity program.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Cash provided by financing activities increased $56.3 million and $67.5 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively.
The increase in cash provided by financing activities at NW Natural was primarily driven by $198.8 million of higher borrowings of short-term debt, net, and $2.0 million of higher cash dividends paid. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $35.0 million in long-term debt borrowings and $93.2 million in capital contributions from NW Holdings to NW Natural in 2019.
The increase at NW Holdings was primarily due to $223.9 million higher in short-term borrowings, partially offset by decreases of $93.0 million in common stock issuance proceeds and $70.0 million lower repayments of long-term debt.
Pension Cost and Funding Status of Qualified Retirement Plans
NW Natural's pension costs are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pensions and Postretirement Benefits” below. Pension expense for NW Natural's qualified defined benefit plan, which is allocated between operations and maintenance expenses and capital expenditures totaled $16.6 million in 2021, a decrease of $1.8 million from 2020. The fair market value of pension assets in this plan increased to $399.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $373.9 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was due to a gain on plan assets of $38.7 million and $9.6 million in employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments of $23.0 million.
Contributions made to NW Natural's company-sponsored qualified defined benefit pension plan are based on actuarial assumptions and estimates, tax regulations, and funding requirements under federal law. The qualified defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by $104.7 million at December 31, 2021. The American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021, includes a provision for pension relief that extends the amortization period for required contributions from 7 to 15 years and provides for the stabilization of interest rates used to calculate future required contributions. As a result, NW Natural does not expect to make any plan contributions during 2022. The amount and timing of future contributions will depend on market interest rates and investment returns on the plan's assets. See Note 10 for information regarding employer contributions and estimated future benefit payments and other pension disclosures.
Contingent Liabilities
Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Environmental Contingencies” below. At December 31, 2021, NW Natural's total estimated liability related to environmental sites was $115.8 million. See Note 17 and "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery" above.
NW Holdings is not currently party to any direct claims or litigation, though in the future it may be subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
New Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 2.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
In preparing financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management exercises judgment to assess the potential outcomes and related accounting impacts in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of financial condition and results of operations and which require management’s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments, including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if reported under different conditions or used different assumptions. Our most critical estimates and judgments for both NW Holdings and NW Natural include accounting for:
•regulatory accounting;
•revenue recognition;
•derivative instruments and hedging activities;
•pensions and postretirement benefits;
•income taxes;
•environmental contingencies; and
•impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.
Management has discussed its current estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the Audit Committees of the Boards of NW Holdings and NW Natural. Within the context of critical accounting policies and estimates, management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Regulatory Accounting
The NGD segment is regulated by the OPUC and WUTC, which establish the rates designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services, and, to a certain extent, set forth special accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions for which NW Natural records regulatory assets and liabilities. In general, the same accounting principles as non-regulated companies reporting under U.S. GAAP are used. However, authoritative guidance for regulated operations (regulatory accounting) requires different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation. For example, NW Natural accounts for the cost of gas using a PGA deferral and cost recovery mechanism, which is submitted for approval annually to the OPUC and WUTC. See "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment" above. There are other expenses and revenues that the OPUC or WUTC may require NW Natural to defer for recovery or refund in future periods. Regulatory accounting requires NW Natural to account for these types of deferred expenses (or deferred revenues) as regulatory assets (or regulatory liabilities) on the balance sheet. When the recovery of these regulatory assets from, or refund of regulatory liabilities to, customers is approved, NW Natural recognizes the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time the adjustment to amounts included in rates charged to customers.
The conditions that must be satisfied to adopt the accounting policies and practices of regulatory accounting include:
•an independent regulator sets rates;
•the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and
•the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.
Because NW Natural's NGD operations satisfy all three conditions, NW Natural continues to apply regulatory accounting to NGD operations. Future accounting changes, regulatory changes, or changes in the competitive environment could require NW Natural to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting for some or all of our regulated businesses. This would require the write-off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers.
Based on current accounting and regulatory competitive conditions, NW Natural believes it is reasonable to expect continued application of regulatory accounting for NGD activities. Further, it is reasonable to expect the recovery or refund of NW Natural's regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021 through future customer rates. If it is determined that all or a portion of
these regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, then NW Natural would be required to write-off the net unrecoverable balances against earnings in the period such determination is made. The net balance in regulatory asset and liability accounts was a net liability of $382.7 million and $308.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 2 for more detail on regulatory balances.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale, transportation, and storage of natural gas, are recognized upon the delivery of gas commodity or services rendered to customers.
Accrued Unbilled Revenue
For a description of the policy regarding accrued unbilled revenue, most of which relates to the NGD business at NW Natural, see Note 2. The following table presents changes in key metrics if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at December 31 was adjusted up or down by 1%:
(1) Includes impact of regulatory mechanisms including decoupling mechanism and excludes the impact of unbilled revenue from water services.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
NW Natural's gas acquisition and hedging policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies. These policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Financial derivative contracts are utilized to hedge a portion of natural gas sale requirements. These contracts include swaps, options, and combinations of option contracts. NW Natural primarily uses these derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price variability. A small portion of NW Natural's derivative hedging strategy involves foreign currency exchange contracts.
Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If certain regulatory conditions are met, then the derivative instrument fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to regulatory accounting, and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized in current income or loss. See "Regulatory Accounting" above for additional information. The gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from, or refund to, NGD business customers in future periods. If a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral, then the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses is recorded in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging which is either in current income or loss or in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI or AOCL). Derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data. Estimates of fair value may change significantly from period-to-period depending on market conditions, notional amounts, and prices. These changes may have an impact on results of operations, but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of derivative activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment. For more information on derivative activity and associated regulatory treatment, see Note 2 and Note 15.
The following table summarizes the amount of gains realized from commodity price transactions for the last three years:
Realized gains and losses from commodity hedges shown above were recorded in cost of gas and were, or will be, included in annual PGA rates.
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits
NW Natural maintains a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, non-qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees, and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering certain non-union employees. NW Natural also has a qualified defined contribution plan (Retirement K Savings Plan) for all eligible employees. Only the qualified defined benefit pension plan and Retirement K Savings Plan have plan assets, which are held in qualified trusts to fund the respective retirement benefits. The qualified defined benefit retirement plan for union and non-union employees was closed to new participants several years ago. Non-union and union employees hired or re-hired after December 31, 2006 and 2009, respectively, and employees of certain NW Holdings subsidiaries are provided an enhanced Retirement K Savings Plan benefit. The postretirement Welfare Benefit Plan for non-union employees was also closed to new participants several years ago.
Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs (retirement benefit costs) and projected benefit obligations (benefit obligations) are determined using a number of key assumptions including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement ages, mortality rates and an expected long-term return on plan assets. See Note 10.
Accounting standards also require balance sheet recognition of unamortized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in AOCI or AOCL, net of tax. However, the retirement benefit costs related to qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are generally recovered in rates charged to NGD customers, which are set based on accounting standards for pensions and postretirement benefit expenses. As such, NW Natural received approval from the OPUC to recognize the unamortized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability based on expected rate recovery, rather than including it as AOCI or AOCL under common equity. See "Regulatory Accounting" above and Note 2, "Industry Regulation".
A number of factors, as discussed above, are considered in developing pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. For the December 31, 2021 measurement date, NW Natural reviewed and updated:
•the weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions increased from 2.36% for 2020 to 2.71% for 2021, and our weighted-average discount rate assumptions for other postretirement benefits increased from 2.34% for 2020 to 2.72% for 2021. The new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of benchmark interest rates to the estimated cash flows, which reflect the timing and amount of future benefit payments. Benchmark interest rates are drawn from the FTSE Above Median Curve, which consists of high quality bonds rated AA- or higher by S&P or Aa3 or higher by Moody’s;
•the expected annual rate of future compensation for bargaining unit employees, which was updated from a range of 3.50% to 6.50% for 2020, was 3.50 % in 2021 and thereafter. The rate increase for non bargaining unit employees is 4.00% in 2022 and 3.50% thereafter.
•the expected long-term return on qualified defined benefit plan assets decreased from 7.25% in 2020 to 7.00% for 2021;
•Mortality assumptions are reviewed annually and are updated for material changes as necessary. In 2021, mortality rate assumptions were updated from Pri-2012 mortality tables using scale MP-2020 to Pri-2012 mortality tables using scale MP-2021, which partially offset increases of the projected benefit obligation; and
•other key assumptions, which were based on actual plan experience and actuarial recommendations.
At December 31, 2021, the net pension liability (benefit obligations less market value of plan assets) for the Pension Plan decreased $46.5 million compared to 2020. The decrease in the net pension liability is primarily due to the $25.3 million increase in plan assets and the $21.3 million decrease to the pension benefit obligation. The liability for non-qualified plans decreased $2.3 million, and the liability for other postretirement benefits decreased $1.8 million in 2021.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio. In developing expected return, historical actual performance and long-term return projections are analyzed, which gives consideration to the current asset mix and target asset allocation.
NW Natural believes its pension assumptions are appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions. The following shows the sensitivity of retirement benefit costs and benefit obligations to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:
Income Taxes
Valuation Allowances
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that these assets are believed to be more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. NW Holdings and NW Natural have determined that all recorded deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11.
Uncertain Tax Benefits
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A tax benefit from a material uncertain tax position will only be recognized when it is more likely
than not that the position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. NW Holdings and NW Natural participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under the CAP program companies work with the IRS to identify and resolve material tax matters before the federal income tax return is filed each year. No reserves for uncertain tax benefits were recorded during 2021, 2020, or 2019. See Note 11.
Tax Legislation
When significant proposed or enacted changes in income tax rules occur we consider whether there may be a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or whether the changes could materially affect existing assumptions used in making estimates of tax related balances.
The final tangible property regulations applicable to all taxpayers were issued on September 13, 2013 and were generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. In addition, procedural guidance related to the regulations was issued under which taxpayers may make accounting method changes to comply with the regulations. We have evaluated the regulations and do not anticipate any material impact. However, unit-of-property guidance applicable to natural gas distribution networks has not yet been issued and is expected in the near future. We will further evaluate the effect of these regulations after this guidance is issued, but believe the current method is materially consistent with the new regulations and do not expect this additional guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.
Regulatory Matters
Regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent it is probable they will be recoverable from, or refunded to, customers in the future. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NW Natural had net regulatory income tax assets of $12.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively, representing future rate recovery of deferred tax liabilities resulting from differences in NGD plant financial statement and tax bases and NGD plant removal costs. These regulatory assets are currently being recovered through customer rates. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, regulatory income tax assets of $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural, representing probable future rate recovery of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the equity portion of AFUDC. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, regulatory income tax assets of $0.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural, representing future recovery of Oregon Corporate Activity Tax that was deferred between January 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, regulatory liability balances, representing the estimated net benefit to NGD customers resulting from the change in deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA, of $189.6 million and $197.8 million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural. These balances include a gross up for income taxes of $50.2 million and $52.4 million, respectively.
The TCJA includes specific guidance for determining the shortest time period over which the portion of this regulatory liability resulting from accelerated cost recovery of NGD plant may accrue to the benefit of customers to avoid incurring federal normalization penalties. However, it is anticipated that until such time that customers receive the direct benefit of this regulatory liability, the balance, net of the additional gross up for income taxes, will continue to provide an indirect benefit to customers by reducing the NGD rate base which determines customer rates for service.
Environmental Contingencies
Environmental liabilities are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Amounts recorded for environmental contingencies take numerous factors into consideration, including, among other variables, changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders, estimated remediation costs, interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, timing of payments, and the input of legal counsel and third-party experts. Accordingly, changes in any of these variables or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental liabilities. For a complete discussion of environmental accounting policies refer to Note 2. For a discussion of current environmental sites and liabilities refer to Note 17. In addition, for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs and NW Natural's regulatory recovery mechanism, see "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery" above.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
Long-Lived Assets
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment of long-lived assets include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value or expected future cash flows of the asset, among others.
When such factors are present, we assess the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered through expected future cash flows. An asset is determined to be impaired when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated using appropriate valuation methodologies, which may include an estimate of discounted cash flows.
Goodwill and Business Combinations
In a business combination, goodwill is initially measured as any excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the acquisition-date fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter using balances as of October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable.
NW Holdings' policy for goodwill assessments begins with a qualitative analysis in which events and circumstances are evaluated, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, regulatory environments, and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that the carrying value may be at risk of recoverability, a quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the carrying value against the fair value of the reporting unit. This evaluation may involve the assessment of future cash flows and other subjective factors for which uncertainty exists and could impact the estimation of future cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, future growth rates, and the discount rate. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affect these estimates, which could result in an impairment charge. A qualitative assessment was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 which indicated a quantitative assessment was not required; thus, no goodwill impairment was recorded. See Note 2 and Note 14 for additional information.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. When NW Natural acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. When there is substantial judgment or uncertainty around the fair value of acquired assets, we may engage a third party expert to assist in determining the fair values of certain assets or liabilities.
