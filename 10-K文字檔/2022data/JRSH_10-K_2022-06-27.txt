Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Overview
Through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, we are principally engaged in the manufacturing and exporting of customized, ready-made sportswear and outerwear from knitted fabric and PPE produced in our facilities in Jordan.
We are an approved manufacturer of many well-known brands and retailers, such as Walmart, Costco, New Balance, G-III (which owns brands such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY, and Guess), American Eagle, VF Corporation (which operates brands such as The North Face, Timberland, and Vans). Our production facilities are made up of six factories and four warehouses and currently employ approximately 5,700 people. The total annual capacity at our facilities is approximately 14.0 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polo shirts, pants, shorts, and jackets, and excluding PPE).
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
Collectability of receivables. We had accounts receivable of $11.0 million as of March 31, 2022, out of which $10.4 million had been received through June 23, 2022. Two major customers have offered early payment alternatives since May and July 2021, which have shortened payment terms to below 10 days from submission of documents. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more details.
Inventory. We had inventory of $28.3 million as of March 31, 2022, substantially for orders scheduled to be shipped within fiscal 2023.
Investments. We acquired two pieces of land in fiscal 2020 for the construction of dormitory and production facilities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, management previously decided to hold off the construction to wait for a clearer picture on customer demand. As customer orders recovered to a satisfactory level, in April 2021, management decided to begin work for the dormitory construction, which is expected to be completed and ready for use in fiscal 2023. In June and July 2021, we entered into two Sale and Purchase Contracts to acquire a garment factory and the physical land and building that the factory was leasing. The acquisition of the garment factory was completed on October 7, 2021. We accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting. The operating results of this garment factory since the completion of the acquisition and the assets of this garment factory are included in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 included in elsewhere in this annual report. The acquisition of the land and building of the factory is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to personal reasons of the seller in relation to health and quarantine requirements. See “Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies-Commitments.”
Revenue. For fiscal 2022, our sales were $143.4 million, which represented an approximate 58.9% increase from $90.2 million for fiscal 2021. We have been proactively communicating with our existing customers to reconfirm their orders and shipment schedules for fiscal 2023. However, our operating results are still subject to the economies in the U.S. and the EU that would have significant impact on both order fulfilment and delivery schedules and our operating results may be adversely affected by the negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions, inflation, and a potential recession.
Liquidity/Going Concern. As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately $25.2 million of cash and net current assets of approximately $69.9 million with a current ratio of 4.9 to 1. In addition, we had banking facilities with aggregate limits of $3 million with $nil outstanding as of March 31, 2022. Given the above, we believe that we will have sufficient financial resources to maintain as a going concern in fiscal 2023. On October 4, 2021, we completed the placement of one million new shares to independent investors with a net proceed of approximately $6.3 million to further bolster our financial position for further growth.
Capital Expenditures. In fiscal 2021, management decided to put on hold the construction projects on the land acquired in fiscal 2020 to retain financial resources to support our operations, and also to wait and see how the global economy and customer demand recover after the COVID-19 pandemic. As customer orders recovered to a satisfactory level, management decided to restart the preparation work for the construction of the dormitory in April 2021. The dormitory is expected to be completed and ready for use in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, the Company acquired five car parking spaces.
Seasonality of Sales
A significant portion of our revenue is received during the first six months of our fiscal year. The majority of our VF Corporation orders are derived from winter season fashions, the sales of which occur in Spring and Summer and are merchandized by VF Corporation during the months of September through November. As such, the second half of our fiscal years reflect lower sales in anticipation of the spring and summer seasons. One of our strategies is to increase sales with other customers where clothing lines are stronger during the spring months. This strategy also reflects our current plan to increase our number of customers to mitigate our current concentration risk with VF Corporation.
Results of Operations
The following table presents certain information from our statement of income for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and should be read, along with all of the information in this management’s discussion and analysis, in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing.
(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)
Revenue. Revenue increased by approximately $53.1 million, or 59%, to approximately $143.4 million in fiscal 2022 from approximately $90.2 million in fiscal 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in export sales to two of our major U.S. customers. Strong recovery in the U.S. markets along with our continued expansion of the cooperation with these two major customers generated substantial order increases. All factories, including MK Garments and Paramount (acquired in mid-2019), are fully booked until December 2022 and were operating at or near capacity during fiscal 2022.
The following table outlines the dollar amount and percentage of total sales to our customers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)
(1) A large portion of our products are sold under The North Face brand that is owned by VF Corporation.
Revenue by Geographic Area
(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)
Since January 2010, all apparel manufactured in Jordan can be exported to the U.S. without customs duty being imposed, pursuant to the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement entered into in December 2001. This free trade agreement provides us with substantial competitiveness and benefit that allowed us to expand our garment export business in the U.S.
The increase of approximately 72% in sales to the U.S. during fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was mainly attributable to the increase in the export sales to two of our major customers in the U.S.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, aggregate sales to Jordan and other locations, such as Hong Kong and China, decreased by 34% from approximately $11.0 million to $7.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 as more production capacity was allocated to export orders, which typically have a higher profit margin.
Cost of goods sold. Following the increase in sales revenue, our cost of goods sold increased by approximately $41.8 million, or 56%, to approximately $116.0 million in fiscal 2022 from approximately $74.2 million in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of revenue, the cost of goods sold decreased by approximately 1% points to 81% in fiscal 2022 from 82% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a full resumption of production and a higher proportion of export orders in fiscal 2022.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we purchased approximately 20% and 11% of our garments and raw materials from two major suppliers, respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we purchased approximately 13% of our garments from one major supplier.
Gross profit margin. Gross profit margin was approximately 19% in fiscal 2022, which increased by approximately 1% points from 18% in fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily driven by higher proportion of export orders that typically have higher margin.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by approximately 59% from approximately $10.6 million in fiscal 2021 to approximately $16.8 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) increased costs for employing additional migrant workers, (ii) the inclusion of approximately $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses, (iii) an increase in headcounts from the completion of acquisition of MK Garment in October 2021, and (iv) an increase in export expenses in proportion to growth in sales in fiscal 2022.
Other (expenses)/ income, net. Other expenses, net were approximately $45,000 in fiscal 2022 and other income, net was approximately $109,000 in fiscal 2021. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to the absence of a realized gain from short-term investments in the current period, compare with a $124,889 realized gain from short-term investments in the corresponding period of fiscal 2021.
Taxation. Income tax expenses for the fiscal 2022 were approximately $2.5 million compared to income tax expenses of approximately $1.3 million for fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate was slightly down to 24.2% for fiscal 2022, compared to 24.5% for the fiscal 2021 as Treasure Success started to report profit and the tax rate in Hong Kong is 16.5%, which is lower than 18% to 20% of Jordan.
Net income. Net income for fiscal 2022 was approximately $7.9 million, a 91% increase from approximately $4.1 million for fiscal 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in sales and the improvement in the gross profit margin discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Jerash Holdings is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. As a holding company, we rely on dividends and other distributions from our Jordanian and Hong Kong subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Current Jordanian regulations permit our Jordanian subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Jordanian accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our Jordanian subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. We have relied on direct payments of expenses by our subsidiaries (which generate revenue) to meet our obligations to date. To the extent payments are due in U.S. dollars, we have occasionally paid such amounts in JOD to an entity controlled by our management capable of paying such amounts in U.S. dollars. Such transactions have been made at prevailing exchange rates and have resulted in immaterial losses or gains on currency exchange but no other profit.
As of March 31, 2022, we had cash of approximately $25.2 million and restricted cash of approximately $1.4 million compared to cash of approximately $21.1 million and restricted cash of approximately $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021. The increase in total cash was mainly a result of (i) the completion of a placement in October 2021 that resulted in net proceeds of approximately $6.3 million, and (ii) the introduction of supply chain finance programs by two of our major customers that reduce payment terms from 60 to 90 days to within 10 days from shipments, offsetting approximately $8.7 million used for the MK Garments acquisition, purchases of property, plant, and machinery, and payments for dormitory construction.
Our current assets as of March 31, 2022 were approximately $69.9 million, and our current liabilities were approximately $14.1 million, which resulted in a current ratio of approximately 4.9:1. Our current assets as of March 31, 2021 were approximately $64.7 million, and our current liabilities were approximately $14.8 million, which resulted in a current ratio of approximately 4.4:1. The primary drivers in the increase in current assets were the increase in cash as a result of a share placement completed in October 2021 and the increase in operating profit in the year. The primary driver in the decrease in current liabilities was the decrease in accounts payable due to the earlier payments to newly appointed suppliers, particularly for new customers introduced in recent years, and the repayment of short-term bank loans in light of the strong cash position. Total equity as of March 31, 2022 was approximately $69.3 million, compared to $56.4 million as of March 31, 2021.
We had net working capital of $55.7 million and $49.8 million as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operation will be sufficient to support our working capital needs for the next 12 months from the date of this Annually Report.
Since May and October 2021, we have participated in supply chain financing programs of two of our major customers, respectively. The programs allow us to receive early payments for approved sales invoices submitted by us through the bank the customer cooperates with. For any early payments received, we are subject to an early payment charge imposed by the customer’s bank, for which the rate is London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The arrangement allows us to have better liquidity without the need to incur administrative charges and handling fees as in bank financing.
We have funded our working capital needs from operations. Our working capital requirements are influenced by the level of our operations, the numerical and dollar volume of our sales contracts, the progress of execution on our customer contracts, and the timing of accounts receivable collections.
Credit Facilities
SCBHK Facility Letter
Pursuant to the SCBHK facility letter dated June 15, 2018, and issued to Treasure Success by SCBHK, SCBHK offered to provide an import facility of up to $3.0 million to Treasure Success. The SCBHK facility covers import invoice financing and pre-shipment financing under export orders with a combined limit of $3 million. Borrowings under the SCBHK facility are due within 90 days of each invoice or financing date. SCBHK charges interest at 1.3% per annum over SCBHK’s cost of funds. In consideration for arranging the SCBHK facility, Treasure Success paid SCBHK HKD50,000. We were informed by SCBHK on January 31, 2019 that the SCBHK facility had been activated. As of March 31, 2022, there was no amount outstanding under the SCBHK facility. In June 2022, we were informed by SCBHK that the facility was cancelled due to persistently low usage and zero loan outstanding.
DBS Facility Letter
Pursuant to the DBS facility letter dated January 12, 2022, DBSHK provided a bank facility of up to $5.0 million to Treasure Success. Pursuant to the agreement, DBSHK agreed to finance cargo receipt, trust receipt, account payable financing, and certain type of import invoice financing up to an aggregate of $5.0 million. The DBSHK facility bears interest at 1.5% per annum over Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (“HIBOR”) for HKD bills and 1.3% per annum over DBSHK’s cost of funds for foreign currency bills. The facility is guaranteed by Jerash Holdings and became available to the Company on June 17, 2022.
Fiscal Years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
(All amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2022, compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the following factors:
● an increase in inventory of $3.2 million during fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $2.4 million during fiscal 2021;
● a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.8 million during fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $6.7 million in fiscal 2021;
● an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.9 million, compared to a decrease of $0.4 million in fiscal 2021;
● a decrease in advance to suppliers of $1.7 million, compared to an increase of $0.9 million in fiscal 2021;
● a decrease in accounts payable of $3.1 million during fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $1.5 million in fiscal 2021; and
● an increase of net income to $7.9 million during fiscal 2022 from a net income of $4.1 million in fiscal 2021.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $8.7 million and $0.9 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributable to $3.0 million used in the acquisition of property, plant and machinery, $2.1 million for payments for the construction of a dormitory, and $2.7 million for the acquisition of all the share capital of MK Garments.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $3.3 million for fiscal 2022, from the net proceeds of $6.3 million in a placement completed in October 2021 and outflows of dividend payments of approximately $2.4 million and repayments of short-term loans of approximately $0.6 million. There was a net cash outflow of $1.7 million in fiscal 2021 resulting from dividend payments and proceeds from short-term loans.
Statutory Reserves
In accordance with the corporate Law in Jordan, Jerash Holdings’ subsidiaries in Jordan are required to make appropriations to certain reserve funds, based on net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of Jordan. Appropriations to the statutory reserve are required to be 10% of net income until the reserve is equal to 100% of the entity’s share capital. Jiangmen Treasure Success is required to set aside 10% of its net income as statutory surplus reserve until such reserve is equal to 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not available for dividend distribution. The statutory reserve was $379,323 and $346,315 as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The following table provides the amount of our statutory reserves, the amount of restricted net assets, consolidated net assets, and the amount of restricted net assets as a percentage of consolidated net assets, as of March 31, 2022 and 2021.
(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)
Total restricted net assets accounted for approximately 0.55% of our consolidated net assets as of March 31, 2022. As our subsidiaries in Jordan are only required to set aside 10% of net profits to fund the statutory reserves, we believe the potential impact of such restricted net assets on our liquidity is limited.
Capital Expenditures
We had capital expenditures of approximately $8.7 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, for property, plant, and machinery, the construction of a dormitory, and the acquisition of MK Garment. Additions in property, plant, and machinery amounted to approximately $3.0 million and $0.8 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Payments for construction of a dormitory and factory expansion amounted to $2.1 million in fiscal 2022, and payment made for the acquisition of all the share capital of MK Garment was $2.7 million in fiscal 2022.
In 2015, we commenced a project to build a 4,800 square-foot workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which was initially intended to be used as a sewing workshop for Jerash Garments, but which we now use as a dormitory to house management and supervisory staff for the 54,000 square-foot workshop in Al-Hasa County. Construction was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but subsequently completed, and the building was ready for use as of September 30, 2021.
In 2018, we commenced another project to build a 54,000 square-foot factory in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which started operation in November 2019 with approximately 240 workers. This project was constructed in conjunction with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Jordanian Education and Training Department.
On August 7, 2019, we completed a transaction to acquire 12,340 square meters (approximately three acres) of land in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from a third party to construct a dormitory for our employees with aggregate purchase price JOD863,800 (approximately $1,218,303). Management has revised the plan to construct both dormitory and production facilities on the land in order to capture the increasing demand for our capacity. We are conducting engineering design and study on this project and we plan to begin construction in early 2022. On February 6, 2020, we completed a transaction to acquire 4,516 square meters (approximately 48,608 square feet) of land in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from a third party to construct a dormitory for our employee with aggregate purchase price JOD313,501 (approximately $442,162). We expect to spend approximately $8.2 million in capital expenditures to build the dormitory. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, management decided to put on hold the construction project in fiscal 2021 to retain financial resources to support our operations, and also to wait and see how the global economy and customer demand recover after the outbreak. The preparation work resumed in early 2021 and construction work commenced in April 2021. The dormitory is expected to be completed and ready for use in fiscal 2023.
We project that there will be an aggregate of approximately $16 million and $0.5 million of capital expenditures in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, for further enhancement of production capacity to meet future sales growth. We expect that our capital expenditures will increase in the future as our business continues to develop and expand. We have used cash generated from operations of our subsidiaries to fund our capital commitments in the past and anticipate using such funds to fund capital expenditure commitments in the future.
Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements
We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as stockholders’ equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
For Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on June 23, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America, which require us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect our reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and any related disclosures. Although there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates and assumptions in the past two years, we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates.
We believe that certain accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates. The policies that we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are summarized in “Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our audited financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See “Note 3-Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in the notes to our audited financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
