Completion of Merger
On September 18, 2021, LINKBANCORP, Inc. ("LINKBANCORP" or the "Company"), completed its merger with GNB Financial Services, Inc. (the “Merger”), with LINKBANCORP as the surviving corporation. Immediately following the Merger, LINKBANK, a wholly-owned subsidiary of LINKBANCORP, merged with and into The Gratz Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GNBF, with The Gratz Bank as the surviving bank. LINKBANK's banking offices will continue to operate as LINKBANK, a division of The Gratz Bank.
Under the Merger Agreement, GNBF shareholders had the opportunity to elect to receive $87.68 per share in cash or 7.3064 of LINKBANCORP common shares for each share they owned. The Merger Agreement provided for proration procedures intended to ensure that, in the aggregate, at least 80% of the GNBF common shares outstanding would be exchanged for LINKBANCORP common stock. The Merger was effective on September 18, 2021, with the GNBF shareholders collectively electing to receive cash for 14.865% of their common shares and LINKBANCORP common shares for 85.135% of existing GNBF common shares. These elections resulted in LINKBANCORP issuing 4.85 million common shares to GNBF shareholders which represented approximately 49.4% of the post-merger outstanding common shares of LINKBANCORP.
As described in Note 2. "Merger," the Merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and, accordingly, the historical financial information of the Company for all periods prior to the Merger Date is that of GNBF and Subsidiaries. For all periods beginning on September 18, 2021 and thereafter, the financial information is that of the combined company. See Note 2. “Merger” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Overview and Strategy
The Company’s core strategy is to further its mission of “positively impacting lives” through community banking by building strong relationships that bring value to its customers, employees, the communities it serves and its shareholders. In pursuing this mission, the Company specifically desires to invest in the development of strong future leaders for the banking industry and our communities, to contribute to economically and socially flourishing communities, and to demonstrate the continued viability and integral role of community banking for our economic and social development.
The Company operates primarily through its sole subsidiary, The Gratz Bank and LINKBANK, a division of The Gratz Bank (collectively, the "Bank"), which provides traditional lending, deposit gathering and cash services to retail customers, small businesses and nonprofit organizations. The Bank focuses its lending activities on small businesses, targeted to create a diverse loan portfolio in relation to its underlying collateral and different business segments with unique cash flow generation and varied interest rate sensitivity. The Bank offers a full suite of deposit products and cash management services focused on the small business and nonprofit segments.
Our revenues consist primarily of interest income earned on loans and investments. Interest income is partially offset by interest expense incurred on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their relative interest rates. Net interest income is typically further reduced by a provision for loan losses.
Non-interest income also contributes to our operating results, consisting of service charges on deposit accounts, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, revenue from the sale of residential mortgage loans to the secondary market and related servicing fees and gains on sales of securities. Non-interest expenses, which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional fees, FDIC insurance and other general and administrative expenses, are the Company’s primary expenditures incurred as a result of operations.
Financial institutions, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are concentrated in South Central Pennsylvania in Dauphin, Chester, Cumberland, Lancaster, Northumberland, and Schuylkill Counties, and are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.
Recent Market Conditions
The Company’s financial condition and performance are all highly dependent on the business environment in the market area in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. During the first quarter of 2020, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) which spread to numerous countries around the world, including the United States, while becoming a global pandemic. As the spread of COVID-19 increased during the first and second quarters of 2020, federal, state, and local governments implemented various restrictive measures such as quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, “stay at home” rules and restrictions on certain business operations. These restrictions have slowly been lifted as people had begun to gain access to vaccines during the fourth quarter of 2020. Throughout the first half of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively affect our economy but started to wane towards the end of the second quarter only to see a national resurgence in cases during July 2021 and December 2021 as a result of variant strains of COVID-19. Primarily throughout 2020, the aforementioned restrictions had adversely affected the economy on a national, state, and local level, including the geographical areas in which the Company operates. As we progressed through 2021, especially during the second half of 2021, our economy benefited from reduced business and travel restrictions as the national and local impact of COVID-19 lessened.
Overall, real GDP decreased by 3.5% for 2020 as compared to an increase of 2.2% in 2019. As a result of the global pandemic, market interest rates have declined significantly during 2020 with the 10-year Treasury bond falling from a high yield of 1.88% on January 2, 2020 to a low of 0.52% on August 4, 2020. However, during 2021 the economic recovery from the global pandemic resulted in real GDP growth of 5.7% when compared to 2020. With the economy experiencing its strongest full year growth since 1984, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is now at the forefront of economic discussions as debate arises around what actions, if any, the Federal Reserve will take to attempt to slow the economic growth and the inflation that comes with it. According to the February Consumer Price Index, consumer prices increased 7.9% from a year earlier, the fastest yearly increase in over 40 years. Surging commodity prices and disruptions emanating from the war in Ukraine is influencing investor sentiment and increased expectations for inflation and future additional Federal Reserve rate hikes.
At the beginning of 2020 the Federal Reserve had set the target range for the Fed Funds rate at 1.50% to 1.75% and by March 31, 2020, the Fed Funds target range had been reduced to 0% to 0.25%. The Fed Funds rate has been left unchanged through the remainder of 2020 and through December 31, 2021. While the consensus is that rates will be increased multiple times during 2022, the current geopolitical environment in Europe provides yet another layer of uncertainty around the actions that the Federal Reserve might take. It is reasonably foreseeable that estimates made in the financial statements could be materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including expected credit losses on loans.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Total assets at December 31, 2021, were $932.8 million, an increase of $503.3 million, or 117%, from $429.5 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in total assets was primarily due to the assets acquired in the Merger, which totaled $523.2 million and consisted of:
Excluding the assets acquired through the Merger, assets at December 31, 2021 would have decreased $20.0 million from December 31, 2020.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $10.6 million, or 32%, from $33.2 million at December 31, 2020 to $22.6 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to:
Primary Cash Inflows
•Cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 million;
•Net cash acquired through the Merger of $39.9 million;
•Net increase in deposits of $5.4 million;
•Net cash from investment securities (sales, calls, maturities, and principal repayments less purchases) of $21.7 million; and
•Net proceeds from redemption of certificates of deposits with other banks of $4.2 million
Primary Cash Outflows
•Repayments of borrowings of $14.3 million;
•Net increase in loans receivable of $66.5 million;
•Payment of dividends of $1.5 million; and
•Purchase of bank-owned life insurance of $5.0 million
Securities available-for-sale decreased by $21.6 million, or 17%, to $103.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $125.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of $11.3 million of securities available-for-sale, a decrease in fair value of our holdings of $1.6 million and net amortization of premiums and discounts of $1.4 million. Additionally during 2021, the Company purchased $14.2 million of securities and received a return of principal of $24.5 million. The proceeds from securities sales and the net return of principal repayments were used to fund loan growth during 2021.
The following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of securities available for sale as of December 31, 2021. Weighted average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21%. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their contractual maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
Net loans receivable increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as shown in the table below:
The majority of the growth in net loans was a result of the loans acquired through the Merger which totaled $415.9 million. Following the merger, during the fourth quarter of 2021, total loans grew by $46.4 million, primarily in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which equates to an approximate annualized growth rate of 27% for the quarter.
The following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. The table further presents breakdown of our loans between those loans that earn interest at a fixed interest rate and those loans that contain an interest rate that currently fluctuates in accordance with changes to a specific interest rate index.
Non-accrual loans are presented in the table below. Also see Note 6 - Allowance for Loan Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
The table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The allowance for loan losses increased $363 thousand from $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $3.2 million at December 31, 2021. The primary driver of the increased allowance for loan losses was a provision for loan losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $648 thousand, offset by net chargeoffs of $285 thousand. During the year ended December 31, 2021, management noted that a total of 8 pre-merger loans with an outstanding principal balance of $560 thousand had migrated from the Pass risk rating category to the Substandard category and an additional 8 pre-merger loans with an outstanding principal balance of $4.3 million had migrated from the Pass risk rating category to the Special Mention category resulting in a need to increase the provision for loan losses. Additionally, management adjusted the qualitative allowance factors to reflect a change in management over
the credit portfolio, also adding to the current year provision when compared to the prior year. Not included in the table above is the remaining unamortized credit fair value adjustment on loans acquired through the Merger which totaled $7.1 million at December 31, 2021.
Asset quality remained strong at December 31, 2021 with non-performing assets, which is defined as non-accrual loans, loans delinquent greater than 90 days and still accruing interest, and other real estate owned, was $1.8 million or 0.25% of total gross loans. This is compared to $616 thousand of non-performing assets at December 31, 2020, which equated to 0.26% of gross loans. Additionally, to compare our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of our gross loans outstanding, the Company also considers the credit fair value adjustment that was made to the loans acquired through the Merger, which totaled $7.1 million at December 31, 2021, in order to capture a truer picture of our overall coverage related to potential loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses and our credit fair value adjustment total $10.2 million at December 31, 2021 and represented 1.41% to our total gross loans, which is an increase from 1.18% at December 31, 2020.
Additional information related to the provision for loan losses and net (charge-offs) recoveries is presented in the table below. Also see Note 6 - Allowance for Loan Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Total deposits grew by $396.5 million or 106%, from $375.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $771.7 million at December 31, 2021. Changes in the deposit types are presented in the table below:
Of the increase in total deposits of $396.5 million, the deposits assumed in the Merger contributed $391.2 million resulting in deposit growth outside of the Merger of $5.4 million or 1% from December 31, 2020.
The table below presents the daily average balances by deposit type and weighted average rates paid thereon for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The Company has deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 of $317.2 million at December 31, 2021. Total uninsured deposits is calculated based on regulatory reporting requirements and reflects the portion of any deposit of a customer at an insured depository institution that exceeds the applicable FDIC insurance coverage for that depositor at that institution and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regime. At December 31, 2021, the scheduled maturities of time deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit or otherwise uninsured were as follows:
At December 31, 2021, other borrowings consisted of $19.8 million in borrowings under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”), which were assumed as part of the Merger. The PPPLF is a program designated to facilitate lending by financial institutions to small businesses under the PPP provision of the CARES Act. At December 31, 2020, other borrowings consisted of $1.1 million in FHLB fixed rate advances. Additionally, subordinated debt with a fair value of $20.7 million was assumed as part of the Merger. These notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.0% per year for five years and then float at an index tied to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate ("SOFR"). The notes have a term of ten years, with a maturity date of October 1, 2030. The notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, subject to any required regulatory approvals after five years.
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $58.9 million, or 116%, from $50.7 million at December 31, 2020, to $109.6 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the stock issued in association with the Merger which added $61.4 million to shareholders' equity and net income of $289 thousand. This addition to equity was partially offset by dividends paid of $1.5 million and other comprehensive loss of $1.4 million.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General: Net income was $289 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, or $0.04 per diluted share, a decrease of $3.9 million compared to net income of $4.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected the results of GNBF for the period from January 1, 2021 through September 17, 2021 and the results of the combined company following the completion of the Merger on September 18, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year was the result of an increase in noninterest expense of $9.2 million, $4.6 million of which related to Merger expenses, and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $464 thousand. These were partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income of $4.2 million, a decrease in interest expense of $327 thousand, a decrease in income tax expense of $834 thousand, and an increase in noninterest income of $385 thousand.
Analysis of Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents the difference between the interest the Company earns on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates the Company earns or pays on them.
Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields: The following table sets forth certain information relating to average balance sheets and reflects the average annualized yield on interest-earning assets and average annualized cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields, but were not material adjustments to the yields. Yields on earning assets are shown on a fully taxable-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of 21%.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table reflects the sensitivity of the Company’s interest income and interest expense to changes in volume and in yields on interest-earning assets and costs of interest-bearing liabilities during the periods indicated.
Net Interest Income: Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by $4.5 million, or 39%, to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase can be mostly attributed to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher average balance in loans, as well as a decrease in interest expense resulting from decreased rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.07% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.97% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Income: Interest income increased to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans as a result of the growth in average assets, primarily loans, following the completion of the Merger. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets which increased $134.0 million to $523.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $389.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 contributed $5.9 million in growth of interest income. The average balance of loans increased $137.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the Merger. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in average yield on interest earning assets which decreased 16 basis points from 3.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 3.59% for the year ended December 31, 2021. In general, the Company experienced a decrease in most rates on interest earning assets as a result of the low interest rate environment which began following the Federal Reserve's decision to decrease the range for the Fed Funds target rate to 0% to 0.25% as of March 31, 2020. This rate reduction along with increased competition for loan originations has resulted in new loans originated during 2021, generally, earning a lower percentage of interest compared to the loan portfolio existing at December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased by $327 thousand or 12.0% to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the decrease in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, which decreased 33 basis points from 0.91% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 0.58% for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the reduction in rates of our time deposits and interest bearing demand deposits. This decrease in rates was partially offset by an increase in the average balances of interest bearing liabilities, which increased $115.4 million to $413.5 million for the year ended December 31 2021 compared to $298.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the increase in the average balance of our deposits. While the aforementioned lower rate environment has helped the Company reduce overall cost of funds, the evolution of our business has also played a role in this reduction of cost. As the Company continues to grow and mature, we have been able to continue to foster customer relationships that grow core deposits and decrease its reliance upon higher cost time deposits.
Provision for Loan Losses: The provision for loan losses increased by $464 thousand from $184 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $648 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, management noted that a total of 8 pre-merger loans with an outstanding principal balance of $560 thousand had migrated from the Pass risk rating category to the Substandard category and an additional 8 pre-merger loans with an outstanding principal balance of $4.3 million had migrated from the Pass risk rating category to the Special Mention category resulting in a need to increase the provision for loan losses. Another cause for additional provision for loan losses can be attributed to an increase in net charge-offs of $188 thousand
during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Additionally, management adjusted the qualitative allowance factors to reflect a change in management over the credit portfolio, also adding to the current year provision when compared to the prior year.
The Company completes a comprehensive quarterly evaluation to determine its provision for loan losses. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience, and changes in net loan balances, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the provision for loan losses.
Non-interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $385 thousand to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from the $1.8 million recognized during 2020. The increase was the result of increased earnings on bank owned life insurance due to additional purchases and assumptions from the Merger. The Merger also resulted in various other increases in other fees and charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.
Non-interest Expenses: Non-interest expenses increased $9.2 million or 111%, from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was largely due to Merger related expenses which totaled $4.6 million and represent one-time expenses that have been specifically incurred as a result of the Merger and management would not expect to incur these expenses in future periods where a merger is not present. Additionally, the Company noted (1) an increase of $2.5 million in salary and employee benefits expense related to increased employee headcount post-merger; (2) an increase of $466 thousand in occupancy expense as a result of increased lease expense and increased depreciation expense related to the addition of historic LINKBANK locations as a result of the reverse merger; (3) an increase of $152 thousand in equipment and data processing expenses related to the additional costs attributed to maintaining two operating systems until our system conversion was completed on October 15, 2021; and (4) an increase in FDIC insurance costs of $158 thousand.
Income Tax Benefit/Expense: Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $189 thousand compared to income tax expense of $645 thousand for the same period in 2020. Accounting for the effect of tax free income and non-deductible merger expenses resulted in a net tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity, Commitments, and Capital Resources
The Company’s liquidity, represented by cash and due from banks, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. The Company’s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal repayments of securities and outstanding loans, and funds provided from operations. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earnings assets such as overnight deposits or U.S. agency securities, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.
The Company strives to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund operations, loan demand and to satisfy fluctuations in deposit levels. The Company is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound banking operations. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Our attempts to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity, and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of the Company’s business management. We manages our liquidity in accordance with a board of directors-approved asset liability policy, which is administered by the Company’s asset-liability committee (“ALCO”). ALCO reports interest rate sensitivity, liquidity, capital and investment-related matters on a quarterly basis to the Company’s board of directors.
The Company reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2021 totaled $118.6 million, or 66% of our certificates of deposit, and 15% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and FHLB advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. While deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds, when needed the Company is also able to generate cash through borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”). At December 31, 2021, the Company had remaining available capacity with FHLB, subject to certain collateral restrictions, of approximately $284.6 million. There were no advances outstanding at December 31, 2021.
Consistent with the Company’s goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial institution, the Company actively seeks to maintain the Bank's status as a well-capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
Bank met the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized.” See Note 17 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our capital resources.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
See Note 18 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning for more information regarding the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements.
For disclosures of the Company’s future obligations under operating leases, please see Note 8 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For disclosures of the Company’s contractual obligations related to certificates of deposits, please see Note 10 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
It is management’s opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the Company’s business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimates. Management has determined that our critical accounting policies are those policies governing the computation of the allowance for loan losses and our policy related to accounting for business combinations. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all our accounting policies, including these identified critical accounting policies.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Recently issued accounting standards are included in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
