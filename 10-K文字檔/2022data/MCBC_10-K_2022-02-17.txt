RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Summary: Net income was $29.0 million ($35.7 million on a pretax basis) for 2021, compared to $30.2 million ($36.8 million on a pretax basis) for 2020. Earnings per common share on a diluted basis were $0.85 for 2021 and $0.88 for 2020.
Over the past several years, the improvement in our earnings has been the result of growth in revenue while expenses have been stable. The pandemic and related economic programs impacted this dynamic. We recognized a significant amount of fee income from PPP loans in 2021 and 2020, while net interest income was negatively impacted by a very low interest rate environment and our customers holding historically high deposit balances at the Bank. The decrease in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to a reduction in net interest income and a lower level of gains on sales of mortgage loans. Our operating expenses were relatively flat from 2020 to 2021. Net interest income decreased to $56.1 million in 2021 compared to $61.5 million in 2020. Gains on sales of mortgage loans were $4.7 million in 2021 compared to $6.5 million in 2020. Other categories of noninterest income were up $1.5 million in 2021, mostly offsetting the impact of lower gains on mortgage sales. Total noninterest expense was $46.1 million in 2021 compared to $45.7 million in 2020.
We recorded a provision for loan losses benefit of $2.1 million in 2021 and a provision for loan losses expense of $3.0 million in 2020. The provision taken in 2020 was driven by a $4.1 million charge-off taken in the second quarter of 2020 related to a single loan relationship with a movie theater business where the underlying assets were sold through bankruptcy proceedings. The 2020 provision also included additional allocations provided to the portfolio for qualitative factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provisions, particularly in 2021, were favorably impacted by low levels of nonperforming loans, strong asset quality and the levels of net loan charge-offs to recoveries realized in recent periods. These items are discussed more fully below.
Net Interest Income: Net interest income totaled $56.1 million during 2021 compared to $61.5 million during 2020.
The decrease in net interest income during 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to a reduction in yields on earning assets, particularly overnight deposits as the federal funds rate was decreased by 150 basis points in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and maintained at near zero levels throughout 2021. Average yields on securities, interest earning assets and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Our net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets (i.e. "net interest margin" or "margin") was 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The yield on earning assets decreased 81 basis points from 3.00% for 2020 to 2.19% for 2021. The decrease from 2020 to 2021 was generally due to an increase of $644.6 million in average federal funds sold while the average short-term interest rates earned on these deposits remained near zero throughout 2021. Our margin in recent years has been negatively impacted by our decision to hold significant balances in liquid and short-term investments.
Net interest income for 2021 decreased $5.5 million compared to 2020. Of this decrease, $6.7 million was due to changes in the volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million from changes in rates earned or paid. The largest changes came in commercial loan interest income which decreased by $5.1 million in 2021. Of the $5.1 million decrease in interest income on commercial loans, $6.8 million was due to decreases in average balances, driven by forgiveness of PPP loans, partially offset by $1.7 million due to increases in rates earned from accelerated amortization of PPP fees upon forgiveness.
Average interest earning assets totaled $2.70 billion for 2021 compared to $2.25 billion in 2020. Increases of $644.6 million in average short-term investment balances partially offset by $240.5 million in decreases in average loan balances from 2020 to 2021 were the primary drivers of the increase in total average interest earning assets. Yield on commercial loans (excluding PPP loans) decreased from 4.01% in 2020 to 3.72% in 2021. Yield on PPP loans was 5.79% in 2021 and 3.32% in 2020. The yield on PPP loans for 2021 was elevated as remaining deferred fees are recognized upon forgiveness. Yield on residential mortgage loans decreased from 3.66% in 2020 to 3.41% in 2021, while yield on consumer loans decreased from 4.32% in 2020 to 4.05% in 2021. The decreases in yields on commercial loans and consumer loans, in particular, were the result of the predominance of loans in these categories with variable rates of interest tied to prime and LIBOR which decreased significantly in 2020 and remained low throughout 2021.
- 24 -
Our net interest margin for 2021 was positively impacted from a 23 basis point decrease in our cost of funds from 0.38% for 2020 to 0.15% for 2021. Average interest bearing liabilities increased from $1.47 billion in 2020 to $1.69 billion in 2021. Decreases in the rates paid on certain deposit account types in response to market rate declines were the primary cause of the decrease in our cost of funds. Also impacting cost of funds for 2021 was the redemption of the remaining $20.0 million trust preferred securities on July 7, 2021. While our funding costs have decreased, the yields on our interest earning assets decreased to a larger extent, causing net interest income and net interest margin to decrease from 2020 to 2021.
In 2022, we expect that net interest margin will continue to be pressured by our higher levels of short-term investment balances. However, potentially offsetting this dynamic is the asset-sensitive profile of our balance sheet which should cause improvement in net interest income should market interest rates rise.
The following table shows an analysis of net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).

Yields are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a 21% tax rate.
(2)
Loan fees of $1.1 million and $852,000 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in interest income. Includes average nonaccrual loans of approximately $431,000 and $2.2 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excludes PPP loans.
(3)
Includes loan fees of $8.3 million and $5.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in net interest income due to changes in volume and rate.
Provision for Loan Losses: The provision for loan losses for 2021 was a benefit of $2.1 million compared to expense of $3.0 million for 2020. The provision for loan losses for 2020 was impacted by additional qualitative adjustments made to provide for estimated losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a $4.1 million charge-off taken in June 2020 related to a single loan relationship with a movie theater business for which the underlying assets were sold through bankruptcy proceedings. No other loans of this industry type remain in our portfolio. This was partially offset by continued strong asset quality metrics and loan portfolio contraction. In 2021, economic conditions improved allowing for a partial reduction in the additional qualitative adjustments made in 2020. This contributed to the level of the benefit recorded in 2021. In addition, specific reserves on impaired loans decreased by $646,000 from $1.2 million at December 31, 2020 to $565,000 at December 31, 2021. When excluding PPP loans, which are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, total loans decreased by $133.2 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Net loan recoveries were $531,000 in 2021 compared to net loan chargeoffs of $2.8 million in 2020.
Our overall weighted average commercial loan grade has been below 4.00 for the past several years. Our weighted average commercial loan grade was 3.60 at December 31, 2021 and 3.71 at December 31, 2020.
The amounts of loan loss provision in each period were the result of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels believed necessary based upon our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance. The sustained level of net recoveries over the past several years has had a significant effect on the historical loss component of our methodology. More information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for establishing its level may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading “Allowance for Loan Losses” below and in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Noninterest Income: Noninterest income totaled $23.7 million in 2021 compared to $24.0 million in 2020. The components of noninterest income are shown in the table below (in thousands):
- 26 -
Net gains on sales of mortgage loans decreased $1.8 million from 2020 to 2021 due to higher sales volumes in 2020. Net gains on mortgage loans included gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans in the secondary market. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate mortgage loans we originate. We do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell.
A summary of gain on sales of loans and related loan volume was as follows (in thousands):
As demonstrated in the table above, volume of mortgage loans originated for sale, while elevated, was down in 2021 compared to 2020. The low rate environment in the past two years has significantly impacted mortgage sale production volume. As long-term market interest rates impacting mortgage rates began to rise in the latter half of 2021, mortgage production slowed and resulting gains declined.
Deposit service charges were up $416,000, primarily driven by growth in treasury management fee income charged to our commercial customers and, to a lesser extent, growth in overdraft fee income. The improvement in treasury management fee income was a result of success in growing the number of business and municipal customers using these services in the last two years. Overdraft fees are driven by customer spending behavior and this activity tracked with the overall effect of government shutdowns on the economy, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, which was most impacted by the COVID-19 response. The stimulus checks sent by the federal government also helped our customers keep their accounts from overdrawing. As the economy began to normalize and customers used the economic impact payments, customer spending behavior began to return to normal.
Trust service revenue increased $573,000 in 2021. This increase was due partially to improvements in market valuations of assets on which fees are assessed, but also due to success in growing our customer base in both personal trust and retirement plan services.
ATM and debit card processing income increased $806,000 in 2021 to $6.5 million compared to $5.7 million in 2020. This increase reflected an increase in usage from customers compared to 2020 when COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. By the end of 2020 and throughout 2021, the volume had rebounded to above average levels reflecting customer preference for this payment alternative. There was overall growth in the number of debit and ATM card customers and promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continue to be successful.
We did not sell any securities in 2021 or 2020. We continually review our securities portfolio and will dispose of securities that pose higher than desired credit or market risk, or as warranted from overall portfolio maintenance or asset-liability management.
Investment services fees decreased $30,000 in 2021. The fees in 2020 were elevated due to the sale of a business by one of our customers with proceeds being invested in an annuity.
Earnings from bank owned life insurance increased by $159,000 in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the general performance of the underlying investments and the purchase of an additional $10.0 million of bank owned life insurance in the second quarter of 2021.
Other income, excluding investment services, was down by $419,000 in 2021 due largely to fees collected on customer back-to-back interest rate swaps. These fees were $8,000 in 2021 compared to $420,000 in 2020.
- 27 -
Noninterest Expense: Noninterest expense was $46.1 million in 2021 and $45.7 million in 2020. The slight increase in total noninterest expense reflected our active management of controllable costs. The components of noninterest expense are shown in the table below (in thousands):
Salaries and benefits expense was the largest component of noninterest expense and was $25.2 million in 2021 and $25.5 million in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in variable compensation tied to lower mortgage loan production in 2021, lower medical insurance costs resulting from lower claims experience in 2021 and lower 401k matching costs as we reduced our matching percentage for 2021 to 100% of the first 2% of salary contributions. This was increased back to normal level beginning January 1, 2022 at 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of salary contributions. The table below identifies the primary components of salaries and benefits (in thousands):
Costs associated with nonperforming assets remained at low levels, totaling $45,000 in 2021 and $115,000 in 2020. These costs included legal costs, repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense and losses (gains) on repossessed and foreclosed properties. Repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense included survey and appraisal, property maintenance and management and other disposition and carrying costs. Net (gains) losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties included both net gains and losses on the sale of properties and unrealized losses from value declines for outstanding properties.
These costs are itemized in the following table (in thousands):
During 2021, we did not add any other real estate properties and sold $170,000 of other real estate and repossessed assets, allowing for another reduction in our year-end balance, bringing it from $2.5 million at December 31, 2020 to $2.3 million at December 31, 2021. In 2020, we did not add any other real estate properties and sold $192,000 of other real estate.
FDIC assessment expense increased to $749,000 in 2021 compared to $400,000 in 2020 primarily due to our asset growth and assessment credits applied during 2020. Assessment credits of $266,000 were applied in 2019, leaving approximately $172,000 in assessment credits which were fully utilized in 2020. There were no assessment credits applied in 2021. Further discussion regarding the determination of FDIC assessments for the Bank may be found in Item 1 of this report under the heading "Supervision and Regulation."
- 28 -
Occupancy expense increased by $31,000 in 2021 primarily due to an increase in snow removal and building maintenance, partially offset by depreciation of our buildings. Furniture and equipment expense increased by $262,000 in 2021 primarily due to an increase in equipment service contracts and software, partially offset by a decrease in equipment repairs.
Data processing expenses were $3.5 million in 2021 and $3.4 million in 2020. Increases in data processing for our systems and card programs in 2021 and costs associated with our conversion to a new online banking service in 2020 were the primary reasons for the increase in 2021.
Federal Income Tax Expense: We recorded federal income tax expense of $6.7 million in 2021 and $6.6 million in 2020. Our effective tax rate was 18.78% for 2021 and 18.00% for 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received the final distribution of a partnership interest we had acquired in a loan settlement. This removed the uncertainty regarding our realization of the related deferred tax asset and, as such, the $92,000 valuation allowance we had established at December 31, 2018 was reversed at December 31, 2020.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Summary: Total assets were $2.93 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $286.7 million from $2.64 billion at December 31, 2020. This change reflected increases of $368.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $179.2 million in securities available for sale, $57.5 million in securities held to maturity, and $10.0 million in bank owned life insurance, offset by decreases of $320.3 million in our loan portfolio, $4.0 million in loans held for sale, $2.0 million in other assets, $1.5 million in accrued interest receivable, $1.4 million in premises and equipment, and $193,000 in other real estate owned. Total deposits increased by $279.4 million and other borrowed funds and long-term debt were down by $5.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $14.2 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Shareholders’ equity was increased by $29.0 million of net income in 2021, partially offset by cash dividends of $10.9 million, or $0.32 per share. Shareholders’ equity also decreased by $4.5 million in 2021 as a result of a swing in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the effect of interest rate movement on the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Our cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and short-term investments, were $1.15 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $783.7 million at December 31, 2020. This $368.1 million increase was primarily the result of an inflow of balances from our deposit customers due to federal stimulus distributions and our customers' uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Securities: Securities available for sale ("AFS") were $416.1 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $236.8 million at December 31, 2020. The balance at December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, agency mortgage backed securities and various municipal investments. The growth in securities AFS was the result of increased purchase activity to accelerate the strategic deployment of excess liquid funds caused by our robust deposit growth. Investment purchases were focused on short-term high quality securities consistent with our existing portfolio. Our held to maturity ("HTM") portfolio increased from $79.5 million at December 31, 2020 to $137.0 million at December 31, 2021. Our HTM portfolio is comprised of state aid notes and locally sourced municipal and commercial bonds. The commercial bond component of this category declined by $2.9 million in 2021. These bonds represent financing provided to some of our non-profit commercial customers who qualified for borrowing on a tax-exempt basis. The municipal bond component of this category increased by $60.4 million as we seized opportunities to deploy excess liquid funds in local, high quality, private placement municipal bonds with short durations.
Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality: Total portfolio loans decreased by $320.3 million to $1.11 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2020. During 2021, our commercial portfolio decreased by $281.2 million, while our residential mortgage portfolio decreased by $31.7 million and our consumer portfolio decreased by $7.4 million. The SBA created the Paycheck Protection Program to provide an efficient means to provide funding for small businesses to maintain payroll and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were an active participant in this program and originated a total of 1,738 loans totaling $346.7 million in 2020 and a total of 1,000 loans totaling $128.1 million in 2021. Borrowers who use the funds from their PPP loans to maintain payroll and for certain fixed expenses such as rent, occupancy, etc. are eligible to have 100% of their loans forgiven by the SBA. Through December 31, 2020, we had received disbursement of $113.5 million from the SBA for approved forgiveness applications. In 2021, we received disbursement of $318.4 million from the SBA for approved forgiveness applications, leaving $41.9 million in remaining balance of PPP loans at December 31, 2021, compared to $229.1 million at December 31, 2020.
The volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 as mortgage interest rates began to rise in late 2021, slowing down refinancing activity. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $124.3 million in 2021 compared to $156.4 million in 2020.
- 29 -
We experienced year over year decline in commercial loans in 2021 after experiencing growth in commercial loan balances for the previous three years. Commercial loans grew $16.0 million in 2019, $119.6 million in 2020 and decreased $281.2 million in 2021. As discussed previously, most of the growth in 2020 and decline in 2021 was attributable to PPP loan activity. We plan for measured, high quality loan portfolio growth in 2022.
Commercial and commercial real estate loans remained our largest loan segment and accounted for 84.4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 85.2% at December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage and consumer loans comprised 15.6% of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 14.8% at December 31, 2020.
A further breakdown of the composition of the loan portfolio is shown in the table below (in thousands):
(1)
Includes both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate.
Commercial real estate loans decreased $36.1 million since December 31, 2020 and accounted for 46.5% of our total loan portfolio at year-end 2021 and consisted primarily of loans to business owners and developers of owner and non-owner occupied commercial properties and loans to developers of single and multi-family residential properties. In the table above, we show our commercial real estate portfolio by loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, and by stage of development. Improved loans are generally secured by properties that are under construction or completed and placed in use. Development loans are secured by properties that are in the process of development or fully developed. Vacant and unimproved loans are secured by raw land for which development has not yet begun and agricultural land.
Our overall commercial and industrial loan portfolio, including PPP, decreased by $245.1 million to $420.3 million at December 31, 2021 and represented 37.9% of our total loan portfolio. As discussed above, this decrease includes $187.1 million net reduction in outstanding balances on PPP loans, due to SBA forgiveness.
Our consumer residential mortgage loan portfolio, which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners, comprised approximately 10.7% of portfolio loans at December 31, 2021 and 10.5% at December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to retain in our loan portfolio certain types of residential mortgage loans (primarily high quality, low loan to value, adjustable rate loans) in an effort to continue to diversify our credit risk and deploy our excess liquidity. A large portion of our residential mortgage loan production continues to be sold on the secondary market with servicing released.
The volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale during 2021 decreased from 2020 as interest rates increased in 2021 and demand for refinancings declined as many potential borrowers have recently refinanced in the extended low interest rate environment. In addition, customer preference drove more production in loan product types we sell on the secondary market (i.e. fixed-rate long-term mortgages). As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no repurchase demands or claims related to residential mortgage loans sold on the secondary market during the five-year period ended December 31, 2021.
- 30 -
Our portfolio of other consumer loans includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans. Consumer loans decreased by $7.4 million to $54.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $62.2 million at December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in home equity loans. Consumer loans comprised approximately 4.9% of our portfolio loans at December 31, 2021 and 4.3% at December 31, 2020.
The following table shows our loan origination activity for portfolio loans during 2021 and 2020, broken out by loan type and also shows average originated loan size (dollars in thousands):
The table above demonstrates that our loan origination activity in 2021 was lower than in 2020, but was significantly impacted by PPP loan originations in 2020. Excluding PPP, we had higher loan originations in 2021 than 2020. We believe the increased origination activity (excluding PPP activity) is primarily the result of increased business activity occurring in our marketplace as uncertainty over economic conditions with the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
Our loan portfolio is reviewed regularly by our senior management, our loan officers, and an internal loan review team that is independent of our loan originators and credit administration. An administrative loan committee consisting of senior management and seasoned lending and collections personnel meets monthly to manage our internal watch list and proactively manage high risk loans.
When reasonable doubt exists concerning collectability of interest or principal of one of our loans, the loan is placed in nonaccrual status. Any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings.
Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets and repossessed assets. At December 31, 2021, nonperforming assets totaled $2.4 million compared to $3.1 million at December 31, 2020. There were no additions to other real estate owned in 2021 or in 2020. Based on the loans currently in their redemption period, we expect there to be few additions to other real estate owned in 2022. Proceeds from sales of foreclosed and repossessed properties were $170,000 in 2021, resulting in a net realized loss on sale of $20,000. Proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties were $192,000 in 2020 resulting in a net realized gain on sale of $13,000.
Nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status and loans delinquent more than 90 days but still accruing. As of December 31, 2021, nonperforming loans totaled $92,000, or 0.01% of total portfolio loans, compared to $533,000, or 0.04% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2020.
Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021 consisted of $5,000 of commercial real estate loans secured by various types of non-residential real estate, $1,000 of commercial and industrial loans and $86,000 of consumer and residential mortgage loans.
- 31 -
Foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans. Foreclosed assets totaled $2.3 million at December 31, 2021 and $2.5 million at December 31, 2020. Of this balance at December 31, 2021, there was 1 commercial real estate property totaling approximately $2.3 million. All properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure are initially transferred at their fair value less estimated costs to sell and then evaluated monthly for impairment after transfer using a lower of cost or market approach. Updated property valuations are obtained at least annually on all foreclosed assets.
At December 31, 2021, our foreclosed asset portfolio had a weighted average age held in portfolio of 9.77 years. Below is a breakout of our foreclosed asset portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 by property type and the percentages the property has been written down since taken into our possession and the combined writedown percentage, including losses taken when the property was loan collateral (dollars in thousands):
The following table shows the composition and amount of our nonperforming assets (dollars in thousands):
The following table shows the breakout of our troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) between performing and nonperforming at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Included in nonperforming asset table above
The following table further shows the composition of our TDRs over the past five years (dollars in thousands):
- 32 -
We had a total of $7.5 million and $9.4 million of loans whose terms have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These loans may have involved the restructuring of terms to allow customers to mitigate the risk of foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. These may also include loans that renewed at existing contractual rates, but below market rates for comparable credit. For each restructuring, a comprehensive credit underwriting analysis of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms is performed to assess whether the structure can be successful and that cash flows will be sufficient to support the restructured debt. An analysis is also performed to determine whether the restructured loan should be on accrual status. Generally, if the loan is on accrual at the time of restructure, it will remain on accrual after the restructuring. In some cases, a nonaccrual loan may be placed on accrual at restructuring if the loan’s actual payment history demonstrates it would have cash flowed under the restructured terms. After six consecutive payments under the restructured terms, a nonaccrual restructured loan is reviewed for possible upgrade to accruing status. In situations where there is a subsequent modification or renewal and the loan is brought to market terms, including a contractual interest rate not less than a market interest rate for new debt with similar credit risk characteristics, the TDR and impaired designations may be removed.
As with other impaired loans, an allowance for loan loss is estimated for each TDR based on the most likely source of repayment for each loan. For impaired commercial real estate loans that are collateral dependent, the allowance is computed based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. For impaired commercial loans where repayment is expected from cash flows from business operations, the allowance is computed based on a discounted cash flow computation. Certain groups of TDRs, such as residential mortgages, have common characteristics and for them the allowance is computed based on a discounted cash flow computation on the change in weighted rate for the pool. The allowance allocations for commercial TDRs where we have reduced the contractual interest rate are computed by measuring cash flows using the new payment terms discounted at the original contractual rate.
In March 2020, guidance issued by the federal banking agencies in consultation with FASB and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act collectively specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. Through December 31, 2021, the Bank had applied this guidance and modified 726 individual loans with aggregate principal balances totaling $337.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, all of these modifications had expired and the loans were performing in accordance with their contractual payment terms.
Allowance for loan losses: Determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective. Timely identification of risk rating changes within the commercial loan portfolio is key to our process of establishing an appropriate allowance balance. The internal risk rating system is discussed below.
The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was $15.9 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, compared to $17.4 million at December 31, 2020. The balance of the allowance for loan losses was 1.43% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.22% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2020. The ratio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was impacted by $41.9 million and $229.1 million of remaining PPP loans, respectively. The ratio excluding these loans was 1.49% and 1.45% at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loan coverage ratio remained high at 17,271% at December 31, 2021 compared to 3,266% at December 31, 2020.
The following is a summary of certain key ratios regarding allowance activity and coverage.
The continued low level of net charge-offs over the last several years has had a significant effect on the historical loss component of our allowance for loan losses computation.
- 33 -
The table below shows the changes in these metrics over the past five years:
Nonperforming loans have been low over the past several years. At December 31, 2021, we have had net loan recoveries in twenty-six of the past twenty-eight quarters. Perhaps even more importantly, our total delinquencies 30 days and greater have continued to be minimal, and were just $129,000 at December 31, 2021.
The provision for loan losses was a benefit of $2.1 million for 2021 compared to an expense of $3.0 million for 2020. The provision in each period was impacted by the levels of nonperforming loans and net charge-off/recovery experience. The 2020 provision was also impacted by a $4.1 million charge-off on a single commercial loan relationship. We had net recoveries in 2021 totaling $531,000 compared to net charge-offs of $2.8 million in 2020. The ratio of net charge-offs / (recoveries) to average loans was (0.04%) for 2021 compared to 0.19% for 2020.
Despite the unique charge-off we incurred in 2020, we are encouraged by the low level of charge-offs over the past several years. We do, however, recognize that future charge-offs and resulting provisions for loan losses are expected to be impacted by the timing and extent of changes in the overall economy and the real estate markets.
Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed appropriate based upon our assessment of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance and related provision for loan losses relies on several key elements, which include specific allowances for loans considered impaired, general allowance for commercial loans not considered impaired based upon applying our loan rating system, and general allocations based on historical trends for homogeneous loan groups with similar risk characteristics.
Impaired loans decreased $3.1 million, or 29%, to $7.5 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $10.6 million at December 31, 2020. The specific allowance for impaired loans decreased $645,000 to $565,000, or 7.5% of total impaired loans, at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.2 million, or 11.4% of total impaired loans, at December 31, 2020.
Specific allowances are established on individually impaired credits where we believe it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Specific allowances are determined based on discounting estimated cash flows over the life of the loan or based on the fair value of collateral supporting the loan. For commercial real estate loans, generally appraisals are used to estimate the fair value of the collateral and determine the appropriate specific allowance. Estimated selling costs are also considered in the estimate. When it becomes apparent that liquidation of the collateral is the only source of repayment, the collateral shortfall is charged off rather than carried as a specific allowance.
The general allowance (referred to as “formula allowance”) allocated to commercial loans that were not considered to be impaired was based upon the internal risk grade of such loans. We use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system. Loans are stratified between real estate secured and non-real estate secured. The real estate secured portfolio is further stratified by the type of real estate. Each stratified portfolio is assigned a loss allocation factor. Generally, a worse grade assigned to a loan category results in a greater allocation percentage. Changes in risk grade of loans affect the amount of the allowance allocation.
The determination of our loss factors is based upon our actual loss history by loan grade and adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the analysis date. We use a rolling 18 month (6 quarter) actual net charge-off history as the base for our computation for commercial loans. The 18 month period ended December 31, 2021 reflected net recoveries for most of our loan pools. We addressed this volatility in the qualitative factor considerations applied in our allowance computation. We also considered the extended period of improved asset quality in assessing the overall qualitative component.
We also have considered the effect of COVID-19 on our loan borrowers and our local economy. While significant stimulus and mitigation efforts were expected to soften the impact, we believed a downgrade to our economic qualitative factor was appropriate and we added 7 basis points to this qualitative factor at March 31, 2020. Additional allocations were provided in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, this factor was decreased by 2 basis points in recognition of improved economic conditions but additional allocations were made to other factors for a net increase of 8 basis points in the quarter. In the second quarter 2021, we added 20 basis points to our consumer loan portfolio qualitative factors to address the risk that economic impact payments may be masking consumer delinquency and default. We maintained these qualitative factors in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Reflecting improvement in our local economy, in the fourth quarter of 2021 we reduced the overall economic qualitative factor by 6 basis points.
- 34 -
Considering the change in our qualitative factors and changes in our commercial loan portfolio balances, the general commercial loan allowance decreased $821,000 to $12.9 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $13.8 million at December 31, 2020. The qualitative component of our allowance allocated to commercial loans was $12.9 million at December 31, 2021, down from $13.7 million at December 31, 2020.
Groups of homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and open- and closed-end consumer loans, receive allowance allocations based on loan type. A rolling 12 month (4 quarter) historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. As with commercial loans that are not considered impaired, the determination of the allowance allocation percentage is based principally on our historical loss experience. These allocations are adjusted for consideration of general economic and business conditions, credit quality and delinquency trends, collateral values, and recent loss experience for these similar pools of loans. The homogeneous loan allowance was $2.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2020.
As noted above, the formula allowance allocated to commercial loans that are not considered to be impaired is calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk rating of such loans. We use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system. Loans rated a 4 or better are considered of acceptable risk. Loans rated a 5 exhibit above-normal risk to the Company and warrant a greater level of attention by management. These loans are subject to on-going review and assessment by our Administrative Loan Committee. Loans rated a 6 or worse are considered substandard, doubtful or loss, exhibit a greater relative risk of loss to the Company based upon the rating and warrant an active workout plan administered by our Special Asset Group.
The qualitative factors assessed and used to adjust historical loss experience reflect our assessment of the impact of economic trends, delinquency and other problem loan trends, trends in valuations supporting underlying collateral, changes in loan portfolio concentrations, effect of changes in interest rates on loan collectability, competition and changes in internal credit administration practices have on probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Qualitative adjustments are inherently subjective and there can be no assurance that these adjustments have properly identified probable losses in our loan portfolio. More information regarding the subjectivity involved in determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."
The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type at the dates indicated.
- 35 -
The components of the allowance for loan losses were as follows:
With the exception of certain TDRs, impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2021 were classified as substandard or worse per our internal risk rating system. $2.7 million of residential mortgage TDRs were associated with programs approved by the U.S. government during 2009 to minimize the number of consumer foreclosures. These loans involved the restructuring of terms on consumer mortgages to allow customers to mitigate foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. Also included in this category are certain consumer home equity loans that were restructured maturing home equity lines of credit that did not qualify for traditional term financing. We have been actively working with our customers to reduce the risk of foreclosure using these programs. Additional information regarding impaired loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 may be found in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our weighted average loan grade was 3.67 at December 31, 2019, 3.71 at December 31, 2020 and 3.60 at December 31, 2021. The decrease of $1.4 million in reserves on commercial loans for 2021 was due to a $573,000 decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans and a $821,000 decrease in the loss allocation factor on non-impaired loans at December 31, 2021.
Of the $15.9 million allowance at December 31, 2021, 4% related to specific allocations on impaired loans, 81% related to formula allowance on commercial loans and 15% related to general allocations for homogeneous loans. Of the $17.4 million allowance at December 31, 2020, 7% related to specific allocations on impaired loans, 79% related to formula allowance on commercial loans and 14% related to general allocations for homogeneous loans. Of the $15.3 million total formula based allowance for loan loss allocations at December 31, 2021, $15.3 million is from general/environmental allocations and $70,000 was driven from historical experience. Of the $16.2 million total formula based allowance for loan loss allocations at December 31, 2020, $16.1 million is from general/environmental allocations and $56,000 is driven from historical experience. The above allocations are not intended to imply limitations on usage of the allowance. The entire allowance is available for any loan losses without regard to loan type.
More information regarding steps to address the elevated levels of substandard, impaired and nonperforming loans may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading "Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality" above and in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain industry sectors will be more negatively impacted than others by the economic effects of COVID-19 and governmental action. For example, businesses that thrive on large masses of people assembling in close proximity, such as hospitality, restaurants and sporting events will likely incur longer lasting negative effects than other industries. We believe our commercial portfolio is adequately diversified, with our largest commercial concentrations in Real Estate, Rental and Leasing (31%), followed by Manufacturing (14%) and Retail Trade (10%).
- 36 -
The table below breaks down our commercial loan portfolio by industry type at December 31, 2021 and identifies the percentage of loans in each type that have a pass rating within our grading system (4 or better) and criticized rating (5 or worse) (dollars in thousands):
Accommodations and Food Services in the table above includes our loans to restaurants and hotels. We have reviewed each relationship in this industry group and have determined based upon their nature of operations and our loan structure that we believe our loss exposure is limited.
Although we believe our allowance for loan losses has captured the losses that are probable in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021, there can be no assurance that all losses have been identified or that the allowance is sufficient.
Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment totaled $41.8 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $43.3 million at December 31, 2020 as capital additions were more than offset by depreciation of current facilities during 2021.
Bank owned life insurance (BOLI):
The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash surrender value and totaled $52.5 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $42.5 million at December 31, 2020. The Bank purchased an additional $10.0 million of BOLI in the second quarter of 2021.
Deposits and Other Borrowings: Total deposits increased $279.4 million to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2021, as compared to $2.30 billion at December 31, 2020. The majority of the increase in deposits in both 2020 and 2021 can be attributed to fiscal stimulus provided by the federal government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The stimulus funds ultimately increased the deposit balances of our retail, commercial and municipal customers. Noninterest checking account balances increased $76.7 million in 2021. Interest bearing demand account balances increased $93.7 million and savings and money market account balances increased $122.8 million in 2021 while our certificates of deposits (primarily short-term) decreased by $13.8 million in 2021. We believe our success in maintaining and increasing the balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts was primarily attributable to our focus on quality customer service, the desire of customers to deal with a local bank, the convenience of our branch network and the breadth and depth of our product line.
Noninterest bearing demand accounts comprised 34% of total deposits at December 31, 2021 compared to 35% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. Because of the generally low rates paid on interest bearing account alternatives, many of our business customers chose to keep their balances in these more liquid noninterest bearing demand account types. Interest bearing demand, money market and savings accounts, comprised 62% of total deposits at December 31, 2021 and 60% at December 31, 2020. Time accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 3% at December 31, 2021 and 5% at December 31, 2020.
- 37 -
Borrowed funds totaled $85.0 million at December 31, 2021 comprised of $85.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Borrowed funds totaled $90.6 million at December 31, 2020 including $70.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances and $20.6 million in long-term debt associated with trust preferred securities. The $5.6 million decrease in borrowed funds in 2021 was due to the addition of a single $25.0 million putable advance with the Federal Home Loan Bank executed in the third quarter 2021 after a $10 million advance maturity in the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by the redemption of our remaining trust preferred securities. The $25 million advance carried an interest rate of just 0.01%. The FHLB exercised its put option and it was repaid as required on January 21, 2022.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding $20.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of pooled trust preferred securities (“TRUPs”) issued through its wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trust, Macatawa Statutory Trust II (issued $20.0 million aggregate liquidation amount with a floating interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.75%). On July 7, 2021, the Company redeemed all of the long-term debt associated with trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no remaining trust preferred securities outstanding.
Information regarding our off-balance sheet commitments may be found in Item 8 of this report in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $14.2 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Shareholders’ equity was increased by $29.0 million of net income in 2021, partially offset by cash dividends of $10.9 million, or $0.32 per share. Shareholders’ equity decreased by $4.5 million in 2021 as a result of a swing in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the effect of interest rate movement on the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines.
Our regulatory capital ratios (on a consolidated basis) continue to significantly exceed the levels required to be categorized as “well capitalized” according to the requirements specified by the rules implementing Basel III.
The following table shows our regulatory capital ratios (on a consolidated basis) for the past three years.
Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends to common shareholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014, and each subsequent quarter in 2014 through 2021. The declaration and payment of future dividends to common shareholders will be considered by the Board of Directors in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition and anticipated profitability.
Capital sources include, but are not limited to, additional private and public common stock offerings, preferred stock offerings and subordinated debt.
Macatawa Bank:
The Bank was categorized as "well capitalized" at December 31, 2021 and 2020 according to the requirements specified by the rules implementing Basel III. The following table shows the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios for the past three years.

LIQUIDITY
Liquidity of Macatawa Bank: The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to manage a variety of sources and uses of funds. Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows categorize these sources and uses into operating, investing and financing activities. We primarily focus on developing access to a variety of borrowing sources to supplement our deposit gathering activities and provide funds for our investment and loan portfolios. Our sources of liquidity include our borrowing capacity with the FRB's discount window, the Federal Home Loan Bank, federal funds purchased lines of credit and other secured borrowing sources with our correspondent banks, loan payments by our borrowers, maturity and sales of our securities available for sale, growth of our deposits, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, and the various capital resources discussed above.
Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of our customers. Our customers may be either borrowers with credit needs or depositors wanting to withdraw funds. Our liquidity management involves periodic monitoring of our assets considered to be liquid and illiquid, and our funding sources considered to be core and non-core and short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term. We have established parameters that monitor, among other items, our level of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, our level of non-core funding reliance and our level of available borrowing capacity. We maintain a diversified wholesale funding structure and actively manage our maturing wholesale sources to reduce the risk to liquidity shortages. We have also developed a contingency funding plan to stress test our liquidity requirements arising from certain events that may trigger liquidity shortages, such as rapid loan growth in excess of normal growth levels or the loss of deposits and other funding sources under extreme circumstances.
We maintain a non-core funding dependency ratio below our peer group average and have had no brokered deposits on our balance sheet since before December 2012. At December 31, 2021, the Bank held $1.13 billion of federal funds sold and other short-term investments as well as $411.2 million of unpledged securities available for sale. In addition, the Bank’s available borrowing capacity from correspondent banks was approximately $225.4 million as of December 31, 2021.
In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations which are considered in our overall liquidity management.
In addition to normal loan funding, we also maintain liquidity to meet customer financing needs through unused lines of credit, unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The level and fluctuation of these commitments is also considered in our overall liquidity management. At December 31, 2021, we had a total of $677.9 million in unused lines of credit, $128.6 million in unfunded loan commitments and $10.1 million in standby letters of credit.
Liquidity of Holding Company: The primary sources of liquidity for the Company are dividends from the Bank, existing cash resources and the capital markets if the need to raise additional capital arises. Banking regulations and the laws of the State of Michigan in which our Bank is chartered limit the amount of dividends the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year. Under the state law limitations, the Bank is restricted from paying dividends to the Company in excess of retained earnings. In 2020, the Bank paid dividends to the Company totaling $11.7 million. In the same period, the Company paid dividends to its shareholders totaling $10.9 million. In 2021, the Bank paid dividends to the Company totaling $33.1 million. In the same period, the Company paid dividends to its shareholders totaling $10.9 million. The Company retained the remaining balance in each period for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had a retained earnings balance of $83.1 million.
During 2021 and 2020, the Company received payments from the Bank totaling $8.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, representing the Bank’s intercompany tax liability for the 2021 and 2020 tax years, respectively, in accordance with the Company’s tax allocation agreement.
The Company’s cash balance at December 31, 2021 was $7.8 million. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES:
To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, other real estate owned valuation, loss contingencies and income taxes are deemed critical due to the required level of management judgment and the use of estimates, making them particularly subject to change.
Our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is described above in the "Allowance for Loan Losses" discussion. This area of accounting requires significant judgment due to the number of factors which can influence the collectability of a loan. Unanticipated changes in these factors could significantly change the level of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. Although, based upon our internal analysis, and in our judgment, we believe that we have provided an adequate allowance for loan losses, there can be no assurance that our analysis has properly identified all of the probable losses in our loan portfolio. As a result, we could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that we recorded in 2021.
- 39 -
Assets acquired through or instead of foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. New real estate appraisals are generally obtained at the time of foreclosure and are used to establish fair value. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Estimating the initial and ongoing fair value of these properties involves a number of factors and judgments including holding time, costs to complete, holding costs, discount rate, absorption and other factors.
Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. This, too, is an accounting area that involves significant judgment. Although, based upon our judgment, internal analysis, and consultations with legal counsel we believe that we have properly accounted for loss contingencies, future changes in the status of such contingencies could result in a significant change in the level of contingent liabilities and a related impact to operating earnings.
Our accounting for income taxes involves the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes. At December 31, 2021, we had gross deferred tax assets of $4.1 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $1.9 million resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $2.2 million. Accounting standards require that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. With the positive results in 2021 and positive future projections, we concluded at December 31, 2021 that no valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset was required. Changes in tax laws, changes in tax rates, changes in ownership and our future level of earnings can impact the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset.
