Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussions are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances.

Trends and Uncertainties
On July 28, 2017, we closed the reverse acquisition transaction under the Securities Exchange Agreement dated March 16, 2017, as reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on August 3, 2017. Following the closing, our business has been that of OXYS, Inc. and HereLab, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries. Our operations have varied significantly following the closing since, prior to that time, we were an inactive shell company.
Impact of COVID-19
During the year 2020, the effects of a new coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our business. The impact of COVID-19 on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 was limited, in all material respects, due to the government mandated numerous measures, including closures of businesses, limitations on movements of individuals and goods, and the imposition of other restrictive measures, in its efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the country.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Governments around the world have mandated, and continue to introduce, orders to slow the transmission of the virus, including but not limited to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.
Historical Background
We were incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003 under the name of Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation and subsequently changed our name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. on May 18, 2015. We commenced operations in the beauty supply industry as of January 1, 2004. On November 30, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of our wholesale and retail beauty supply business. From January 1, 2009 until July 28, 2017, we had no operations and were a shell company.
On March 16, 2017, our Board of Directors adopted resolutions, which were approved by shareholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to change our name to “IIOT-OXYS, Inc.”, to authorize a change of domicile from New Jersey to Nevada, to authorize a 2017 Stock Awards Plan, and to approve the Securities Exchange Agreement (the “OXYS SEA”) between the Company and OXYS Corporation (“OXYS”), a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 4, 2016.
Under the terms of the OXYS SEA we acquired 100% of the issued voting shares of OXYS in exchange for 34,687,244 shares of our Common Stock. We also cancelled 1,500,000 outstanding shares of our Common Stock and changed our management to Mr. DiBiase who also served in management of OXYS. Also, one of our principal shareholders entered into a consulting agreement with OXYS to provide consulting services during the transition. The OXYS SEA was effective on July 28, 2017, and our name was changed to “IIOT-OXYS, Inc.” at that time. Effective October 26, 2017, our domicile was changed from New Jersey to Nevada.
On December 14, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “HereLab SEA”) with HereLab, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HereLab”), and HereLab’s two shareholders pursuant to which we would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of HereLab in exchange for the issuance of 1,650,000 shares of our Common Stock, on a pro rata basis, to HereLab’s two shareholders. The closing of the transaction occurred on January 11, 2018 and HereLab became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
At the present time, we have two, wholly-owned subsidiaries which are OXYS Corporation and HereLab, Inc., through which our operations are conducted.
General Overview
IIOT-OXYS, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and OXYS, were originally established for the purposes of designing, building, testing, and selling Edge Computing systems for the Industrial Internet. Both companies were, and presently are, early-stage technology startups that are largely pre-revenue in their development phase. HereLab is also an early-stage technology development company. We received our first revenues in the last quarter of 2017, continued to realize revenues until 2020 when the pandemic hit, and we realized nominal revenues through 2021.
We develop hardware, software and algorithms that monitor, measure and predict conditions for energy, structural, agricultural and medical applications. We use domain-specific Artificial Intelligence to solve industrial and environmental challenges. Our engineered solutions focus on common sense approaches to machine learning, algorithm development and hardware and software products.
We use off the shelf components, with reconfigurable hardware architecture that adapts to a wide range of customer needs and applications. We use open-source software tools, while still creating proprietary content for customers, thereby reducing software development time and cost. The software works with the hardware to collect data from the equipment or structure that is being monitored.
We focus on developing insights. We develop algorithms that help our customers create insights from vast data streams. The data collected is analyzed and reports are created for the customer. From these insights, the customer can act to improve their process, product or structure.
Liquidity and Capital Resources for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
At December 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $46,821, which represents a $56,253 decrease from the $103,074 cash balance at December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily as a result of net cash used in operating activities of $628,103, cash received from convertible notes payable of $521,850 and cash received from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock of $50,000. Our working capital deficit at December 31, 2021 was $1,108,787, as compared to a working capital deficit of $2,665,436 at December 31, 2020, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a net loss of $1,063,554. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $628,103 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $2,236,774. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $117,138 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $571,850, consisting of cash received from the issuance of Convertible Notes payable of $521,850 and cash proceeds from sale of Series B Preferred Stock of $50,000, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $196,000, consisting of cash received from the issuance of Convertible Notes payable of $129,300, cash proceeds from sale of Series B Preferred Stock of $130,000, cash payments on notes payable of $100,000, and cash received from the PPP of $36,700.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we have incurred net loss from operations of $1,063,554 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and net loss of $2,236,774 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and have an accumulated deficit of $8,544,232 as of December 31, 2021, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we earned revenues of $11,280 and incurred related cost of sales of $2,040. We incurred professional fees of $508,153, payroll costs of $301,707, and other general and administrative expenses of $79,282. We recorded net other expenses of $161,333, net of other income of $269,666, primarily due to gain on change in the fair market value of derivative liability of $102,966, gain on extinguishment of debt of $120,000, other income of $46,7000 consisting of forgiveness of PPP Loan of $36,700 and EIDL advance of $10,000, offset by interest expense of $430,999 on notes payable due to amortization of debt discount and interest payable on notes payable. We also recorded $22,320 as preferred stock dividend on convertible preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, we incurred a net loss of $1,063,554 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Comparatively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we earned revenues of $36,771 and incurred related cost of sales of $15,044. We incurred professional fees of $802,135, payroll costs of $137,220, and other general and administrative expenses of $109,016. We incurred other expenses of $1,208,467, net of other income of $5,000, primarily due to the loss on change in the fair market value of derivative liability of $220,325, interest expense of $737,541 on notes payable due to amortization of debt discount and interest payable on notes payable, loss on the derivatives and loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also recorded $1,663 as preferred stock dividend on convertible preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, we incurred a net loss of $2,236,774 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the current and prior period, we did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty associated with the Company’s ability to utilize the deferred tax assets.
Year over Year (YoY) revenue was less in 2021 than 2020. This was due to several reasons, including: the negative business impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic and longer than anticipated customer acquisition times. These two factors led to cash flow issues, which in turn led to additional and aging accounts payable. Our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021 disclosed risks of ongoing concerns, and those concerns still exist. Despite cash flow issues, cost cutting and capital infusions allowed us to weather a difficult year in 2021. Despite these headwinds, our achievements in 2021 were significant: The successful pilot for our Fortune 500 Pharma customer allowed our strategic partner, Aingura IIoT, S.G., to win an initial contract with ArcelorMittal, which manufactures steel in 17 countries. That contract resulted in subcontracts for AI and Machine Learning services for our company and recorded as revenue in our third and fourth quarters. Our successful full year of structural health monitoring and analysis on several bridges for a New England state’s DOT pilot resulted in new business for our partner, Aingura IIoT, S.G. and anticipated future business for our company. Aingura won a Phase 1 contract for a Spanish Railway Bridge Monitoring project, and Oxys won a commitment from our current customer, the New England state’s DOT, to extend our bridge monitoring contract in 2022. These accomplishments are proof that our successful pilots in our key industry verticals have resulted in new business and will continue to do so in 2022 and beyond. Also, the strength of the Aingura IIoT, S.G. collaboration agreement has bolstered financial stability, added talent breadth and depth, and provides complimentary industry segment experience. Furthermore, liquidity of our stock has attracted funding that gives us access to additional capital. This capital will enable the funding of business development, staff augmentation, and inorganic growth opportunities.
It is anticipated that 2022 YoY revenue growth will meet or exceed that of 2021. This is due to these aforementioned reasons: the strength of the Aingura IIoT, S.G. collaboration, two successful pilots in our key target industries, use cases and marketing collateral from the pilots’ data and algorithms, experienced leadership, savvy technological talent, and operational execution excellence. Our continued focus on high potential growth markets (specifically Biotech, Pharma, and Medical Device Operations), have yielded numerous prospects for future growth. Furthermore, the strength of our target market, Industry 4.0, continues: Market research shows the worldwide Industry 4.0 market in 2021 was $64.9 billion and is projected to be $165.5 billion by 2026 (20.6% CAGR). We believe our strengths in these markets will yield breakthroughs in new contracts with current customers, as well as new customers in all targeted industry segments. By combining the resulting organic growth with inorganic growth, we believe these revenue goals are achievable.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2023, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial statements.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB and do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include:
1. an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
2. an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
3. an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
4. reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of the exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies required to adopt these new requirements.
