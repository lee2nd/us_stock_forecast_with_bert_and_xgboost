ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to exercise its judgment. We exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. Areas in which we exercise significant judgment include, but are not necessarily limited to, our valuation of accounts receivable, inventory, income taxes, equity transactions (compensatory and financing) and contingencies.
We base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions, the attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary.
While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.
For a Summary of Critical Accounting Policies, please refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3.
Results of Continuing Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
The following table shows our consolidated total revenue and revenue by geographic region for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021:
The decrease in United States revenues for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year of $1.6 million, is primarily the result of our transition from a direct sales force to a distributor model for our dermatology and eye care prescription products in the United States. Under the old direct sales model, our revenues were higher due to higher retail pricing than what we agreed to with the distributors. However, our operating expenses are also much lower under this new arrangement as we do not have to manage a sales force, provide patient rebates or manage product substitutions. Revenue for our animal health products declined slightly. Revenue for wound care products increased 19% from the prior year.
As a result of the asset purchase agreement and arrangement we entered into on October 27, 2016 with Invekra,with our assistance Invekra built up their own manufacturing of HOCl products and we manufactured products for Invekra at cost during the transition time. Invekra began their own manufacturing in November 2020. As we previously disclosed, we expected our revenues to decline following the transition of Invekra towards their own manufacturing. Since November 2020, we continue to process overflow orders for Invekra but we do so at market prices and at lower volumes. As a result of the foregoing, Latin America revenue declined by $3.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the year ended March 31, 2021.
The decrease in Europe and Rest of the World revenues for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of decreases in disinfectant sales in the Middle East due to the pandemic receding and to a lesser extent a slight decline in European sales.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit
The cost of revenue and gross profit metrics are as follows:
The gross margin decrease of 3% for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the year ended March 31, 2021 is a result of product mix and higher sales to distributors versus sales through our direct sales force.
Research and Development Expense
The research and development metrics are as follows:
For the year ended March 31, 2022, research and development expenses decreased as a result the closure of our research and development facility in Seattle, Washington and its relocation to our facility in Mexico.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
The selling, general and administrative expense metrics are as follows:
The increase in Selling, General and Administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2022 was primarily the result of an increase in our insurance premiums.
Interest (Expense) Income, net
Interest (expense) income, net was $(10,000) and $4,000, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.
Forgiveness of PPP loan
On May 1, 2020, we received loan proceeds in the amount of $1,310,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), from Coastal States Bank in Atlanta, Georgia. We used the loan amount for eligible purposes, such as payroll expenses. For the year ended March 31, 2022, we received approval for loan forgiveness in the amount of $723,000.
Other Expense, net
Other expense, net for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, was $394,000 and $594,000, respectively. The decrease in other expense, net relates primarily to a reduction in foreign exchange losses.
Gain on Sale of Assets
For the year ended March 31, 2022, we sold equipment for a gain of $150,000. Gain on the sale of assets for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $137,000. We sold fixed assets no longer needed after closing our Petaluma manufacturing facility.
Income Tax Benefit (Expense)
Income tax benefit (expense) for the year ended March 31, 2022 was $332,000 compared to $(713,000) for the year ended March 31, 2021. The increase in income tax benefit is the result of the reversal of the valuation allowance for Mexico as the result of three years of taxable income.
Net Loss from Continuing Operations
Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5,086,000 and $4,615,000, respectively.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Comparison of Year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
On June 24, 2020, we closed on an asset purchase agreement with Infinity Labs SD, Inc. We decided to divest our Micromed business, resulting in a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the divested Micromed operations meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations.
The related assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows for our Micromed business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
The operations of the Micromed business included in discontinued operations is summarized as follows:
Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2021, includes $770,000 of gain primarily from the value of the customer base of Micromed partially offset by a working capital adjustment.
Net Loss
The following table provides the net loss for each period along with the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We reported a net loss of $5,086,000 and $3,950,000 for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At March 31, 2022 and 2021, our accumulated deficit amounted to $184,363,000 and $179,277,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,396,000 compared to $4,220,000 on March 31, 2021. Since our inception, substantially all of our operations have been financed through sales of equity securities. Other sources of financing that we have used to date include our revenues, as well as various loans and the sale of certain assets to Invekra, Petagon, MicroSafe and Infinity Labs.
Since April 1, 2021, substantially all of our operations have been financed through the following transactions:
· Proceeds of $7,554,000 from sales on the ATM facility with HC Wainwright; and
· Proceeds of $217,000 from the exercise of stock options and warrants
The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 as well balances of cash and cash equivalents and working capital:
(1) Defined as current assets minus current liabilities.
As of March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,396,000 compared to $4,220,000 as of March 31, 2021.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2022 was $4,248,000, primarily due to a net loss of $5,086,000 and partially offset by an increase from accounts receivable net provision for write-offs and returns and an increase of $900,000 from deferred revenue.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2021 was $3,378,000, primarily due to a net loss of $3,950,000 for the period.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 was $99,000, primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $388,000, primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of our Micromed division of $610,000 partially offset by the purchase of equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 was $7,396,000 primarily related to proceeds of $7,554,000 from the sale of common stock on our At-the-Market facility with HC Wainwright, proceeds of $216,000 from the exercise of stock options and warrants, partially offset by the payments on PPP loan and long term debt.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $3,308,000, primarily related to proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of $2,287,000, and PPP loans of $1,310,000 partially offset by payments on long term debt.
We expect revenues to fluctuate and may incur losses in the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives, to penetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital.
Management believes that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means; however, we cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If the economic climate in the U.S. deteriorates, our ability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in our continued efforts to commercialize our products, which is critical to the realization of our business plan and our future operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Capital Expenditures
We currently forecast capital expenditures in order to execute on our business plan and maintain growth; however, the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures will ultimately be determined by the volume of business. We currently do not anticipate that a material amount will be purchased for the year ended March 31, 2023. If we purchase capital equipment, we expect to pay cash for those expenditures or to finance them through equipment leases.
Material Trends and Uncertainties
We are exposed to risk from decline in foreign currency for both the Euro and the Mexico Peso versus the US dollar. Most recently there has been a sharp decline in the Euro versus the US Dollar which has impacted our financial results.
As we have previously discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on July 14, 2021, we face a substantial Mexico tax liability, intercompany debt, unpaid technical assistance charges and accrued interest. These amounts are not due until 2027. At this time, management believes there are sufficient assets on the balance sheet to more than cover any tax obligation without interrupting the Company’s operations or business. We have engaged tax professionals to review all options to limit our exposure to these amounts and to proceed in a manner that is most advantageous to the Company.
As the pandemic continues to impact economies worldwide, we are closely watching inflation, increased volatility within financial markets, shipping costs, supply chain issues and labor costs. At this time, the overall impact of these issues has been minimal. The potential impact to our business operations, customer demand and supply chain due to increased shipping costs may ultimately impact sales. We continue to evaluate our end-to-end supply chain and assess opportunities to refine the impact on sales. Currently, most of our customers pay for shipping expenses, including increased shipping costs, if any. We have not yet faced labor shortages however it is possible we may have difficulties retaining and finding qualified employees in a tight labor market in the future. Furthermore, overall inflation tendencies may put pressure on our product pricing and/or costs.
We also closely monitor overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment and the prospect of a recession in the United States which may impact our financial results.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the recoverability of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and derivative instruments, debt discounts, valuation of investments and the estimated amortization periods of upfront product licensing fees received from customers.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
