ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward Looking Statements
Certain information contained herein includes forward looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Liquidation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in written form from time to time, reflect management’s good faith belief when those statements are made, and are based on information currently available to management. Caution should be exercised in interpreting and relying on such forward looking statements, the realization of which may be impacted by known and unknown risks and uncertainties, events that may occur subsequent to the forward looking statements, and other factors which may be beyond the Partnership’s control and which can materially affect the Partnership’s actual results, performance or achievements for 2021 and beyond. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties mentioned below materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
Along with risks detailed in Item 1A and from time to time in the Partnership’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, some factors that could cause the Partnership’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following:
● The Partnership depends on the real estate markets where its properties are located, primarily in Eastern Massachusetts, and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic market conditions, which are beyond the Partnership’s control.
● The Partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry, such as dependence on tenants’ financial condition, the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues and our ability to collect rents from our tenants.
● The Partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the Partnership’s tenants, such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the Greater Boston metropolitan area.
● The Partnership is subject to significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property.
● The Partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions.
● Civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters may result in uninsured or underinsured losses.
● Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.
● Financing or refinancing of Partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable, or may not be available on favorable terms.
● The Partnership properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect the Partnership’s ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents that can be charged.
● Given the nature of the real estate business, the Partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities. These include environmental contamination in the soil at the Partnership’s or neighboring real estate, whether caused by the Partnership, previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property, and the presence of hazardous materials in the Partnership’s buildings, such as asbestos, lead, mold and radon gas. Management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time.
● Insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain. In addition, insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies, which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the Partnership. These include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war, and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions. Coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
● Market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for Class A Partnership Units and Depositary Receipts as well as performance and cash flow.
● Changes in income tax laws and regulations may affect the income taxable to owners of the Partnership. These changes may affect the after-tax value of future distributions.
● The Partnership may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital; may be unable to sell poorly- performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly; or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties.
● Risk associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments.
● Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
● Any weakness identified in the Partnership’s internal controls as part of the evaluation being undertaken could have an adverse effect on the Partnership’s business.
● Ongoing compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may require additional personnel or systems changes.
The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive or as an admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the Partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said Act. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Since the Partnership’s long-term goals include the acquisition of additional properties, a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose. If available acquisitions do not meet the Partnership’s investment criteria, the Partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts. The Partnership will consider refinancing existing properties if the Partnership’s cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the Partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions.

Almost two years have passed since we became aware of the current outbreak of COVID- 19, a novel strain of coronavirus. The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. On March 10, 2020 the governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential businesses closed and prohibited the gathering of 10 or more people. Additionally, March of 2020 saw the closure of local colleges and universities for the balance of the academic year. Colleges in the City of Boston and the surrounding communities conducted classes in the 2020/2021 academic year remotely, or using a hybrid model of remote and limited in class learning. These educational models caused a large decrease in the student population and resulted in significant vacancies in the Partnership’s apartment portfolio.
With the roll out of Covid vaccines in the spring of 2021, the economy made great strides towards returning to a new normal. The Governor of Massachusetts rescinded the State’s Covid-19 restrictions on May 29 and terminated the State of Emergency on June 15. The local colleges and universities returned to campus in September 2021 and the rental market improved significantly as students returned to the area.
The vacancy rate for the Partnership’s residential properties as of February 1, 2022 was 1.7% as compared with a vacancy rate of 6.2% as of February 1, 2021. The vacancy rate for the Joint Venture properties as of February 1, 2022 was 1.4%, as compared to 15.5% for the same period last year. The current vacancy rates are in line with those experienced prior to the Pandemic.
Residential tenants generally have lease terms of 12 months. The majority of these leases will mature during the second and third quarters of the year. Rental activity continues to be been strong as we move from 2021 into 2022 and all indications are that we will have low vacancy rates for the foreseeable future.
During the prior state of emergency, The Hamilton Company, the Partnership’s property manager, had taken steps to maintain the safety of its employees and tenants. Hamilton continued to provide essential services to ensure all properties were kept open, fully functioning, and safe. Hamilton implemented a work from home policy with a skeleton staff present at all site offices to provide for property management, maintenance, leasing and construction services. Leasing was limited to unoccupied units unless permission was granted by the current tenant and a web-based video technology was being used to remotely show apartments. Hamilton and the Partnership will continue to adjust their business practices to comply with Federal and State mandates for workplace and rental property operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, rents increased on average 4.5% for renewals and increased on average 9.3% for new leases. For all of 2021, renewal rents increased approximately 2.5% and increased approximately 0.7% for new leases. For 2022, management expects the local real estate market to remain strong as we move from the winter into the spring rental season
For the year ending December 31, 2021, consolidated revenue increased by 0.9%, operating expenses increased by 2.7% and Income before Other Income (Expense) decreased by 4.9%. For the fourth quarter of 2021, consolidated revenue increased by 9.0%, operating expenses increased by 9.9% and Income before Other Income (Expense) increased by 5.3%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020
The Joint Ventures of 1025 Hancock and Hamilton Bay in 2019 sold out all remaining residential condominium units. 1025 Hancock sold 2 remaining units for a gain of approximately $306,000, and Hamilton Bay sold its 3 remaining units at a gain of approximately $429,000. The estimated profit to the Partnership for the sale of these units from 2014 through 2019 is approximately $7,168,000.
On November 30, 2021, New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”), entered into a Master Credit Facility Agreement ( the “Facility Agreement”) with KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”) dated as of November 30, 2021, with an initial advance in the amount of $156,000,000. Interest only on the debt at a fixed interest rate of 2.97% is payable on a monthly basis through December 31, 2031. The Partnership’s obligations under the Facility Agreement are secured by mortgages on certain properties pursuant to certain Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and Security Agreement and Fixture Filings (“Mortgages”). See schedule in Note 5, Mortgage Notes Payable, for the details of the transaction as it relates to the specific properties.
The Partnership used the proceeds to pay down approximately $65,300,000 of existing debt secured by 11 properties, along with approximately $2,700,000 in prepayment penalties. The remaining balance of approximately $89,000,000 will be used for general partnership purposes. See schedule in Note 5, Mortgage Notes Payable, for the details of the transaction as it relates to the specific properties.
On March 31, 2020, Nera Brookside Associates, LLC (“Brookside Apartments”), entered into a Mortgage Note with KeyBank National Associates ( KeyBank) in the principal amount of $6,175,000. Interest only payments on the Note are payable on a monthly basis at a fixed interest rate of 3.53% per annum, and the principal amount of the Note is due and payable on April 1, 2035. The Note is secured by a mortgage on the Brookside apartment complex located at 5-12 Totman Drive, Woburn, Massachusetts pursuant to a Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement dated March 31, 2020. The Note is guaranteed by the Partnership pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement dated March 31, 2020. Brookside Apartments used the proceeds of the loan to pay off an outstanding loan of approximately $2,390,000, with the remaining portion of the proceeds added to cash reserves. In connection with this refinancing, there were closing costs of approximately $136,000.
On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit. The term of the line is three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the
Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 2.5%. The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was subsequently extended until October 31, 2020.The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately $128,000.
On October 29, 2021, the Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for $25 million but is restricted to $17 million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phases out by December 31, 2022. During this period, the loan covenants are modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of $200 million to a net worth of $175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65% to a ratio of 70% until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5% to a yield of 8.5% until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0% until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to $25 million. The portfolio’s debt yield fell below the minimum of 8.5% to 8.04%.Consequently, as of December 31,2021, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is restricted to draw down any amount from the line of credit until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants.
On December 20, 2019, Mill Street Gardens, LLC and Mill Street Development, LLC, collectively referred to as Mill Street, wholly-owned subsidiaries of New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”) closed on a Purchase Agreement dated as of September 27, 2019 with Ninety-Three Realty Limited Partnership (the “Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Mill Street acquired Country Club Garden Apartments, a 181 unit apartment complex located at 57 Mill Street, Woburn, Massachusetts (the “Property”) for an aggregate purchase price of $59,550,000 . Mill Street funded $18,000,000 of the purchase price out of an existing line of credit, $10,550,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price out of cash reserves and the remaining $31,000,000 from the proceeds of the Loan. The closing costs were approximately $237,000. From the purchase price, the Partnership allocated approximately $1,282,000 for in- place leases, and approximately $136,000 to the value of tenant relationships. These amounts are being amortized over 12 and 36 months respectively.
On December 20, 2019, Mill Street entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Insurance Strategy Funding Corp. LLC providing for a loan (the “Loan”) in the maximum principal amount of $35,000,000, consisting of an initial advance of $31,000,000 and a subsequent advance of up to $4,000,000 if certain conditions are met. Interest on the Note is payable on a monthly basis at a fixed interest rate of: (i) 3.586% per annum with respect to the initial advance and (ii) the greater of (A) the sum of the market spread rate and the interpolated (based on the remaining term of the Loan) US Treasury rate at the time of the advance and (B) 3.500% with respect to any subsequent advance. The principal amount of the Note is due and payable on January 1, 2035. The Note is secured by a mortgage on the Property and is guaranteed by the Partnership pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement dated December 20, 2019.
The Stock Repurchase Program that was initiated in 2007 has purchased 1,434,189 Depositary Receipts through December 31, 2021, or approximately 33% of the outstanding Class A Depositary Receipts. The Partnership purchased 5,752 Depositary Receipts in 2021.
In March of 2020, the Board of Advisors and Board of Directors unanimously approved an extension of the Repurchase Program until March 31, 2025. Management believes that the $25,000,000 line of credit, net cash flow from operations and cash on hand have put the Partnership in position to capitalize on investment opportunities should they reveal themselves in the near future. As always, Management continues to weigh investment alternatives of stock repurchase, new property acquisitions and dispositions when considering its cash balances and performance of the portfolio. Given the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus issue, as of April 15, 2020, the Partnership elected to temporarily suspend the repurchase program, With the improving economic outlook and the return of students to universities in the Greater Boston area in the fall of 2021, the repurchase program was reinstated in November of 2021.
The Partnership has retained The Hamilton Company (“Hamilton”) to manage and administer the Partnership’s and Joint Ventures’ Properties. Hamilton is a full-service real estate management company, which has legal, construction, maintenance, architectural, accounting and administrative departments. The Partnership’s properties represent approximately 44% of the total properties and 50% of the residential properties managed by Hamilton.
Substantially all of the other properties managed by Hamilton are owned, wholly or partially, directly or indirectly, by the Brown Family related entities. The Partnership’s Second Amended and Restated Contract of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”) expressly provides that the general partner may employ a management company to manage the properties, and that such management company may be paid a fee of up to 4% of rental receipts for administrative and management services (the “Management Fee”). The Partnership pays Hamilton the full annual Management Fee, in monthly installments.
In addition to the Management Fee, the Partnership Agreement further provides for the employment of outside professionals to provide services to the Partnership and allows NewReal to charge the Partnership for the cost of employing professionals to assist with the administration of the Partnership’s properties. Additionally, from time to time, the Partnership pays Hamilton for repairs and maintenance services, legal services, construction services and accounting services. The costs charged by Hamilton for these services are at the same hourly rate charged to all entities managed by Hamilton, and management believes such rates are competitive in the marketplace.
In 2021, tenant renewals were approximately 67% with an average rental increase of approximately 2.5 %, new leases accounted for approximately 33% with rental rate increases of approximately 0.7%. In 2021, leasing commissions were approximately $835,000 compared to approximately $497,000 in 2020, an increase of approximately $338,000 (68.0%) from 2020. Tenant concessions were approximately $50,000 in 2021 compared to approximately $32,000 in 2020, an increase of approximately $18,000 (56.3%). Tenant improvements were approximately $1,991,000 in 2021 compared to approximately $2,062,000 in 2020, a decrease of approximately $71,000 (3.4%).
Hamilton accounted for approximately 2.2% of the repair and maintenance expense paid for by the Partnership in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the funds paid to Hamilton for this purpose, the great majority was to cover the cost of services provided by the Hamilton maintenance department, including plumbing, electrical, carpentry services, and snow removal for those properties close to Hamilton’s headquarters. Several of the larger Partnership properties have their own maintenance staff. Those properties that do not have their own maintenance staff and are located more than a reasonable distance from Hamilton’s headquarters in Allston, Massachusetts are generally serviced by local, independent companies.
Hamilton’s legal department handles most of the Partnership’s eviction and collection matters. Additionally, it prepares most long-term commercial lease agreements and represents the Partnership in selected purchase and sale transactions. Overall, Hamilton provided approximately 67.4% and 59.1% of the legal services paid for by the Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, The Hamilton Company receives similar fees from the Investment Properties.
The Partnership requires that three bids be obtained for construction contracts in excess of $15,000. Hamilton may be one of the three bidders on a particular project and may be awarded the contract if its bid and its ability to successfully complete the project are deemed appropriate. For contracts that are not awarded to Hamilton, Hamilton charges the Partnership a construction supervision fee equal to 5% of the contract amount. Hamilton’s architectural department also provides services to the Partnership on an as-needed basis. In 2021, Hamilton provided the Partnership approximately $581,000 in construction and architectural services, compared to $668,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Bookkeeping and accounting functions have been provided by Hamilton’s accounting staff, which consists of approximately 14 people. In 2021, Hamilton charged the Partnership $125,000 per year ($31,250 per quarter) for bookkeeping and accounting services. For more information on related party transactions, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires the Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures. The
Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Partnership’s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about such matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership’s financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Principles of Consolidation.
Revenue Recognition: Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Concessions made on residential leases are also accounted for on the straight-line basis.
Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases.
Under this standard, the Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs, we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred.
Rental Property Held for sale: When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets. The Partnership generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, and there are no significant contingencies relating to the sale. If, in management’s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established.
If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Partnership decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as held and used. A property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.
Rental Properties: Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction.
In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.
Intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values above and below market leases and tenant relationship values, which are based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the Partnership’s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership’s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in- place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships.
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset’s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.
Impairment: On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership’s rental properties may be impaired. A property’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership’s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management’s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analysis may not be achieved.
Investments in Joint Ventures: The Partnership accounts for its 40%-50% ownership in the Investment Properties under the equity method of accounting, as it exercises significant influence over, but does not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for the Partnership’s share in earnings, cash contributions and distributions. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the Partnership is included on the consolidated statements of income. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses.
The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the “primary beneficiary”). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE
that would be significant to the VIE.
With respect to investments in and advances to the Investment Properties, the Partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge is recorded if management’s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.
Legal Proceedings: The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it is determined that a loss is likely to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine.

Factors which contributed to the increase were an increase in Repairs and Maintenance expense of approximately $1,288,000, (14.7%), primarily due to a increase in appliance and pool repairs, an increase in Operating expenses of approximately $705,000 (12.2%), primarily due to an increase in utility expense, and an increase in Renting expense of approximately $377,000 (43.6%), partially due to an increase in leasing commission expense, offset in part by a decrease in Depreciation and Amortization expense of approximately $1,740,000 (9.4%), due to fully depreciated assets.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $13,629,000 compared to approximately $13,705,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately $76,000 (0.6%), primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on the line of credit of approximately $143,000.

The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to improvements in rental properties, partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures. The change in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the refinancing of 11 properties for approximately $156,000,000, partially offset by the pay down of the previous mortgages on these properties, and the paydown of the Line of Credit.
During 2021, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately $3,317,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves and, to some extent, escrow accounts established in connection with the financing or refinancing of the applicable Properties.

Line of Credit
On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit.

Prior to the line’s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a one-year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately $37,500 in association with the extension
On October 29, 2021, the Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for $25 million but is restricted to $17 million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phases out by December 31, 2022. During this period, the loan covenants are modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of $200 million to a net worth of $175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65% to a ratio of 70% until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5% to a yield of 8.5% until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0% until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to $25 million. The portfolio’s debt yield fell below the minimum of 8.5% to 8.04%.Consequently, as of December 31,2021, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is restricted to draw down any amount from the line of credit. until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants.
The interest rate for the new term is LIBOR plus 300 basis points. The costs associated with the modification and renewal of the line of credit is approximately $179,000. On December 3, 2021, the Partnership paid off the outstanding balance of $17,000,000 on the Line of Credit.
The line of credit may be used for acquisition, refinancing, improvements, working capital and other needs of the Partnership. The line may not be used to pay dividends, make distributions or acquire equity interests of the Partnership.
The line of credit is collateralized by varying percentages of the Partnership’s ownership interest in 23 of its subsidiary properties and joint ventures. Pledged interests range from 49% to 100% of the Partnership’s ownership interest in the respective entities.
The Partnership paid fees to secure the line of credit. Any unused balance of the line of credit, prior to the extension on October 29, 2021,was subject to a fee ranging from 15 to 20 basis points per annum. The Partnership paid approximately $10,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The Partnership anticipates that cash from operations and interest bearing accounts will be sufficient to fund its current operations, pay distributions, make required debt payments and to finance current improvements to its properties. The Partnership may also sell or refinance properties. The Partnership’s net income and cash flow may fluctuate dramatically from year to year as a result of the sale or refinancing of properties, increases or decreases in rental income or expenses, or the loss of significant tenants.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements-Joint Venture Indebtedness
As of December 31, 2021, the Partnership had a 40%-50% ownership interest in seven Joint Ventures, which all have mortgage indebtedness except Hancock 1025, and Hamilton Essex Development. We do not have control of these partnerships and therefore we account for them using the equity method of consolidation. At December 31, 2021, our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt before unamortized deferred financing costs related to these investments was approximately $70,918,000. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2021, we are subject to contractual payment obligations as described in the table below.
We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties.
See Notes 5 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage notes payable. The Partnership has no other material contractual obligations to be disclosed.
