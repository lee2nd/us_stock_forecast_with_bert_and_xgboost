Recent Developments
On January 19, 2022, we acquired FocalPoint Securities, LLC, an independent investment bank based in Los Angeles. The combination is expected to significantly expand B. Riley Securities’ mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) advisory business and enhance its debt capital markets and financial restructuring capabilities.

The firm includes approximately 50 investment banking professionals with deep industry specialization in high-growth sectors such as aerospace and defense, industrials, business services, consumer, healthcare, and technology/media/telecom. Our acquisition of FocalPoint builds upon the momentum and proven execution capabilities of both firms and is in line with our stated intent to expand capabilities in M&A advisory and fixed income. This combination provides strategic and financial sponsor clients with access to both firms’ proven execution capabilities and a full suite of end-to-end services from a single platform.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 outbreak”). In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continued to evolve, with the emergence of variant strains and breakthrough infections becoming prevalent both in the U.S. and worldwide. As the U.S. economy recovers, aided by stimulus packages and fiscal and monetary policies, inflation has been rising at historically high rates, and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin increasing the target federal funds effective rate. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and these related matters on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related advisories and restrictions and the success of vaccines and natural immunity in controlling the pandemic. These developments and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the financial markets and the overall economy continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy continue to be impacted, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

The increase was primarily due to increases in operating income of $355.6 million, gain on extinguishment of loans and other of $3.7 million, and income from equity investments of $3.4 million, partially offset by increases in provision for income taxes of $88.5 million, interest expense of approximately $27.2 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $6.9 million, preferred stock dividends of $2.7 million, and a decrease in interest income of $0.3 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our operations are funded through a combination of existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under our senior notes payable, term loans and credit facilities, and special purpose financing arrangements. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated net income attributable to the Company of $445.1 million and $205.2 million, respectively. Our cash flows and profitability are impacted by capital markets engagements performed on a quarterly and annual basis and amounts realized from the sale of our investments in marketable securities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $278.9 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $0.9 million of restricted cash, $1,532.1 million of securities and other investments, at fair value, $873.2 million of loans receivable, at fair value, and $2,033.3 million of borrowings outstanding. The borrowings outstanding of $2,033.3 million as of December 31, 2021 included $1,606.6 million of borrowings from the issuance of the series of senior notes that are due at various dates ranging from May 31, 2024 to August 31, 2028 with interest rates ranging from 5.00% to 6.75%, $346.4 million term loans borrowed pursuant to the BRPAC Credit Agreement and Nomura Credit Agreement discussed below, $80.0 million of revolving credit facility under the Nomura credit facility discussed below, and $0.4 million of notes payable.
We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, securities and other investments owned, funds available under our asset based credit facility, funds available under the BRPAC and Nomura term loans, funds available under the Nomura revolving credit facility, and cash expected to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance date of the accompanying financial statements. We continue to monitor our financial performance to ensure sufficient liquidity to fund operations and execute on our business plan.

Credit Agreements
Nomura Credit Agreement
On June 23, 2021, we, and our wholly owned subsidiaries, BR Financial Holdings, LLC (the “Primary Guarantor”), and BR Advisory & Investments, LLC (the “Borrower”) entered into a credit agreement (as amended prior to the Second Amendment (as defined below) the “Credit Agreement”) with Nomura Corporate Funding Americas, LLC, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”), for a four-year $200.0 million secured term loan credit facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a four-year $80.0 million revolving loan credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).
On December 17, 2021 (the “Amendment Date”), we, the Primary Guarantor, and the Borrower entered into a Second Incremental Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), by and among us, the Primary Guarantor, the Borrower, each of the subsidiary guarantors signatory thereto, each of the lenders party thereto, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, pursuant to which the Borrower established an incremental facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Incremental Facility” and the incremental term loans made thereunder, the “Incremental Term Loans”) of secured term loans under the Credit Agreement on terms identical to those applicable to the Term Loan Facility. The Borrower borrowed the full amount of the Incremental Term Loans on the Amendment Date. The Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility, and Incremental Facility, together, (“Credit Facilities”), mature on June 23, 2025, subject to acceleration or prepayment.
Eurodollar loans under the Credit Facilities accrue interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin of 4.50%. Base rate loans accrue interest at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which is determined by the average utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter.
Subject to certain eligibility requirements, the assets of certain subsidiaries of ours that hold credit assets, private equity assets, and public equity assets are placed into a borrowing base, which serves to limit the borrowings under the Credit Facilities. If borrowings under the Credit Facilities exceed the borrowing base, we are obligated to prepay the loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. The Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment contain certain representations and warranties (subject to certain agreed qualifications) that are customary for financings of this kind.
The Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment contain certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our, the Primary Guarantor’s, the Borrower’s, and the Borrower’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, to enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends or to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases in respect of their respective equity interests. In addition, the Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain Operating EBITDA of at least $135.0 million and the Primary Guarantor to maintain net asset value of at least $1,100.0 million. The Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment contain customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments under the credit facilities, cross-default, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events and customary change of control events.
Commencing on September 30, 2022, the Term Loan Facility and Incremental Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments of 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan as of the closing date with the remaining balance due at final maturity. Quarterly installments from September 30, 2022 to March 31, 2025 are in the amount of $3.8 million per quarter.
As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan Facility and Incremental Facility was $292.7 million (net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.4 million). Interest on the term loan during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.9 million (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of $0.8 million). The interest rate on the term loan as of December 31, 2021 was 4.72%.
We had an outstanding balance of $80.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021. Interest on the revolving facility during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.9 million (including unused commitment fees of $0.08 million and amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.3 million). The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 was 4.67%.
We are in compliance with all financial covenants in the Nomura Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
Wells Fargo Credit Agreement
On April 21, 2017, we amended the asset based credit facility agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank to increase the maximum borrowing limit from $100.0 million to $200.0 million. Such amendment, among other things, also extended the expiration date of the credit facility from July 15, 2018 to April 21, 2022. The Credit Agreement continues to allow for borrowings under a separate credit agreement (a “UK Credit Agreement”) dated March 19, 2015 with an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank which provides for the financing of transactions in the United Kingdom with borrowings up to 50.0 million British Pounds. Any borrowing on the UK Credit Agreement reduces the availability of the asset based $200.0 million credit facility. The UK Credit Agreement is cross collateralized and integrated in certain respects with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement continues to include the addition of our Canadian subsidiary, from the October 5, 2016 amendment to the Credit Agreement, to facilitate borrowings to fund retail liquidation transactions in Canada. From time to time, we utilize this credit facility to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with liquidation engagements. We also utilize this credit facility in order to issue letters of credit in connection with liquidation engagements conducted on a guaranteed basis. Subject to certain limitations and offsets, we are permitted to borrow up to $200.0 million under the credit facility, less the aggregate principal amount borrowed under the UK Credit Agreement (if in effect). Borrowings under the credit facility are only made at the discretion of the lender and are generally required to be repaid within 180 days. The interest rate for each revolving credit advance under the related credit agreement is, subject to certain terms and conditions, equal to the LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25% depending on the type of advance and the percentage such advance represents of the related transaction for which such advance is provided. The credit facility is secured by the proceeds received for services rendered in connection with the liquidation service contracts pursuant to which any outstanding loan or letters of credit are issued and the assets that are sold at liquidation related to such contract, if any. The credit facility also provides for success fees in the amount of 2.5% to 17.5% of the net profits, if any, earned on liquidation engagements that are financed under the credit facility as set forth in the related credit agreement. We typically seek borrowings on an engagement-by-engagement basis. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, merge, or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. There was no outstanding balance on this credit facility as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2021, there were no open letters of credit outstanding.
We are in compliance with all financial covenants in the asset based credit facility as of December 31, 2021.

On December 31, 2020, the Borrowers, the Secured Guarantors, the Agent, and the Closing Date Lenders, entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Lenders agreed to make a new $75.0 million term loan to the Borrowers, the proceeds of which the Borrowers’ will use to repay the outstanding principal amount of the existing Terms Loans and Optional Loans and for other general corporate purposes, (ii) the Borrowers were permitted to make a one-time Permitted Distribution (as defined in the Second Amendment) in the amount of $30.0 million on the date of the Second Amendment, (iii) the maturity date of the new Term Loans is five (5) years from the date of the Second Amendment, (iv) the interest rate margin was increased by 25 basis points as set forth in the Second Amendment, (v) the Borrowers agreed to make mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans from a portion of the Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (vi) the maximum Consolidated Total Funded Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was increased as set forth in the Second Amendment and (vii) the Company and B. Riley Principal Investments, LLC entered into a reaffirmation of their guarantees of the Borrowers’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Borrowers paid a commitment fee and an arrangement fee, each based on a percentage of the aggregate commitments, in each case upon the closing of the Second Amendment.
On December 16, 2021, the Borrowers, the Secured Guarantors, the Agent, and the Closing Date Lenders, entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) pursuant to which, among other things, replaced LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) reference rate and the Borrowers were permitted to make a one-time Permitted Distribution (as defined in the Third Amendment) in the amount of $30.0 million on the date of the Third Amendment.
The borrowings under the amended BRPAC Credit Agreement bear interest equal to the SOFR rate plus a margin of 2.75% to 3.25% depending on the Borrowers’ consolidated total funded debt ratio as defined in the BRPAC Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the interest rate on the amended BRPAC Credit Agreement was at 3.17% and 3.40%, respectively.

Interest expense on the term loan during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $2.5 million (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of $0.3 million) and $2.4 million (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of $0.3 million), respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On a continual basis, management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, management’s estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different and/or future circumstances. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
● it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
● changes in the estimate, or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected, could have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as valuation of securities, reserves for accounts receivable, the fair value of loans receivable, intangible assets and goodwill, share based arrangements and accounting for income tax valuation allowances, recovery of contract assets and sales returns and allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 outbreak”). In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continued to evolve, with the emergence of variant strains and breakthrough infections becoming prevalent both in the U.S. and worldwide. As the U.S. economy recovers, aided by stimulus packages and fiscal and monetary policies, inflation has been rising at historically high rates, and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin increasing the target federal funds effective rate. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and these related matters on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related advisories and restrictions and the success of vaccines and natural immunity in controlling the pandemic. These developments and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the financial markets and the overall economy continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy continue to be impacted, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenues under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.
Revenues from contracts with customers in the Capital Markets segment, Wealth Management segment, Auction and Liquidation segment, Financial Consulting segment, Principal Investments - Communications segment and Brands segment are primarily comprised of the following:
Capital Markets Segment - Fees earned from corporate finance and investment banking services are derived from debt, equity and convertible securities offerings in which the Company acted as an underwriter or placement agent. Fees from underwriting activities are recognized as revenues when the performance obligation for the services related to the underwriting transaction is satisfied under the terms of the engagement and is not subject to any other contingencies. Fees are also earned from financial advisory and consulting services rendered in connection with client mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, recapitalizations and other strategic transactions. The performance obligation for financial advisory services is satisfied over time as work progresses on the engagement and services are delivered to the client. The performance obligation for financial advisory services may also include success and performance based fees which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is no longer constrained and it is not probable that the revenue recognized would be subject to significant reversal in a future period. Generally, it is probable that the revenue recognized is no longer subject to significant reversal upon the closing of the investment banking transaction.
Fees from asset management services are recognized over the period the performance obligation for the services are provided. Asset management fees are primarily comprised of fees for asset management services and are generally based on the dollar amount of the assets being managed.
Revenues from sales and trading are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and include commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed as agent or principal and are recorded on a trade date basis and fees paid for equity research.
Revenues from other sources in the Capital Markets segment is primarily comprised of (i) interest income from loans receivable and securities lending activities, (ii) related net trading gains and losses from market making activities, the commitment of capital to facilitate customer orders, (iii) trading activities from our Principal Investments in equity and other securities for the Company’s account, and (iv) other income.
Interest income from securities lending activities consists of interest income from equity and fixed income securities that are borrowed from one party and loaned to another. The Company maintains relationships with a broad group of banks and broker-dealers to facilitate the sourcing, borrowing and lending of equity and fixed income securities in a “matched book” to limit the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in the market value or securities borrowed and securities loaned.
Other revenues include (i) net trading gains and losses from market making activities in our fixed income group, (ii) carried interest from our asset management recognized as earnings from financial assets within the scope of ASC 323 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and therefore will not be in the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In accordance with ASC 323 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, the Company will record equity method income (losses) as a component of investment income based on the change in our proportionate claim on net assets of the investment fund, including performance-based capital allocations, assuming the investment fund was liquidated as of each reporting date pursuant to each fund’s governing agreements, and (iii) other miscellaneous income.
Wealth Management segment - Fees from wealth management asset advisory services consist primarily of investment advisory fees that are recognized over the period the performance obligation for the services provided. Investment advisory and asset management fees are primarily comprised of fees for investment services and are generally based on the dollar amount of the assets being managed. Investment advisory fee revenues as a principal registered investment advisor (RIA) are recognized on a gross basis. Asset management fee revenues as an agent are recognized on a net basis.
Revenues from sales and trading are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and include commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed as agent and are recorded on a trade date basis.
Auction and Liquidation segment - Commission and fees earned on the sale of goods at Auction and Liquidation sales are recognized when evidence of a contract or arrangement exists, the transaction price has been determined, and the performance obligation has been satisfied when control of the product and risks of ownership has been transferred to the buyer. The commission and fees earned for these services are included in revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Under these types of arrangements, revenues also include contractual reimbursable costs.
Revenues earned from Auction and Liquidation services contracts where the Company guarantees a minimum recovery value for goods being sold at auction or liquidation are recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of services to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill the contract include labor and other direct costs incurred by the Company related to the contract. Due to the nature of the guarantees and performance obligations under these contracts, the estimation of revenue that is ultimately earned is complex and subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. It is common for these contracts to contain provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price upon completion of our performance obligations under the contract. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price at the most likely amount it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether or not to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance under the contract taking into consideration all historical, current and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. Costs that directly relate to the contract and expected to be recoverable are capitalized as an asset and included in advances against customer contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized as the services are transferred to the customer over the contract period, which generally does not exceed six months, and the expense is recognized as a component of direct cost of services. If, during the auction or liquidation sale, the Company determines that the total costs to be incurred on a performance obligation under a contract exceeds the total estimated revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined.
If the Company determines that the variable consideration used in the initial determination of the transaction price for the contract is such that the total recoveries from the auction or liquidation will not exceed the guaranteed recovery values or advances made in accordance with the contract, the transaction price will be reduced and a loss or negative revenue could result from the performance obligation. A provision for the entire loss as negative revenue on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined.
Financial Consulting Segment - Revenues in the Financial Consulting segment are primarily comprised of fees earned from providing bankruptcy, financial advisory, forensic accounting, real estate consulting and valuation and appraisal services. Fees earned from bankruptcy, financial advisory, forensic accounting and real estate consulting services are rendered to clients over time as work progresses on the engagement and services are delivered to the client. Fees may also include success and performance based fees which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is no longer constrained and it is not probable that the revenue recognized would be subject to significant reversal in a future period. Revenues for valuation and appraisal services are recognized when the performance obligation is completed and is generally at the point in time upon delivery of the report to the customer. Revenues in the Financial Consulting segment also include contractual reimbursable costs.
Principal Investments - Communications Segment - Revenues in the Principal Investments - Communications segment are primarily comprised of subscription services revenues which consist of fees charged to United Online pay accounts; revenues from the sale of the magicJack access rights; revenues from access rights renewals and mobile apps; prepaid minutes revenues; revenues from access and wholesale charges; service revenue from UCaaS hosting services; and revenues from mobile phone voice, text, and data services. Products revenues consist of revenues from the sale of magicJack, mobile phone, and mobile broadband service devices, including the related shipping and handling and installation fees, if applicable. This segment’s revenues also include advertising revenues which consist primarily of amounts from the Company’s Internet search partner that are generated as a result of users utilizing the partner’s Internet search services and amounts generated from display advertisements. The Company recognizes such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or, for performance-based arrangements, when the related performance criteria are met.
Subscription service revenues are recognized over time in the service period in which the transaction price has been determinable and the related performance obligations for services are provided to the customer. Fees charged to customers in advance are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue and then recognized ratably over the service period as the performance obligations are provided.
Product revenues for hardware and shipping are recognized at the time of delivery. Revenues from sales of devices and services represent revenues recognized from sales of the magicJack devices to retailers, wholesalers, or direct to customers, net of returns, and rights to access the Company’s servers over the period associated with the access right period, and from sales of mobile phones and voice, text, and data services. The transaction price for devices is allocated between equipment and service based on stand-alone selling prices. Revenues allocated to devices are recognized upon delivery (when control transfers to the customer), and service revenue is recognized ratably over the service term. The Company estimates the return of magicJack device direct sales as part of the transaction price using a six month rolling average of historical returns.
Brands Segment - Licensing revenue results from various license agreements that provide revenue based on guaranteed minimum royalty amounts and advertising/marketing fees with additional royalty revenue based on a percentage of defined sales. Guaranteed minimum royalty amounts are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the full contract term. Royalty payments exceeding the guaranteed minimum amounts in a specific contract year are recognized only subsequent to when the guaranteed minimum amount has been achieved. Other licensing fees are recognized at a point in time once the performance obligations have been satisfied.
Payments received as consideration for the grant of a license are recorded as deferred revenue at the time payment is received and recognized ratably as revenue over the term of the license agreement. Advanced royalty payments are recorded as deferred revenue at the time payment is received and recognized as revenue when earned. Revenue is not recognized unless collectability is probable.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management utilizes the expected loss model. Management also considers historical losses adjusted for current market conditions and the customers’ financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The bad debt expense is included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value.
Goodwill includes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The Codification requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. The Company operates five reporting units, which are the same as its reporting segments described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of reporting units which includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment.
When testing goodwill for impairment, in accordance with ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the Company made a qualitative assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on goodwill and other intangible assets. Based on the Company’s qualitative assessments during 2020, the Company concluded that a positive assertion can be made from the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no impairments were identified.
The Company reviews the carrying value of its amortizable intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows of such assets are less than the carrying amount, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, if any, exceeds its fair market value. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company determined that the COVID-19 outbreak was a triggering event for testing the indefinite-lived tradenames in the Brands segment during the first quarter and again in the second quarter and determined that the indefinite-lived tradenames in the Brands segment were impaired. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of $12,500, during the year ended December 31, 2020, which are included in restructuring charge in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized no impairment of intangibles.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company records securities and other investments owned, securities sold not yet purchased, and mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests that were issued after November 5, 2003 at fair value with fair value determined in accordance with the Codification. Our mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the three levels of fair value hierarchy. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments that are highly liquid, observable and actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable and can be corroborated by market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The fair value of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined based on the issuance of similar interests for cash, references to industry comparables, and relied, in part, on information obtained from appraisal reports and internal valuation models.
Investments in partnership interests include investments in private equity partnerships that primarily invest in equity securities, bonds, and direct lending funds. We also invest in priority investment funds and the underlying securities held by these funds are primarily corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities and restrictions exist on the redemption of amounts invested by the Company. The Company’s partnership and investment fund interests are valued based on the Company’s proportionate share of the net assets of the partnerships and funds; the value for these investments is derived from the most recent statements received from the general partner or fund administrator. These partnership and investment fund interests are valued at net asset value (“NAV”) in accordance with ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements.
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the notes payable (including credit lines used to finance liquidation engagements), long-term debt and capital lease obligations approximate fair value because the contractual interest rates or effective yields of such instruments are consistent with current market rates of interest for instruments of comparable credit risk.
Share-Based Compensation. The Company’s share based payment awards principally consist of grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Share based payment awards also include grants of membership interests in the Company’s majority owned subsidiaries. The grants of membership interests consist of percentage interests in the Company’s majority owned subsidiaries as determined at the date of grant. In accordance with the accounting guidance share based payment awards are classified as either equity or a liability. For equity-classified awards, the Company measures compensation cost for the grant of membership interests at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service or performance period the award is expected to vest.
In June 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“Purchase Plan”) which allows eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price that is 85% of the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation, the Company is required to recognize compensation expense relating to shares offered under the Purchase Plan.
Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company estimates the degree to which tax assets and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. A valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. Tax benefits of operating loss carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the related valuation allowance on such assets would be reduced.
The Company establishes a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. As a result of the common stock offering that was completed on June 5, 2014, the Company had a more than 50% ownership shift in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Accordingly, the Company is limited to the amount of net operating loss that may be utilized in future taxable years depending on the Company’s actual taxable income. As of December 31, 2019, the Company believes that the net operating loss that existed as of the more than 50% ownership shift will be utilized in future tax periods and it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable earnings will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets and has not provided an allowance.
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 2(ac) to the accompanying financial statements for recent accounting standards we have not yet adopted and recently adopted.
