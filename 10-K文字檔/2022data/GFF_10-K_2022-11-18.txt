Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)
OVERVIEW
The Company
Griffon Corporation (the “Company”, “Griffon”, "we" or "us") is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.
The Company was founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).
On September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Defense Electronics ("DE") segment, which consisted of our Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics") subsidiary. On June 27, 2022, we completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTMI) ("TTM") for $330,000 in cash, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. Since September 2021, we have classified the results of operations of our Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.
Griffon now conducts its operations through two reportable segments:
•Consumer and Professional Products (“CPP”) is a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. CPP sells products globally through a portfolio of leading brands including AMES, since 1774, Hunter, since 1886, True Temper, and ClosetMaid. CPP revenue was 47%, 54%, and 55% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Home and Building Products ("HBP") conducts its operations through Clopay. Founded in 1964, Clopay is the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Residential and commercial sectional garage doors are sold through professional dealers and leading home center retail chains throughout North America under the brands Clopay, Ideal, and Holmes. Rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use are sold under the Cornell and Cookson brands. HBP revenue was 53%, 46% and 45% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
On May 16, 2022, Griffon announced that its Board of Directors initiated a process to review a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and discussions with potential counterparties are ongoing with respect to a number of these options. The Committee on Strategic Considerations, a committee comprised of independent directors who serve on Griffon's Board, is overseeing the process and working with Griffon's management and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, the Company's financial advisor. There is no assurance that the process will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.
On December 17, 2021, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hunter Fan Company (“Hunter”), a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans, from MidOcean Partners (“MidOcean”) for a contractual purchase price of $845,000 and completed the acquisition on January 24, 2022. Hunter, part of our CPP segment, complements and diversifies our portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. We financed the acquisition of Hunter with a new $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility; we used a combination of cash on hand and revolver borrowings to fund the balance of the purchase price and related acquisition and debt expenditures.
On December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (“Quatro”), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of
glass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects. Quatro contributed approximately $5,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.
In August 2020 Griffon Corporation completed the public offering of 8,700,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds of $178,165 (the "Public Offering"). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The Company used the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
On February 19, 2020, Griffon issued, at par, $850,000 of 5.75% Senior Notes due in 2028 and on June 8, 2020 Griffon issued an additional $150,000 of notes under the same indenture at 100.25% of par (collectively the "2028 Senior Notes"). Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Senior Notes").
In January 2020, Griffon amended its credit agreement to increase the total amount available for borrowing from $350,000 to $400,000, extend its maturity date from March 22, 2021 to March 22, 2025 and modify certain other provisions of the facility (the "Credit Agreement").
On November 29, 2019, AMES acquired Vatre Group Limited ("Apta"), a leading United Kingdom supplier of innovative garden pottery and associated products sold to leading UK and Ireland garden centers for approximately $10,500 (GBP 8,750), inclusive of a post-closing working capital adjustment, net of cash acquired. This acquisition broadens AMES' product offerings in the UK market and increases its in-country operational footprint. Apta contributed approximately $20,000 in revenue in the first 12 months after the acquisition.
Update of COVID-19 on Our Business
The health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families is always a high priority for Griffon. As of the date of this filing, all of Griffon's facilities are fully operational. When COVID-19 struck, we implemented a variety of new policies and procedures, including additional cleaning, social distancing, staggered shifts and prohibiting or significantly restricting on-site visitors, to minimize the risk to our employees of contracting COVID-19. While many of these precautions have been relaxed or eliminated as the health risk of COVID-19 has decreased, we would not hesitate to reinstitute and/or modify these policies and procedures as necessary should the health risk return to an unacceptable level. In such event, our businesses or our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us. While we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we believe it is important to discuss where our company stands today, how we have responded (and will continue to respond) to COVID 19 and how our operations and financial condition may change as COVID-19 evolves. See information provided in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2022 Compared to 2021
Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 of $2,848,488 compared to $2,270,626 for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased 25% resulting from increased revenue at HBP and CPP of 45% and 9%, respectively. Hunter (purchased on January 24, 2022) contributed $246,474 of revenue in 2022.
Gross profit for 2022 was $936,886 compared to $641,113 in 2021. Gross profit as a percent of sales (“gross margin”) for 2022 and 2021 was 32.9% and 28.2%, respectively. In the years ended 2022 and 2021, gross profit included restructuring charges of $7,964 and $7,923, respectively. In the year ended 2022, gross profit also included amortization of $5,401 related to the fair value step-up of acquired inventory sold in connection with the Hunter Fan acquisition. Excluding these charges from both years, gross profit would have been $950,251 or 33.4% of revenue, compared to $649,036 or 28.6% in the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in 2022 of $608,926 increased 29% from $470,530 in 2021. The 2022 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $8,818, acquisition costs of $9,303, strategic review (retention and other) of $9,683, special dividend ESOP charges of $10,538, proxy expenses of $6,952. The 2021 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $13,495. Excluding these items from both periods, 2022 SG&A expenses would have been $563,632, or 19.8% of revenue compared to $457,035 or 20.1%, with the increase in expenses primarily due to the inclusion of expenses related to Hunter, which was acquired in January 2022, and increased distribution and shipping costs.
In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Griffon performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles. Indicators of impairment were present due to decreases in comparable company market multiples for the CPP reporting units and increased interest rates, and the related impact on weighted average cost of capital rates. Accordingly, a quantitative assessment was performed, which resulted in non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of $342,027 and $175,000. respectively, recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.
Interest expense in 2022 of $84,379 increased 34% compared to 2021 of $63,175, primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility entered into in connection with the Hunter acquisition, of which Griffon repaid $300,000 aggregate principal amount in the third quarter of 2022.
Other income (expense) of $6,881 and $2,107 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, includes $305 and ($81), respectively, of net currency exchange transaction gains (losses) from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, $(225) and $283, respectively, of net gains (losses) on investments, and $4,256 and $907, respectively, of net periodic benefit plan income. Other income (expense) also includes rental income of $689 in 2022 and $624 in 2021. Additionally, it includes royalty income of $2,250 for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Griffon reported Income (loss) before tax from continuing operations for 2022 of $(270,879) compared to $109,955 for 2021. In 2022, the Company had an effective income tax rate of (6.2)% compared to 36.1% in 2021. The 2022 tax rate included $3,913 of discrete and certain other tax provisions net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. The 2021 tax rate included $3,245 of discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. Excluding the discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below, the effective income tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 29.0% and 31.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.
Loss from continuing operations for 2022 was $287,715, or $5.57 per share, compared to Income from continuing operations of $70,302, or $1.32 per share in 2021. The 2022 income from continuing operations included the following:
- Restructuring charges of $16,782 ($12,479, net of tax, or $0.23 per share);
- Debt extinguishment, net $4,529 ($3,474, net of tax, or $0.06 per share);
- Acquisition costs of $9,303 ($8,149, net of tax, or $0.15 per share);
- Strategic review - retention and other of $9,683 ($7,280, net of tax, or $0.13 per share);
- Special dividend ESOP charges of $10,538 ($8,083, net of tax, or $0.15 per share);
- Proxy expenses of $6,952 ($5,359, net of tax, or $0.10 per share);
- Fair value step-up of acquired inventory sold of $5,401 ($4,012, net of tax, or $0.07 per share);
- Goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $517,027 ($454,753, net of tax, or $8.43 per share); and
- Discrete and certain other tax provision, net, of $3,913 or 0.07 per share.
The 2021 income from continuing operations included the following:
- Restructuring charges of $21,418 ($16,131, net of tax, or $0.30 per share); and
- Discrete and certain other tax provision, net, of $3,245 or $0.06 per share.
Excluding these items from both reporting periods, 2022 Income from continuing operations would have been $219,786, or $4.07 per share compared to $89,678, or $1.68 per share, in 2021.
2021 Compared to 2020
Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 of $2,270,626 compared to $2,066,546 in the year ended September 30, 2020 increased 10% resulting from increased revenue at HBP and CPP of 12% and 8%, respectively.
Gross profit for 2021 was $641,113 compared to $583,994 in 2020. Gross margin as a percent of sales (“gross margin”) for 2021 and 2020 was 28.2% and 28.3%, respectively. In the years ended 2021 and 2020, gross profit included restructuring charges of $7,923 and $4,159, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, gross profit would have been $649,036 or 28.6% of revenue, compared to $588,153 or 28.5% in the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in 2021 of $470,530 increased 6% from $444,454 in 2020. The 2021 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $13,495. The 2020 SG&A expenses included restructuring charges of $9,510, acquisition costs of $2,960 and income from the reversal of contingent consideration related to the Kelkay acquisition of $1,733. Excluding these items from both periods, the 2021 SG&A expenses would have been $457,035, or 20.1% of revenue compared to $433,717 or 21.0%, with the increase in expenses primarily due to increased distribution and shipping costs.
Interest expense in 2021 of $63,175 decreased 5% compared to 2020 of $66,544, primarily as a result of decreased outstanding borrowings and decreased variable interest rates on our Revolving Credit Facility.
Other income (expense) of $2,107 and $1,661 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, includes $81 and $915, respectively, of net currency exchange transaction losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, $283 and $184, respectively, of net gains on investments, and $907 and $1,559, respectively, of net periodic benefit plan income. Other income (expense) also includes rental income of $624 in both 2021 and 2020.
Griffon reported Income before tax from continuing operations for 2021 of $109,955 compared to $67,481 for 2020. In 2021, the Company had an effective income tax rate of 36.1% compared to 38.6% in 2020. The 2021 tax rate included $3,245 of discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. The 2020 tax rate included $966 of discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below. Excluding the discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, and other items that affect comparability, as listed below, the effective income tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 31.7% and 33.9%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.
Income from continuing operations for 2021 was $70,302, or $1.32 per share, compared to $41,444, or $0.92 per share in 2020. The 2021 income from continuing operations included the following:
- Restructuring charges of $21,418 ($16,131, net of tax, or $0.30 per share); and

Griffon evaluates performance based on Earnings (loss) per share and Income (loss) from continuing operations excluding non-cash impairment charges, restructuring charges, debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable. Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of Income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted income from continuing operations and Earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations to Adjusted earnings per common share from continuing operations:
GRIFFON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
RECONCILIATION OF INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
TO ADJUSTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
(Unaudited)
Note: Due to rounding, the sum of earnings per common share and adjusting items, net of tax, may not equal adjusted earnings per common share.
(1) Tax impact for the above reconciling adjustments from GAAP to non-GAAP Income from continuing operations and the related EPS is determined by comparing the Company's tax provision, including the reconciling adjustments, to the tax provision excluding such adjustments.
(2) Loss from continuing operations is calculated using basic shares on the face of the income statement. Per share impact of using diluted shares represents the impact of converting from the basic shares used in calculating earnings per share from the Loss from continuing operations to the diluted shares used in calculating earnings per share form the adjusted income from continuing operations.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Griffon evaluates performance and allocates resources based on each segment's operating results from continuing operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unallocated amounts (primarily corporate overhead), non-cash impairment charges, restructuring charges, debt extinguishment and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items that may affect comparability, as applicable (“Adjusted EBITDA”, a non-GAAP measure). Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.
See table provided in Note 18 - Reportable Segments, for a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income before taxes from continuing operations.
Consumer and Professional Products
2022 Compared to 2021
CPP revenue in 2022 increased $112,088, or 9%, compared to 2021, primarily resulting from a 20% or $246,474 contribution from the Hunter acquisition, and price and mix of 11%. These benefits were partially offset by a 20% reduction in volume primarily from reduced consumer demand and rebalancing of customer inventory levels in North America and the United Kingdom (U.K.), in part offset by Australia. Foreign exchange was an unfavorable impact of 2%.
CPP Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 decreased 14% to $99,308 compared to $115,673 in 2021. Excluding the Hunter contribution of $43,579, EBITDA of $55,729 decreased 52% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the reduced volume noted above and the related impact on manufacturing absorption, and increased material, labor and transportation costs, partially offset by the benefits of price and mix. The year ended September 30, 2022 included increased demurrage and detention costs, primarily related to COVID-19 and global supply chain disruptions, of approximately $15,172 ($9,512 related to Hunter).
Segment depreciation and amortization increased $13,129 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service and the Hunter assets acquired.
On January 24, 2022, Griffon completed the acquisition of Hunter Fan Company (“Hunter”), a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans for a contractual purchase price of $845,000. Hunter adds to Griffon's CPP segment, complementing and diversifying our portfolio of leading consumer brands and products.
On December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (“Quatro”), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of glass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects, for approximately AU$3,500.
Strategic Initiative and Restructuring Charges
In November 2019, Griffon announced the development of a next-generation business platform for CPP to enhance the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of its U.S. operations, and on November 12, 2020, Griffon announced that CPP was broadening this strategic initiative to include additional North American facilities, the AMES United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia businesses, and a manufacturing facility in China. On April 28, 2022, Griffon announced a reduced scope and an accelerated timeline for the initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2022. These changes reflect the rapid progress made with the
initiative, and reduced investment in facilities expansion and equipment given recent significant increases in construction and equipment costs. Any remaining expenditures, after the end of fiscal 2022, including those related to the deployment of AMES' global information systems, will be included in the continuing operations of the business. Future investments in equipment, particularly for automation, will be part of normal-course annual capital expenditures.
This initiative included three key development areas. First, certain AMES U.S. and global operations were consolidated to optimize facilities footprint and talent. Second, strategic investments in automation and facilities expansion were made to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing and fulfillment operations, and support e-commerce growth. Third, multiple independent information systems were unified into a single data and analytics platform, which will serve the whole AMES global enterprise.
We continue to expect that this initiative with result in annual cash savings of $25,000. Realization of expected cash savings will begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The cost to implement this new business platform, over the duration of the project, included one-time charges of approximately $51,869 and capital investments of approximately $15,000, net of future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities. Cumulative charges of $51,869 consisted of cash charges totaling $35,691 and non-cash, asset-related charges totaling $16,178; the cash charges included $12,934 for one-time termination benefits and other personnel-related costs and $22,757 for facility exit costs. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, CPP incurred pre-tax restructuring and related exit costs approximating $16,782 and $21,418, respectively. During the years ended September, 30, 2022 and 2021, capital expenditures of $6,337 and $8,774, respectively, were driven by investment in CPP business intelligence systems and e-commerce facility.
(a) Includes future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities.
2021 Compared to 2020
CPP revenue in 2021 increased $90,285, or 8%, compared to 2020, comprised of a 3% increase in volume, driven by increased consumer demand across all international geographies, partially offset by reduced volume in the U.S. due to labor, transportation and supply chain disruptions. Revenue also benefited from favorable price and mix of 1%, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of 4%.
CPP Adjusted EBITDA in 2021 increased $11,620 or 11% to $115,673 compared to $104,053 in 2020. The favorable variance resulted primarily from the increased revenue noted above and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 5%, partially offset by increased U.S. material costs coupled with the lag in realization of price increases and COVID-19 related inefficiencies.
Home and Building Products
2022 Compared to 2021
HBP revenue in 2022 increased $465,774, or 45%, compared to 2021, primarily due to favorable pricing and mix of 47% driven by both residential and commercial. Total volume decreased 2%, primarily due to labor and supply chain disruptions impacting residential deliveries, partially offset by increased commercial volume.
HBP Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 increased 128% to $412,738 compared to $181,015 in 2021. EBITDA benefited from the increased revenue noted above, partially offset by increased material, labor and transportation costs.
Segment depreciation and amortization decreased $831 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to fully depreciated assets.
2021 Compared to 2020
HBP revenue in 2021 increased $113,795, or 12%, compared to 2020, primarily due to favorable mix and pricing of 8% driven by both residential and commercial, and increased volume of 4% equally driven by both residential and commercial.
HBP Adjusted EBITDA in 2021 increased $27,384, or 18% to $181,015 compared to $153,631 in 2020. EBITDA benefited from the increased revenue noted above, partially offset by increased material costs coupled with the lag in realization of price increases and COVID-19 related inefficiencies.
Unallocated Amounts
For 2022, unallocated amounts, excluding depreciation, consisted primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $53,888 compared to $50,278 in 2021, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.
For 2021, unallocated amounts, excluding depreciation, consisted primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $50,278 compared to $49,487 in 2020, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization of $64,658 in 2022 compared to $52,302 in 2021; the increase was primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service and the Hunter assets acquired.
Depreciation and amortization of $52,302 in 2021 compared to $52,100 in 2020; the increase was primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
During 2022, total other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, of $(36,761) included a loss of $37,920 from foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the weakening of the British, Australian and Canadian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $1,503 gain from pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily associated with an increase in the assumed discount rate compared to 2021; and a $344 loss on cash flow hedges.
During 2021, total other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, of $26,115 included a gain of $6,433 from foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the British, Australian and Canadian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $17,796 gain from pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily related to the change between actual and expected return on assets compared to 2020; and a $1,886 gain on cash flow hedges.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Defense Electronics
On September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Defense Electronics segment, which consisted of Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics"), and on June 27, 2022, Griffon completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM for $330,000, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations unless noted otherwise.
At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon's discontinued assets and liabilities includes the Company's obligation of $8,846 in connection with the sale of Telephonics related to certain customary post-closing adjustments, primarily working capital and retention bonuses. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon’s liabilities for Installations Services and other discontinued operations primarily related to insurance claims, income taxes, product liability, warranty and environmental reserves totaled $10,049 and $7,074, respectively. See Note 8, Discontinued Operations.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
Management assesses Griffon’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon believes it has sufficient liquidity available to invest in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.
As of September 30, 2022, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $54,200. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and we do not currently anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event we determine that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we will be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds (unless applicable U.S. taxes have already been paid).
Griffon's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, cash on hand and our January 2025 five-year secured $400,000 revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company generated $59,240 of net cash from continuing operating activities and had $290,385 available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing on September 30, 2022.
The table below provides a summary of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods indicated.
Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2022 was $59,240 compared to $69,808 in 2021, a decrease of $10,568. For 2022, Net income from continuing operations adjusted for items to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was offset by increased working capital, predominately consisting of increased inventory, receivables and prepaid and other current assets and a decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income tax payable. For 2021, Net income from continuing operations adjusted for items to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was offset by increased working capital, predominately consisting of increased inventory, receivables, and prepaid and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income tax payable.
Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations is primarily comprised of capital expenditures and business acquisitions as well as proceeds from the sale of businesses, investments and property, plant and equipment.

Debt
At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Griffon had debt, net of cash and equivalents, as follows:
During 2020, Griffon issued, at par $1,000,000 of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Senior Notes"). Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Senior Notes"). In connection with the issuance and exchange of the 2028 Senior Notes, Griffon capitalized $16,448 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred, which will amortize over the term of such notes. Additionally, during 2020 Griffon recognized a $7,925 loss on the early extinguishment of debt of the 2022 Senior Notes, comprised primarily of the write-off of $6,725 of remaining deferred financing fees, $607 of tender offer net premium expense and $593 of redemption interest expense. Furthermore, all of the obligations associated with the 2022 Senior Notes were discharged.
During the year ended September 30, 2022, Griffon purchased $25,225 of 2028 Senior Notes in the open market at a weighted average discount of 91.82% of par, or $23,161. In connection with these purchases, Griffon recognized a $1,767 net gain on the early extinguishment of debt comprised of $2,064 of face value in excess of purchase price, offset by $297 related to the write-off of underwriting fees and other expenses. As of September 30, 2022, outstanding 2028 Senior Notes due totaled $974,775; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1.
The 2028 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. The 2028 Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") via an exchange offer. The fair value of the 2028 Senior Notes approximated $833,433 on September 30, 2022 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). At September 30, 2022, $10,939 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred remained to be amortized.
On January 24, 2022, Griffon amended and restated its Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") to provide for a new $800,000 Term Loan B facility, due January 24, 2029, in addition to its current $400,000 revolving credit facility ("Revolver"), and replaced LIBOR with SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate). The Term Loan B contains a SOFR floor of 0.50% and a current spread of 2.50%. Additionally, there are two interest rate step-downs tied to achieving decreased secured leverage ratio thresholds, the first of which was achieved during the year ended September 30, 2022. The Original Issue Discount for the Term Loan B was 99.75%. In connection with this amendment, Griffon capitalized $15,466 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred, which are being amortized over the term of the loan.
The Term Loan B facility requires nominal quarterly principal payments of $2,000, which began with the quarter ended June 30, 2022; potential additional annual principal payments based on a percentage of excess cash flow and certain secured leverage thresholds starting with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023; and a final balloon payment due at maturity. Term Loan B borrowings may generally be repaid without penalty but may not be re-borrowed. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Griffon prepaid $300,000 aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B, which permanently reduced the outstanding balance. In connection with the prepayment of the Term Loan B Griffon recognized a $6,296 charge on the prepayment of debt, $5,575 related to the write-off of underwriting fees and other expenses and $721 of the original issue discount. The Term Loan B facility is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants that apply to the Revolver, but is not subject to any financial maintenance covenants. Term Loan B borrowings are secured by the same collateral as the Revolver. The fair value of the Term Loan B facility approximated $476,160 on September 30, 2022 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). At September 30, 2022, $8,823 of underwriting fees and other expenses incurred remained to be amortized.
The Revolver's maximum borrowing availability is $400,000 and it matures on March 22, 2025. The Revolver includes a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $100,000; a multi-currency sub-facility of $200,000; and contains a customary accordion feature that permits us to request, subject to each lender's consent, an increase in the maximum aggregate amount that can be borrowed by up to an additional $100,000.
In addition, on December 9, 2021, Griffon replaced the Revolver GBP LIBOR benchmark rate with a Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA"). Borrowings under the Revolver may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a SOFR, SONIA or base rate benchmark rate, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 0.50% for base rate loans, 1.50% for SOFR loans and 1.50% for SONIA loans. The Revolver has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Both the Revolver and Term Loan B borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffon’s material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffon’s material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2022, under the Credit Agreement, there were $97,328 in outstanding borrowings; outstanding standby letters of credit were $12,287; and $290,385 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.
At September 30, 2022, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements. Net Debt to EBITDA (Leverage), as calculated in accordance with the definition in the Credit Agreement, was 2.89x at September 30, 2022.
Griffon has one finance lease outstanding for real estate located in Ocala, Florida. The lease matures in 2025 and bears interest at a fixed rate of approximately 5.6%. The Ocala, Florida lease contains two five-year renewal options. At September 30, 2022, $13,091 was outstanding. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the financing lease on the Troy, Ohio location expired. The lease bore interest at a rate of approximately 5.0%, was secured by a mortgage on the real estate, which was guaranteed by Griffon, and had a one dollar buyout at the end of the lease. Griffon exercised the one dollar buyout option in November 2021.
In November 2012, Garant G.P. (“Garant”), a Griffon wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a CAD 15,000 ($10,956 as of September 30, 2022) revolving credit facility. The facility accrues interest at LIBOR (USD) or the Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) plus 1.3% per annum (4.44% LIBOR USD and 4.76% Bankers Acceptance Rate CDN as of September 30, 2022). The revolving facility was amended and matures in October 2024, and is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender. Garant is required to maintain a certain minimum equity. As of September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility with CAD 15,000 ($10,956 as of September 30, 2022) available for borrowing.
In March 2022, Griffon Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and its Australian subsidiaries (collectively, "Griffon Australia") amended its AUD 18,375 term loan, AUD 20,000 revolver and AUD 15,000 receivable purchase facility agreement that was entered into in July 2016 and further amended in fiscal 2020. Griffon Australia paid off the term loan in the amount of AUD 9,625 and canceled the AUD 20,000 revolver. The amendment refinanced the existing AUD 15,000 receivable purchase facility. The receivable purchase facility matures in March 2023, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender. The receivable purchase facility accrues interest at BBSY (Bank Bill Swap Rate) plus 1.25% per annum (3.96% at September 30, 2022). At September 30, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the receivable purchase facility with AUD $15,000 ($9,722 as of September 30, 2022) available. The receivable purchase facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Griffon Australia and its subsidiaries. Griffon Australia is required to maintain a certain minimum equity level.
In July 2018, the AMES Companies UK Ltd and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Ames UK") entered into a GBP 14,000 term loan, GBP 4,000 mortgage loan and GBP 5,000 revolver. The term loan and mortgage loan require quarterly principal payments of GBP 438 and GBP 105 plus interest, respectively, and have balloon payments due upon maturity, July 2023, of GBP 7,088 and GBP 2,349, respectively. Effective in January 2022, the Term Loan and Mortgage Loan were amended to replace GBP LIBOR with SONIA. The Term Loan and Mortgage Loans each accrue interest at the SONIA Rate plus 1.80% (3.99% at September 30, 2022). The revolving facility accrues interest at the Bank of England Base Rate plus 3.25% (5.50% as of September 30, 2022). The revolving credit facility matures in July 2023, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender. As of September 30, 2022, the revolver had no outstanding balance while the term and mortgage loan balances amounted to GBP $11,060 ($12,090 as of September 30, 2022). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all the assets of AMES UK and its subsidiaries. AMES UK is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio.
Other long-term debt primarily consists of a loan with the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, with the balance consisting of finance leases.
Capital Resource Requirements
Griffon's debt requirements include principal on our outstanding debt, most notably our Senior Notes totaling $974,775 payable in 2028 and related annual interest payments of $57,105. As noted above, Griffon entered into a new $800,000 seven year Term Loan B facility with initial pricing of a SOFR floor of 50 basis points plus a spread of 275 basis points. The OID was 99.75. During the period ended June 30, 2022, Griffon prepaid $300,000 aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B, which permanently reduced the outstanding balance. The Term Loan B facility requires quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount, or $2,000, which began with the quarter ended June 30, 2022, and a balloon payment due at maturity.
Griffon's purchase obligations, which are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business over the next twelve months is approximately $184,422. Griffon uses blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to certain vendors. Purchase obligations reflect those purchase orders in which the commitment is considered to be firm.
Griffon rents real property and equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates. Operating lease obligations over the next twelve months is approximately $40,998. Refer to Note 21 - Leases.
Customers
A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. In 2022, Home Depot represented 13% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue, 19% of CPP's revenue and 7% of HBP's revenue.
No other customer exceeded 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s liquidity and operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of Griffon’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America (“GAAP”) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
An estimate is considered to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on Griffon’s financial position or results of operations. The following have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates:
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting. A contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved, that creates enforceable rights and obligations, has commercial substance and with respect to which payment terms are identified and collectability is probable. Once the Company has entered into a contract or purchase order, it is evaluated to identify performance obligations. For each performance obligation, revenue is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to the customer, or services are satisfied under the contract or purchase order, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services (the transaction price).
A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. A majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the product being sold to the customer. To a lesser extent, some contracts include multiple performance obligations such as a product, the related installation, and extended warranty services. These contracts require judgment in determining the number of performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contacts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of contracts, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. The transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts and volume rebates, when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration is determined using either the expected value or the most likely amount of consideration to be received based on historical experience and the specific facts and circumstances at the time of evaluation.
The Company’s performance obligations are recognized at a point in time related to the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products and components, and revenue is recognized when title, and risk and rewards of ownership, have transferred to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.
A majority of the Company's revenue is short cycle in nature with shipments occurring within one year from order and does not include a material long-term financing component, implicitly or explicitly. Payment terms generally range between 15 to 90 days and vary by the location of the business, the type of products manufactured to be sold and the volume of products sold, among other factors.
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when all factors are met, including when control of a product transfers to the customer upon its shipment, completion of installation, testing, certification or other substantive acceptance required under the contract. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations on the Company. From time-to-time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns experience. The Company includes shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in either Cost of Goods and Services and Selling, general and administrative expenses, as applicable.
The majority of the Company’s contracts offer assurance-type warranties in connection with the sale of a product to a customer. Assurance-type warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Such warranties do not represent a separate performance obligation.
Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the period between the time revenue is recognized and the time payment is due is not significant. Shipping and handling charges are not considered a separate performance obligation. Additionally, all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are excluded from revenue.
Inventories
Inventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or net realizable value, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.
Griffon’s businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, HBP produces residential and commercial sectional garage doors, commercial rolling steel door and grille products, and CPP produces long-handled tools and landscaping products, storage and organizational products and residential, industrial and commercial fans, all in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.
Warranty Accruals
Direct customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms of such warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products’ respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on such analysis, warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy.
Stock-based Compensation
Griffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees, officers and directors in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
Compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the required service period based on the fair value of the grant, calculated as the number of shares or units granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of grant, and for performance shares or units, the likelihood of achieving the performance criteria. For certain restricted stock grants with a performance metric related to Griffon's stock price, the company performs a valuation as of the date of grant and recognizes the expense over the vesting period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
Expected Loss Allowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and Returns
Trade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The expected loss allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers’ potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The expected loss allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.
Acquisitions
Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible Assets, and Impairment
As of September 30, 2022, the balance of goodwill on our balance sheet is $335,790 and indefinite-lived intangibles representing our trademarks is $399,668. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying amount. Such events or changes in circumstance include significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate in which our reporting units operate, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, when some portion of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as held for sale, or when a change in the composition of reporting units occurs for other reasons, such as a change in operating segments. To test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both a qualitative assessment and quantitative assessment. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment, we consider operating results as well as circumstances impacting the operations or cash flows of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and reporting unit events and circumstances. For the quantitative test, the assessment is based on both an income-based and market-based valuation approach. If it is determined that an impairment exists, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
Under the income-based approach, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using discounted cash flows that require significant judgement and assumptions, such as our best estimate of future revenue, operating costs, cash flows, expected long-term cash flow growth rates (terminal value growth rates), and risk adjusted discount rates. Under the market-based approach, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by applying those multiples exhibited by comparable publicly traded companies and those multiples paid in acquisitions of peer company transactions to the financial results of the reporting units. We then compare the fair value estimates resulting from the income and market-based valuations to the sum of Griffon’s market capitalization and net debt position to assess the reasonableness of the implied control premium. We determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets by using the relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a trademark by discounting to present value the hypothetical royalty payments that are saved by owning the asset rather than licensing it.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the HBP reporting unit and determined that indicators that the fair value was less than the carrying amount were not present. However, indicators of impairment were present for our CPP reporting units driven by a decrease in comparable company market multiples and an increase in interest rates and the related impact on weighted average cost of capital rates. As such, in connection with the preparation of our
financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the CPP reporting units using both an income-based and market-based approach. The impairment tests resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $342,027. Further, we compared the estimated fair values of the CPP indefinite lived intangibles to their carrying amounts which resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $175,000. A 100-basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an additional impairment charge to our indefinite-lived intangible assets of $34,000.
We performed a qualitative assessment as of September 30, 2021, and 2020, as the estimated fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying amount based on our baseline quantitative assessment, which was performed as of March 31, 2020. Our qualitative assessment determined that indicators that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than the carrying amount were not present. We performed a qualitative assessment as of September 30, 2021, and 2020 considering all the above factors and determined that indefinite-lived intangibles fair values were greater than their book values.
Long-lived assets, such as customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we tested long-lived intangible and tangible assets for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows of each CPP asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group and determined that an impairment did not exist. No event or indicator of impairment existed for the HBP assets groups.
Fair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffon’s stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffon’s control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffon’s reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.
Leases
On October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Codifications ("ASC") Topic 842, Leases, which requires the recording of operating lease Right-of-Use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities. Finance leases were not impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 842, as finance lease liabilities and the corresponding assets were already recorded in the balance sheet under the previous guidance, ASC Topic 840. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification. We also elected a practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term.
The Company applied the modified retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adoption is recognized as of the date of adoption and comparative prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted. As a result, upon adoption, we recognized ROU assets of $163,552 and lease liabilities of $163,676 associated with our operating leases. The standard had no material impact to retained earnings or on our Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. For leases existing as of October 1, 2019, we have elected to use the remaining lease term as of the adoption date in determining the incremental borrowing rate. Our determination of the lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The ROU assets and short and long-term liabilities associated with our operating leases are shown as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities.
For operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases and impaired operating leases, the ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (a "Short-term" lease), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term, and are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable lease cost for both operating and finance leases, if any, is recognized as incurred. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).
Restructuring Reserves
From time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both termination and facility related exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable, they could differ materially from the actual costs.
Income Taxes
Griffon’s effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year, and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, the annual tax rate is refined as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This process often results in changes to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly.
Tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffon’s tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense.
Pension Benefits
Griffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain active and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit
payments. Assumptions used in determining Griffon’s obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffon’s financial position or results of operations.
All of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.
