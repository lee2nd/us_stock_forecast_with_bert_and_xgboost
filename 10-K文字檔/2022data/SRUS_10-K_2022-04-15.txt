ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks.
This Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For this purpose, any statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” or “continue,” or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition from much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop business relationships.
Based on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit totaling $461,354. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Plan of Operation
Stratus Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (“Stratus Capital,” “the Company,” “We," "Us," or “Our”) is a publicly quoted real estate development company seeking to develop or redevelop residential, commercial or mixed-use properties.
On June 1, 2021, Stratus Capital on behalf of itself, its respective heirs, executors, administrators, agents, and assignees, Stratus Summit Trail, LLC, (referred to as “Summit”), the Richard and Reagan Dean Family Partnership, LLLP (referred to as “RRDFPLLLP”) and Denver Digital Hub, LLC (referred to as “DDH”) (collectively referred to herein as the “Party” or “Parties.”) entered into a Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”).
RRDFPLLLP and DDH respectively own seventy-five percent (75%) and twenty-five percent (25%) of the membership interest of Summit (“Interest”) and both of these parties sold their entire Interest or a total of one hundred percent (100%) of the Interest of Summit to Stratus Capital.
Stratus Capital has agreed to acquire the Interest owned by RRDFPLLLP and DDH of Summit of which Summit owns a total of 21 building lots as identified as Exhibit A to the Purchase Agreement within Grand County, town of Fraser, Colorado (“Subject Property”). Stratus Capital agreed that the continuing engineering, architectural or entitlement improvements are to be assigned to Summit if Stratus Capital does not fully pay the Promissory Note (‘the Note’) issued in respect of this transaction as per its terms and provisions as described below.
The purchase price is equal to $60,000 per lot, or 21 lots equal to $1,260,000 adjusted for any site or infrastructure costs as agreed upon by the Parties.
Stratus Capital was to fully pay the Note on or before October 31, 2021, or as agreed by the Parties. This repayment date was subsequently extended to March 30, 2022 and now further to July 30, 2022. As denoted within the Deed of Trust of the Note, RRDFPLLLP and DDH will retain a security interest within the Subject Property until the Note is fully paid per its terms and provisions.
The Closing date shall be 30 days from the date of the Purchase Agreement (unless extended by mutual agreement), title will be provided free and clear with exception of debt assumption and the Note and a special warranty deed is agreed upon by the Parties. Closing of the transaction is formally pending audit of Summit, but Stratus Capital is actively managing the project under a management agreement. The Closing date was subsequently extended to September 30, 2021, then to March 30, 2022, and then now further to July 30, 2022, by mutual consent.
Simultaneously with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Stratus Capital executed and issued a Promissory Note (“Note”) with personal guarantee of Peter Gonzalez, our CEO, (“Gonzalez”) to RRDFPLLLP and DDH as consideration for the Purchase Agreement. The Note is for the principal sum of One Million Two Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars and No/100ths Dollars ($1,260,000.00), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from the date hereof, until paid, at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The Note becomes effective upon the Closing date of the Purchase Agreement.
The Parties also agree that as consideration for services provided within the normal course of business since 2019 or initial acquisition of the Subject Property by Summit, a development fee is due and payable to Willamette Group Trust (“WGT”) equal to $12,500 per lot or $262,500 which is excluded from proceeds due to Seller pursuant to 1(d) of the Purchase Agreement. WGT is a related party, controlled by Stratus Capital principal Gonzalez and WGT agrees that all fees due to itself shall be waived if Stratus Capital does not perform on the terms and provisions of the Note. The agreement with WGT becomes effective upon the Closing date of the Purchase Agreement.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020
We are a publicly quoted real estate development company seeking to develop or redevelop residential, commercial or mixed used properties.
Revenue
We recognized no revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020 as we had no revenue generating activities during these periods.
General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $125,679 comprising officers’ compensation of $36,000, accounting, auditing, legal and share transfer agent fees totaling $82,345 and travel and sundry office expenses of $7,334. During the period ended December 31, 2020, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $126,928 comprising officers’ compensation of $63,000, accounting, auditing, legal and share transfer agent fees totaling $61,416 and sundry office expenses of $2,512.
The decrease of $27,000 in officer’s compensation between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020 arose due to the resignation of one of our directors during the year ended December 31, 2020.
The increase of $20,929 in accounting, auditing, legal and share transfer agent fees was largely due to the increase in fees incurred in 2021 in connection with a proposed fund raising under Regulation A.
Travel cost increased by $4,494 in 2021 as opposed to 2020 and we incurred travel cost in 2021 in connection with our proposed fund raising under Regulation A.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
All companies are required to include a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of their financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of our Financial Statements on page. These policies were selected because they represent the more significant accounting policies and methods that are broadly applied in the preparation of our financial statements.
Inflation
In the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future.
Management will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.
Share-based Compensation
The cost of equity instruments issued to employees and non-employees in return for services rendered is measured by the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation.” The corresponding expense is recorded over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements.
