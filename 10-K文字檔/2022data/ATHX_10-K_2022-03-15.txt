ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company that is focused primarily in the field of regenerative medicine. Our MultiStem® (invimestrocel) cell therapy, a patented and proprietary allogeneic stem cell product, is our lead platform product and is currently in clinical development in several therapeutic and geographic areas. Our most advanced program is an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Our current clinical development programs are focused on treating neurological conditions, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions, cardiovascular disease and other conditions where the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients, particularly in the critical care segment.
Current Programs
Our MultiStem cell therapy product development programs in the clinical development stage include the following:
•Ischemic Stroke: We are conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke, referred to as MASTERS-2. Our MASTERS-2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to enroll 300 patients in the United States and certain other international locations, who have suffered moderate to moderate-severe ischemic stroke. We initiated the study with a limited number of high-enrolling sites and have been bringing on additional sites over time in line with clinical product supply and clinical operations objectives. In prior periods, we have faced challenges to clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and supply interruptions, among other things. As COVID-19 case numbers decline and supply has stabilized, we have undertaken initiatives intended to accelerate new site openings in the U.S. and abroad and increase patient enrollment at sites currently open, including by addressing site-specific operations and inventory management issues. These plans are intended to enable us to finish enrollment of the MASTERS-2 study by the end of 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter; however, completion continues to depend on the impact of the results of the TREASURE study being conducted by HEALIOS K.K., or Healios, discussed below, and the possible resurgence of COVID-19. We would expect, for instance, that favorable TREASURE study results would have a positive effect on site initiations and patient accruals as success drives further interest in and focus on the study among investigators and clinical research groups.
The MASTERS-2 study has received several regulatory distinctions including Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, designation, Fast Track designation and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as well as a Final Scientific Advice positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.
In addition, Healios, our collaborator in Japan, has an ongoing clinical trial, TREASURE, evaluating the safety and efficacy of administration of MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke in Japan. TREASURE will be evaluated under the progressive regulatory framework for regenerative medicine therapies in Japan. Under the new framework, Healios’ ischemic stroke program has been awarded the Sakigake designation by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan, or PMDA, which is designed to expedite regulatory review and approval and is analogous to Fast Track designation from the FDA. In August 2021, Healios reported that it completed patient enrollment in its TREASURE study. In November 2021, Healios announced that, based on the advice of the PMDA, to avoid any potential bias to the 365-day data (and related secondary endpoints) that could result from unblinding and disclosure of 90-day data (primary endpoint), the decision was made that the 90-day unblinding, data analysis and release would take place after the 365-day data is locked. This will follow the last patient’s one-year follow-up visit. Healios expects this last patient visit to occur in March of 2022. We look forward to the completion of both the MASTERS-2 and TREASURE trials and using the accelerated pathways to review and approval afforded to us by the regulators in the United States, Europe and Japan.
•ARDS: In January 2019 and January 2020, we announced summary results and one-year follow up results, respectively, from our exploratory clinical study of the intravenous administration of MultiStem cell therapy to treat patients who are suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, which is referred to as the MUST-ARDS study. The study results continue to demonstrate a predictable and favorable tolerability profile. Importantly, there were lower mortality and a greater number of ventilator-free and ICU-free days in the MultiStem-treated patient group compared to the placebo group. Average quality-of-life outcomes were higher in the MultiStem group compared
to placebo through one year. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2/3 pivotal study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe ARDS, or the MACOVIA study. In September 2020, the MultiStem cell therapy received RMAT designation for the ARDS program. The MACOVIA study features an open-label lead-in followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 portions, and the study is presently designed to enroll up to approximately 400 patients at leading pulmonary critical care centers throughout the United States. During 2021, we amended the protocol with the FDA to adjust the scope of the MACOVIA study to include subject with ARDS induced by pathogens other than COVID-19. Recently, we received approval from the FDA to use MultiStem product manufactured with our bioreactor-based technology in the study, an important development milestone. The scope and timing of our MACOVIA study may be adjusted to reflect rapidly changing standards of care for ARDS patients and depending on regulatory discussions and business considerations. Currently, we are working to complete enrollment of the Phase 2 part of the MACOVIA trial before the end of 2022.
Further, in 2019, Healios initiated the ONE-BRIDGE study in Japan for patients with pneumonia-induced and COVID-induced ARDS and, in August 2021, Healios reported top-line data from the ONE-BRIDGE study. We and Healios have conducted thorough analyses of the data from the MUST-ARDS and ONE-BRIDGE studies. The studies had comparable patient populations receiving the same MultiStem dose amount shortly following an ARDS diagnosis. Between the studies, excluding the COVID-ARDS cohort in the ONE-BRIDGE study, 60 ARDS subjects were enrolled in the studies, 40 receiving MultiStem treatment and the remaining 20 receiving placebo or standard of care. On a pooled basis, strong trends were observed in ventilator-free days, or VFD, survival, improved quality-of-life and reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers. For example, MultiStem-treated subjects had, on average, 5.5 more VFD in the first 28 days following diagnosis than non-treated subjects (p=0.07) and, on a median basis, 10.5 more VFD. Healios continues ongoing consultations with the regulatory authorities to prepare for the potential application for manufacturing and marketing approval.
•Trauma: In April 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the early treatment of traumatic injuries and the subsequent complications that result following severe trauma. The trial is being conducted by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, or UTHealth, at the Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States. This study is being supported under a grant awarded to the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, and the Memorial Hermann Foundation is providing additional funding. We are providing the investigational clinical product for the trial as well as regulatory and operational support.
We are engaged in preclinical development and evaluation of MultiStem cell therapy in other indications for human health, as well as certain indications in the animal health field, and we conduct such work both through our own internal research efforts and through a broad global network of collaborators. We also engage in discussions with third parties about collaborating in the development of MultiStem cell therapy for various programs and/or various geographic territories and may enter into one or more business partnerships to advance these programs over time. We may also elect to develop certain programs independently.
While the MultiStem product platform continues to advance, we are engaged in process development initiatives intended to increase manufacturing scale, reduce production costs and enhance process controls and product quality, among other things. These initiatives are being conducted both internally and outsourced to select contractors, and the related investments are meant to enable us to meet potential commercial demand in the event of eventual regulatory approval. We have been developing a bioreactor-based manufacturing platform for such commercialization, for which we now have FDA approval for use in our ARDS and trauma clinical trials in the United States. Until such time as we are able to manufacture products ourselves in accordance with good manufacturing practices, we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to make our MultiStem product for clinical trials and eventual commercial sales. These third parties may not deliver sufficient quantities of our MultiStem product, manufacture MultiStem product in accordance with specifications, or comply with applicable government regulations. From time to time, such third-party manufacturers, or their material suppliers, may experience production delays, stoppages or interruptions in supply, which may affect the initiation, execution and timing of completion of our and our partners' clinical trials or commercial activities.
In addition to our manufacturing efforts, in other areas we are stepping up our planning and preparations for the potential commercialization of our MultiStem product candidate. We are advancing our strategies for market access and reimbursement, working with third-party experts to plan and undertake initiatives to position the product appropriately and effectively communicate to payors its value to them and patients. We are developing our go-to-market strategies, which could include third-party marketing partners in certain areas and the creation of a commercial sales force in other areas. We are also working with outside experts to develop proprietary solutions to the unique requirements related to the cell therapy supply chain and clinical site logistics. For example, working with an outside partner, we have been developing a proprietary cryogenic system designed to securely store and dispense our product in hospital pharmacies or other suitable clinical locations. Our intention is
to be prepared to enable commercialization as soon as reasonably possible following potential successful completion of pivotal studies, application and approval by regulators.
We have a collaboration with Healios that covers MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke and ARDS in Japan. The collaboration also includes the use of our technology for Healios’ organ bud program targeted to liver disease and other indications, as well as certain other rights, including a license for the use of our MultiStem product to treat certain ophthalmological indications and a license to treat diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas and intestinal tissue through administration of our products in combination with induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSC-derived cells. Under the terms of our various agreements with Healios, we provide manufacturing support services to Healios.
Financial
We have entered into a series of agreements with Healios, our collaborator in Japan and currently our largest stockholder. Under the collaboration that began in 2016, Healios is responsible for the development and commercialization of the MultiStem product for the licensed fields in the licensed territories, and we provide services to Healios for which we are compensated. Each license agreement with Healios has defined economic terms, and we may receive success-based milestone payments, some of which may be subject to credits. In August 2021, we entered into a Comprehensive Framework Agreement for Commercial Manufacturing and Ongoing Support, or the Framework Agreement, with Healios, which provides for resolution of certain issues under the existing agreements between the parties and reframes our collaboration to set the stage for productive efforts as Healios and our collaboration move towards commercialization of MultiStem in Japan. It also provides Healios with deferral of certain milestone payments during the expensive initial commercial launch period. We will be entitled to new milestone payments in the amount of $3.0 million by June 2022 and $5.0 million upon successful completion of certain commercial manufacturing activities. Also, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on net product sales, as defined in the license agreements.
In connection with an equity investment in us made by Healios in 2018, Healios had a warrant, or the 2018 Warrant, to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to a reference price, as defined, but no less than $1.76 per share. In March 2020, Healios exercised the 2018 Warrant in full at $1.76 per share and in April 2020 we received proceeds of approximately $7.0 million in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Warrant. In August 2021, we issued two warrants, or the 2021 Warrants, to Healios in connection with the Framework Agreement, to purchase up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. One of the 2021 Warrants is for the purchase of up to 3,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.80 per share, subject to specified increases, and generally is only exercisable within 60 days of receipt of either conditional or full marketing approval from the PMDA for the intravenous administration of MultiStem to treat patients who are suffering from ARDS. The other 2021 Warrant is for the purchase of up to 7,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $2.40 per share, subject to specified increases, and generally is only exercisable within 60 days of receipt of either conditional or full marketing approval from the PMDA for the intravenous administration of MultiStem to treat patients who are suffering from ischemic stroke.
We have had equity purchase agreements in place since 2011 with Aspire Capital Fund LLC, or Aspire Capital, that provide us the ability to sell shares to Aspire Capital from time-to-time. Currently, we have an agreement with Aspire Capital that was entered into in June 2021, or the 2021 Equity Facility, and includes Aspire Capital's commitment to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of shares of our common stock over a defined timeframe. Our prior $100.0 million equity facility that was entered into in 2019, or the 2019 Equity Facility, was fully utilized and terminated during the third quarter of 2021. The terms of the 2021 Equity Facility are similar to the previous equity facilities with Aspire Capital, and we filed a registration statement for the resale of 40,000,000 shares of our common stock.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we sold 40,031,000, 11,425,000 and 14,475,000 shares, respectively, to Aspire Capital at average prices of $1.61, $1.67 and $1.41 per share, respectively.
Results of Operations
Since our inception, our revenues have consisted of license fees, contract revenues, royalties and milestone payments from our collaborators, and grant proceeds. We have not derived revenue from our commercial sale of therapeutic products to date since we are in clinical development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of external clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing and process development costs, salaries and related personnel costs, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution processes, facility costs, and laboratory supply and reagent costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance our technologies, advance clinical trials of our product candidates, expand our regulatory affairs and product development capabilities, conduct preclinical studies of our product, manufacture our product candidates, improve our manufacturing and process development and prepare for potential commercialization of our MultiStem cell therapy product. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years.
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenues. Revenues increased to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.4 million in 2020. The increase is primarily related to an increase in contract revenues from our collaboration with Healios, which increased $4.1 million period-over-period. Our collaboration revenues fluctuate from period-to-period based on new licenses conferred and the delivery of goods and services under our arrangement with Healios. We expect our collaboration revenues to vary over time as we contract with Healios to perform manufacturing services and as we potentially enter into new collaborations.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses year-over-year of $8.1 million related primarily to increased clinical trial, manufacturing and process development costs of $5.3 million and personnel costs of $3.2 million, including stock-based compensation expense and expense of $0.9 million related to cash retention agreements payable in May 2022. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other research and development costs of $0.4 million. Based on our current clinical development, manufacturing, process development and regulatory affairs plans, we expect our 2022 annual research and development expenses to be higher compared to 2021, and such costs will vary over time based on clinical manufacturing campaigns, the timing and stage of clinical trials underway, manufacturing process development projects and regulatory initiatives. These variations in activity level may also impact our accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses balances from period-to-period. Other than external expenses for our clinical and preclinical programs, we do not track our research expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $20.1 million in 2021 from $15.9 million in 2020. The $4.2 million increase was due primarily to increases in legal expenses incurred in connection with the complaint filed by Dr. Hardy TS Kagimoto against the Company and its settlement, the expenses associated with Dr. Gil Van Bokkelen’s resignation and his separation letter agreement, including $2.4 million of non-cash stock compensation expense and expense of $0.5 million related to cash retention agreements payable in May 2022.
Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased to $1.4 million in 2021 from $0.9 million in 2020 due to additional equipment being placed in service and accelerated depreciation related to certain equipment assets for which the remaining useful life was modified.
Other Income (Expense), net. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.1 million, and other expense, net, was $0.4 million for 2020, and is comprised of interest income and expense and foreign currency gains and losses.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity include our cash balances and equity purchase agreement with Aspire Capital. At December 31, 2021, we had $37.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have primarily financed our operations through business collaborations, grant funding and equity financings, including through our equity facility. We conduct all of our operations through our subsidiary, ABT Holding Company. Consequently, our ability to fund our operations depends on ABT Holding Company’s financial condition and its ability to make dividend payments or other cash distributions to us. There are no restrictions such as government regulations or material contractual arrangements that restrict the ability of ABT Holding Company to make dividend and other payments to us.
We have prepared our consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business. However, we have incurred losses since inception of operations in 1995, have negative operating cash flows, including in each of the last three years, and had an accumulated deficit of $583.3 million at December 31, 2021. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development, clinical and preclinical product development, manufacturing and process development, acquisition and licensing costs, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.
We plan to raise additional capital through the use of our equity purchase agreement with Aspire Capital and, depending on market conditions, through equity offerings. We are also entitled to receive potential milestones payments, subject to certain credits, and royalties from Healios under our licensed programs. Under the Framework Agreement, we are entitled to a new milestone payment in the amount of $3.0 million by June 2022. We receive payments from Healios for certain manufacturing support services. Certain proceeds from Healios may be used by Healios to offset milestone payments that may become due in the future. Additionally, we have the ability to defer certain spending and potentially defer and delay certain non-core programs. While we believe this plan to generate additional funds will alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt, these plans are not entirely within our control and cannot be assessed as being probable of occurring. For the foreseeable future, our ability to continue our operations is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional capital.
We have had equity purchase agreements in place with Aspire Capital since 2011 that provide us the ability to sell shares to Aspire Capital from time to time. Currently, we are party to the 2021 Equity Facility, which includes Aspire Capital's commitment to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of shares of our common stock over a defined timeframe. The terms of the 2021 Equity Facility are similar to the previous equity purchase agreements, and we filed a registration statement for the resale of 40,000,000 shares of our common stock. The 2019 Equity Facility was fully utilized and terminated during the third quarter of 2021, and, during the third and fourth quarter of 2021, we have sold shares to Aspire Capital under the 2021 Equity Facility.
As previously disclosed, under the terms of the 2021 Equity Facility, on any business day on which the closing sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $1.00 per share, or the Floor Price, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a purchase notice, directing Aspire Capital to purchase up to 200,000 shares of our common stock per trading day, provided that the aggregate price of such purchase shall not exceed $500,000 per trading day, up to $100.0 million of our common stock in the aggregate. As our stock price recently has been below the Floor Price and to afford us some flexibility in accessing the 2021 Equity Facility, Aspire has agreed to lower the Floor Price to $0.50, which was the floor price under the 2019 Equity Facility.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we sold 40,031,000 and 11,425,000 shares, respectively, to Aspire Capital at average prices of $1.61 and $1.67 per share, respectively.
We will require substantial additional funding in order to continue our research and product development programs, including clinical trials of our product candidates and process development and manufacturing projects, and to prepare for possible regulatory approval and commercial activities. We have agreements with several contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacture of our MultiStem product candidate to supply our planned and ongoing clinical trials. These agreements represent significant financial commitments, including deposits prior to commencement of manufacturing and progress payments through the course of the manufacturing process.
We intend to meet our short-term liquidity needs with available cash, including available proceeds from our existing equity facility, potential delays in certain non-core programs, and our ability to defer certain spending. Furthermore, we are actively pursuing new collaborative opportunities and other potential sources of funding, which could reduce the current level of usage of our equity facility and potentially accelerate certain costs. If sufficient capital is available, we would plan to accelerate our clinical activity and preparation for regulatory application, approval and commercialization, including commercial manufacturing.
Importantly, we expect that the results of Healios’ TREASURE study, followed by the results of our MASTERS-2 clinical trial, will have a significant impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our ability to access capital from potential third-party commercial partners or the equity capital markets. Depending on the nature of these results, we may accelerate or may delay certain programs. In the longer term, we will have to continue to generate additional capital to meet our needs until we would become cash flow positive as a result of the sales of our clinical products, if they are approved for marketing. Such capital would come from new and existing collaborations and the related license fees, milestones and potential royalties, the sale of equity securities from time to time including through our equity facility, grant-funding opportunities, deferral of certain discretionary costs and the staging of certain development costs, as needed.
Additionally, we may raise capital from time to time through our equity purchase arrangement with Aspire, subject to its volume and price limitations and equity offerings. We also manage our cash by deferring certain discretionary costs and staging certain development costs to extend our operational runway, as needed. Over time, we may consider borrowing from financing institutions or royalty financing arrangements.
Our capital requirements over time depend on a number of factors, including progress in our clinical development programs, preparing for potential commercialization of our product candidates, potential product launch, our clinical and preclinical pipeline of additional opportunities and their stage of development, additional external costs such as payments to contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations, additional personnel costs and the costs in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims. Furthermore, delays in product supply for our clinical trials may impact the timing and cost of such studies, and delays in product supply following Healios’ potential product launch may impact the timing of royalties that we may receive. The availability of funds impacts our ability to advance multiple clinical programs concurrently, and any shortfall in funding could result in our having to delay or curtail research and development efforts. Further, these requirements may change at any time due to technological advances, business development activity or competition from other companies. We cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available to us or, if available, that it will be available on acceptable terms.
We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years and may incur losses in subsequent periods, and our ability to commercialize our product candidates is uncertain. The amount and timing of our future losses are highly uncertain. Our ability to achieve and thereafter sustain profitability will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully developing, commercializing and obtaining regulatory approval or clearances for our technologies and products resulting from these technologies.
Cash Flow Analysis
Net cash used in operating activities was $76.2 million, $61.8 million and $35.3 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented the use of cash to fund operations, clinical trials, preclinical research and process development activities; net of receipts from collaborative arrangements such as Healios. Net cash used in operating activities may fluctuate significantly period-to-period, as it has over the past several years, primarily due to the receipt of collaboration fees and payment of specific clinical trial costs, such as clinical manufacturing campaigns, contract research organization costs and manufacturing process development projects. These variations in activity level may also impact our accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses balances from period-to-period.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the purchase of equipment for our manufacturing and process development activities. We expect that our capital equipment expenditures will increase in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily to support our manufacturing and manufacturing process development needs.
Financing activities provided net cash of $63.4 million in 2021, $79.5 million in 2020, and $19.9 million in 2019. In April 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately $53.7 million, and Healios exercised its 2018 Warrant for which we received proceeds of $7.0 million. In May 2020, we also received $0.5 million from Healios from the issuance of our common stock related to its participation right under the terms of our investor rights agreement with Healios, which was entered into in March 2018 and governs certain of our and Healios’ rights relating to its ownership of our common stock. Financing activities in 2021, 2020 and 2019 also include our equity sales to Aspire Capital and net of shares of common stock retained in exchange for withholding tax payments on share-based awards.
Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates
The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are in management’s view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and demanding of management’s judgement. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following accounting estimates are deemed to be critical to us.
Stock-Based Compensation
We determine the estimated fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected term of stock options granted represent the period of time that stock option grants are expected to be outstanding and subsequent to June 2020, is determined based on our historical experience and patterns. Prior to June 2020, we used the “simplified” method to calculate the expected term of option grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the stock option at the time of the grant. We determine volatility by using our historical stock volatility. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We have never paid or declared dividends or paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of stock compensation expense we recognize related to stock options.
Additionally, stock-based compensation for an award with a performance condition requires the judgement of management. For such awards, stock-based compensation is recognized when the achievement of such performance condition is determined to be probable. If the outcome of such performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met, no compensation expense is recognized.
Refer to Note C, Accounting Policies, for a discussion of our accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards.
CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the timing of initiation of new clinical sites and patient enrollment in our clinical trials, the expected timetable for development of our product candidates, our growth strategy, and our future financial performance, including our operations, economic performance, financial condition, prospects, and other future events.
