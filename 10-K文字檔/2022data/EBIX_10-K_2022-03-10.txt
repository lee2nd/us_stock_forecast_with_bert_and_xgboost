OVERVIEW
Ebix is a leading international supplier of on-demand infrastructure software exchanges and e-commerce services to the insurance, financial, travel, cash remittance and healthcare industries. In the Insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy globally a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis using SaaS enterprise solutions in the areas of CRM, front-end & back-end systems, and outsourced administrative and risk compliance. The Company's products feature fully customizable and scalable on-demand software designed to streamline the way insurance and financial industry professionals manage distribution, marketing, sales, customer service, and accounting activities. The P&C exchanges operate primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. With a "Phygital” strategy that combines over 650,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many ASEAN countries, to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio of software and services encompasses domestic and international money remittance, foreign exchange ("Forex"), travel, pre-paid gift cards, utility payments, and lending and wealth management in India and other primarily Southeast Asian markets. The Company’s Forex Exchange has the leading market share within India’s airport foreign exchange business with operations in 16 international airports, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata International airports, all of which combined conducting over $4.8 billion in gross transaction value annually (pre-COVID-19). EbixCash’s inward remittance business in India conducts gross annual remittance of approximately $5 billion annually (pre-COVID-19) and is the clear market leader. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges, with over 500,000 agents and approximately 18,000 registered corporate clients, combined processing an estimated $2.5 billion in gross merchandise value per annum (pre-COVID-19). Through its various SaaS-based software platforms, Ebix employs thousands of domain-specific technology professionals to provide products, support and consultancy to thousands of customers on six continents. The Company has its global headquarters in Johns Creek, Georgia and also conducts operating activities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.
Ebix provides application software products for the insurance industry, including carrier systems, agency systems and exchanges, as well as custom software development. Approximately 93% of the Company’s revenues are either recurring or repeating (transaction-based) in nature. Rather than license our products in perpetuity, we typically either license them for multiple years with ongoing support revenues or license them on a limited term basis using a subscription hosting or Application Service Provider ("ASP") model. Combined subscription-based and transaction-based revenues of $925 million comprised 93% of the Company's total revenues in 2021, as compared to 88% of total revenues in 2020. In 2021, subscription-based revenues increased by approximately $5 million to $174 million, and as a percentage of the Company's total revenues was 18% in 2021 versus 27% in 2020.
The Company’s technology vision is to converge processes in a manner such that data can seamlessly flow between entities after an initial data entry has been made. Our customers include many of the top insurance and financial sector companies in the world.
The insurance and financial markets continue to focus on initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate improvements in efficiency, both on the back end of transactions as well as at the consumer-involved front end of transaction
processes. This drive for efficiency involves all entities and directly impacts the manner in which insurance and financial products are distributed. Management believes that both the insurance and financial services industries will continue to experience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly the norm across the world insurance and financial markets.
Trends and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, COVID-19 was reported and has spread globally, including to every state in the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the U.S. government declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments implemented travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions, in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions or orders, or the perception that such restrictions or orders could be implemented, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, and the cancellation or postponement of events.
Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We have not experienced a material impact from shifting our employees to a remote work environment, which we primarily attribute to the professionalism of our workforce and our extensive use of technology throughout our business. However, COVID-19 could negatively impact the productivity of our workforce if the pandemic requires prolonged remote working conditions. While in 2021 governments have relaxed travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and similar restrictions, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on the duration and spread of COVID-19 and its variants.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, we experienced a decrease in demand for certain of our solutions and services, particularly those related to the Company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance, e-learning and consulting business areas, after certain government restrictions were implemented. This decreased demand continued throughout 2020 and 2021 in varying degrees for each business area, and even persists through the date of this filing for all of the above mentioned business areas. We expect that demand variability for our products and services will continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict with any certainty when demand for these solutions/services will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.
We continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. Along with the measures mentioned above to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took steps to strengthen our financial position in 2020 to mitigate the adverse impact that COVID-19 has had or may have on our business and operations, including amending our Credit Facility, reducing salaries for certain employees, furloughing employees in the most negatively impacted business areas, eliminating certain employee positions, and eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures. In 2021 we largely returned salaries to pre-COVID-19 levels and, in the case of certain IT professionals, increased wages in reaction to a tightening labor market in India. Additionally, we have ceased our share repurchase program until business conditions improve globally.
Our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2021 may not be reflective of current market conditions, or of our results for any future periods, which may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent than the reported period. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete description of the material risks that the Company currently faces.
Key Performance Indicators
Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor the Company's operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share, and cash provided by operating activities. We monitor these indicators, in conjunction with our corporate governance practices, to ensure efficient management of our business and maintenance of effective controls.
The MD&A discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, but can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on April 27, 2021.
The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020
Operating Revenue
The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to products or services delivered over our exchanges or from our ASP, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects, including fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, as well as foreign exchange, remittance (both inward and outward) and travel services from our financial exchanges.
Ebix’s revenue streams come from three product/service channels. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenues for each of those product/service channels for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
In the table above for the year ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 there are $9.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively, of Insurance Exchange revenues derived in India that are being reported within the EbixCash Exchange channel above. Additionally, for 2021 and 2020, there is approximately $12.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of EbixCash Exchange revenues that are being reported within the Risk Compliance Solutions channel above due to the nature of the revenues (primarily international consulting and BPO revenues within India).
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, our total revenue increased $369.3 million, or 59%, to $994.9 million compared to $625.6 million in 2020. The growth in revenues was due primarily to strong demand for the Company's payment solutions business in India (primarily prepaid gift cards). The Company also experienced year-over-year increases in revenues in international insurance exchange revenues and the EbixCash BPO business, offset, in part, by declines in the COVID-19 affected business areas of travel, remittance, e-learning, financial technologies and global product consulting businesses. The payment solutions revenues increased year-over-year by approximately $374 million year-over-year to approximately $630 million, or 146% year-over-year growth.
The impact from fluctuations of the exchange rates for the foreign currencies in the countries in which we conduct operations also affected reported revenue. During 2021 the change in foreign currency exchange rates increased reported consolidated operating revenue by $3.5 million and in 2020 decreased reported consolidated operating revenue by $(21.9) million. Thus, on a constant currency basis total revenue for the fiscal year 2021 increased approximately 58% year-over-year.
The specific components of our revenue based on our three main business lines and the changes experienced during the past year are discussed immediately below.
Overall Exchange revenues increased $359.3 million, or 64%, as explained below:
•EbixCash Exchange division revenues increased $363.2 million, or 94%, due to continued growth in the EbixCash payment solutions (mostly prepaid gift cards), foreign exchange, and bus exchange businesses, offset by continued COVID-19 impacted revenue decreases within our travel, remittance, financial technology and e-learning businesses. The impact from foreign exchange changes within EbixCash had an immaterial impact on reported revenues.
•Insurance Exchange division revenues decreased by $3.9 million, or 2%, principally due to year-over-year decreased revenues within Life consulting/implementation, CRM, continuing medical education, and the Ebix Health Administration joint venture businesses, offset, in part, by year-over-year increases in revenues within the Company's core Life and Annuity exchanges, Ebix Australia exchange revenue, and Ebix Europe.
•Risk Compliance Solutions division revenues increased by $10.0 million, or 16%, primarily due to an increase in revenues within the EbixCash BPO and Australian broker systems businesses, offset in part by declines in U.S. consulting revenues and year-over-year declines in Ebix Latin America revenues, which are heavily consulting oriented and were negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2021.
International revenue accounted for 84.4% and 73.4% of the Company’s total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Costs of Services Provided
Costs of services provided, which includes costs associated with product sales, customer support, consulting, implementation, and training services, increased $362.1 million, or 105%, from $343.3 million in 2020 to $705.4 million in
2021, and the Company's gross margin decreased to 29.1% in 2021 from 45.1% in 2020. The increase in costs of services provided and the decrease in gross margin from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 is directly related to the increase of over $370 million in revenue within the Company’s payment solutions business (primarily gift card revenue) in fiscal years 2021 versus 2020. Payment solutions gross margins are significantly lower than other solutions and services the Company provides its customers. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the payment solutions gross margins for the Company were approximately 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Excluding the payment solutions business, gross margins for the Company in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were approximately 78% and 76%, respectively. The increase in gross margins, excluding the payment solutions business, in fiscal year 2021 versus 2020 was driven by the revenue mix differences for the Company, with the Company’s highest margin solutions/services (e.g. insurance exchange software and services) experiencing less relative negative impact from COVID-19 during 2021 versus other solutions/services (e.g. travel, remittance, financial technology and e-learning businesses).
Product Development Expenses
The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the development of new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the development of new data exchanges for use in domestic and international insurance markets, as well as the Forex and travel sectors. Product development expenses increased $4.7 million, or 13%, from $35.3 million in 2020 to $40.0 million in 2021. The increase is due to increased personnel costs experienced in India as a result of both returning reduced salaries to pre-COVID-19 levels and inflationary pressures on wages due to a tight labor market for skilled IT professionals in India.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.6 million, or 4%, from $13.8 million in 2020 to $14.4 million in 2021. This increase is primarily due to a reclassification of certain expenses in 2021 that were recorded to general and administrative expenses in 2020 to sales and marketing expenses in 2021, as well as an increase in advertising and marketing expenses to continue to build our EbixCash brand in India and other Southeast Asian markets. The total of these impacts were an increase in year-over-year expenses of approximately $1.2 million, which was offset in part by total personnel costs decreasing by over $0.4 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased $13.4 million, or 15%, from $87.5 million in 2020 to $100.9 million in 2021. In 2020, the Company reduced its acquisition earn-out contingent liability by $3.1 million, which served to reduce overall 2020 G&A expenses. Net of the change in the acquisition earn-out contingent liability, G&A expenses increased by $10.2 million in 2021 versus 2020. This increase was driven by increased personnel costs, including insurance and other benefits, which increased approximately $11 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. Additionally, professional fees increased by approximately $2 million, office-related expenses increased by approximately $1 million, and stock-related compensation increased by approximately $0.6 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. Other items impacting the year-to-year comparison of G&A expenses include a reduction in rent in 2021 versus 2020 of approximately $3.2 million and a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately $4 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 2020 due to reductions in the $12.1 million customer specific accounts receivable reserve recorded in 2019 in regards to receivables that are due from a public sector entity in India as positive collection trends continued in 2021.
Amortization and Depreciation Expenses
Amortization and depreciation expenses increased $1.4 million, or 10%, to $15.2 million in 2021 from $13.7 million in 2020 primarily due to increased fixed asset depreciation (increased capital expenditures over the past two fiscal years as compared to 2019) and increased amortization in 2021 versus 2020 related to definite-lived intangibles resulting from prior acquisition activity, primarily in India.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased $84 thousand, or 50%, from $167 thousand in 2020 to $83 thousand in 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $9.8 million, or 31% from $31.6 million in 2020 to $41.4 million in 2021, primarily due to increased borrowing costs associated with the Company's primary corporate credit facility. The Company's LIBOR spread
increased from 3.50% at the beginning of 2021 to 5.00% in April 2021 as a part of an amendment to the corporate credit facility. The Company also incurred approximately $3.2 million of expenses associated with the 2021 amendments to the corporate credit facility that have been capitalized and increase interest expense as the costs amortize over the remaining life of the credit facility. Finally, the Company paid a commitment fee to the banks equal to 20 basis points on the total facility size on December 31, 2021, which has been recognized as interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the Company’s working capital facilities in India had average balances that were essentially flat year-over-year from 2020 to 2021. These working capital facilities generally carry interest rates of between 9% and 10%.
Foreign Exchange Loss
Net foreign exchange loss of $434 thousand in 2021 which consisted of net losses realized and unrealized upon the settlement of receivables or payables and re-measurement of cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective operating division recording the instrument. In fiscal year 2020, a net foreign currency exchange loss of $387 thousand was recorded.
Income Taxes
The Company recognized income tax expense of $6.6 million in 2021 compared to $5.3 million of income tax expense in 2020, representing an increase of $1.3 million. Our effective tax rate increased to 9.0% in 2021, compared with 5.7% in 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2021 is primarily due to the release of valuation allowance on expired domestic loss carryforwards and greater impact of GILTI related items.
The pre-tax income from and the applicable statutory tax rates in each jurisdiction in which the Company had operations for the year ending December 31, 2021 are as follows:
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities, and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
We intend to continue to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities, in combination with the possible issuance of additional debt or equity, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategic business acquisitions, to retire outstanding indebtedness, and to repurchase shares of our common stock if and as market and operating conditions warrant.
The Company's current corporate credit facility, which is a syndicated credit facility with a group of domestic U.S. banks, will mature on February 5, 2023. Currently, there is $652.3 million borrowed under this credit facility. The Company is in compliance with its covenants as of December 31, 2021. The pending EbixCash initial public offering of common stock ("EbixCash IPO") could provide material proceeds that the Company can use to reduce its outstanding debt. The Company
intends to refinance the credit facility during the fiscal year 2022 with debt and/or equity securities. While there are no assurances that the EbixCash IPO will be executed on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company is likely to evaluate refinancing alternatives in combination with and based on the results of the EbixCash IPO process.
We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash balances and access to the debt and/or equity capital markets, if required, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the general market conditions for debt and equity securities is subject to substantial uncertainty. In the event additional liquidity needs arise, we may raise funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. However, there are no assurances that such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the covenants in our Credit Facility could adversely affect our ability to obtain such financing and our ability to make strategic acquisitions, fund investments, repurchase shares of our common stock or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.
We regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements, including the need for additional debt or equity offerings, when considering potential business acquisitions, or the development of new products or services. During fiscal year 2022, the Company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources to fund organic growth initiatives, strategic business acquisitions, and new product development initiatives and service offerings.
Our cash and cash equivalents were $99.6 million and $105.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in our short-term liquidity position is primarily due to the following factors: (a) reduced net income in 2021 of $68.2 million as compared to $92.4 million in 2020; (b) corporate credit facility term loan repayments in 2021 of $42.6 million versus $20.9 million in 2020; (c) capital expenditures and capitalized software costs of approximately $13.2 million in 2021 as compared to $9.6 million in 2020; (d) increased accounts receivable and receivables from service providers of approximately $7.5 million; (e) changes in other assets, primarily prepaid expenses, of approximately $17.3 million in 2021; and (f) offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $18.5 million, reduction of marketable securities in 2021 of $8.6 million (source of cash) as compared to an increase in marketable securities in 2020 of $21.0 million (use of cash), and a decrease in the cash used for business acquisitions in 2021 ($0) as compared to 2020 ($14.3 million).
Our current ratio decreased from 1.89 at December 31, 2020 to 1.79 at December 31, 2021, and our working capital position decreased to $161.4 million at December 31, 2021 as compared to $170.5 million at the end of 2020. We believe that our ability to generate sustainable robust cash flow from operations will enable the Company to continue to meet its debt obligations and to fund its current liabilities from current assets, including available cash balances.
The Company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions. The free flow of cash from certain countries where we hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions. Furthermore, the repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source and taxation at the U.S. parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts. The approximate cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments balances held in our domestic U.S. operations and each of our foreign subsidiaries as of February 28, 2022 is presented in the table below (figures denominated in thousands):
Business Combinations
The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions in combination with organic growth initiatives as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. The Company looks to acquire businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services.
During the twelve months ending December 31, 2021, the Company did not complete any business acquisitions.
During the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, the Company completed two business acquisition as follows:
Effective May 4, 2020, Ebix acquired from bankruptcy India-based Trimax, which provides IT and integration services to state-owned transport corporations, operates data centers, and is an IT infrastructure solution provider, for approximately $9.9 million of upfront consideration. Additionally, Ebix issued preferred shares in Trimax to the selling shareholders that can be sold five years from the closing of the acquisition based on an independent valuation performed by a Big 4 valuation firm. The maximum value of the preferred shares upon sale is approximately $9.9 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation was finalized during the second quarter of 2021.
On October 1, 2020 the Company acquired a 70% interest in AssureEdge Global Services (“AssureEdge”) for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million, including net working capital acquired. AssureEdge is a pan-India based BPO company, with a variety of BPO offerings via six contact centers across the country. It serves a number of industries and clients that have cross-selling value for EbixCash services. The valuation and purchase price allocation was finalized during the third quarter of 2021.
A significant component of the purchase price consideration for many of the Company's business acquisitions is a potential subsequent cash earn-out payment based on reaching certain specified future revenue targets. The terms for the contingent earn-out payments in most of the Company's business acquisitions typically address the GAAP recognizable revenues achieved by the acquired entity over a one-, two-, and/or three-year period subsequent to the effective date of their acquisition by Ebix. These terms typically establish a minimum threshold revenue target to achieve over the agreed upon period post acquisition to earn the specified cash earn-out payment. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes these potential obligations as contingent liabilities and are reported as such on its consolidated balance sheets. As discussed in more detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, these contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. As of December 31, 2021, the total of these contingent liabilities was $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, the total of these contingent liabilities was $0.
Operating Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated $69.5 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of $30.9
million, or 31%. The major sources and uses of cash provided by our operating activities during 2021 included net income of $68.2 million, adjusted for $1.2 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, $15.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $4.3 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $5.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.3 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, and approximately $(12.2) million of asset/liability changes year-over-year within the operating activities section of the consolidated cash flow statement. The decrease in our operating cash flow in 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in net income year over year of $24.2 million and a change in the cash flow impact of deferred taxes year-over-year from $5.1 million in 2020 versus $(11.1) million in 2021. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities was $(12.2) million in 2021 versus $(19.9) million in 2020. Lastly, the impact on cash flow from operating activities of changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts was $(2.3) million in 2021 versus $1.7 million in 2020.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $100.4 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $39.6 million, or 65%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2020 included net income of $92.4 million, adjusted for $3.6 million of net loss attributable to a noncontrolling interest, $13.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $6.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $6.2 million related to a non-cash intangible impairment loss, $4.8 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.4 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, $(19.9) million of working capital requirements, $(6.5) million of cash used to pay the Miles acquisition earn-out, and $(3.1) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities. The increase in our operating cash flow in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased cash flow from reductions in accounts receivable from trade and service providers as COVID-19 reduced revenues and resulted in comparatively more accounts receivable conversion to cash in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, in 2019 the acquisition earn-out accrual was reduced by $16.5 million (primarily related to the ItzCash acquisition earn-out accrual) as compared to a reduction of the same accrual in 2020 of $3.1 million (primarily related to the Miles and Zillious acquisitions), both of which served to reduce operating cash flow given the non-cash nature of the gains from earn-out adjustments.
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 totaled $4.6 million, primarily related to $7.5 million of capital expenditures to support our operations and $5.7 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold/marketed or used internally, offset in part by $8.6 million provided by a decrease in marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposit).
Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $44.8 million, primarily related to a $21.0 million increase in investment in marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposits), $14.3 million used for acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million of capital expenditures to support our operations, and $4.2 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold/marketed or used internally.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $63.2 million, and primarily consisted of a $10.9 million decrease in the year-end balances in our working capital facilities in India, $42.6 million used to make payments against the Company’s outstanding Credit Facility term loan, $22.6 million of which were scheduled amortization payment, and $9.3 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock.
Net cash used by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $42.0 million, and primarily consisted of a $10.9 million decrease in the year-end balances in our working capital facilities in India, $20.7 million used to make scheduled payments against the Company’s outstanding Credit Facility term loan, and $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock.

Amendment No. 12 provided for, among other things, a waiver of any potential event of default arising under the Credit Facility from the failure to timely deliver the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related compliance certificate for the year ended December 31, 2020, provided that there is no good faith determination by the requisite lenders under the Credit Facility of a "Material Circumstance" (as defined and further described in Amendment No. 12), which determination (if any) may only be made within a specified period described in Amendment No. 12 and is subject to certain cure rights of the Company.
