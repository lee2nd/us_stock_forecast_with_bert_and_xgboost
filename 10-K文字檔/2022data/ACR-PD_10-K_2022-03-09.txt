ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report as that disclosure is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 11, 2021. You are encouraged to reference the discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within that report.
Overview
We are a Maryland corporation and an externally managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate (“CRE”) mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. On July 31, 2020, our management contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc., a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners LLC, by ACRES Capital, LLC (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, “ACRES”), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office and industrial in top United States (“U.S.”) markets (the “ACRES acquisition”). Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its services. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies as well as to maximize long-term stockholder value by maintaining stability through our available liquidity and diversified CRE loan portfolio.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies. Many countries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses, increased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic uncertainty. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets and unemployment rates have stabilized to some degree, due in large part to the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments, the pandemic, exacerbated by virus variants, continues to cause uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, generally, and the commercial real estate industry in particular.
The aforementioned quarantines and travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and their ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2019 and 2020, causing significant increases in our provisions for credit losses. During this height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural options to manage credit risk effectively, including through forbearance and extension provisions or agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we have substantially reversed those provisions due to significant improvements in our current and expected macroeconomic operating environments as well as due to improvements in collateral operating performance and market liquidity.
We continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of the market disruptions caused by COVID-19. However, it is inherently difficult to accurately assess the continuing impact of the pandemic as well as other domestic or global events on our revenues, profitability and financial position. In response, we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity while still growing our loan origination business. We continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and financial position to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment. For additional discussion with respect to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
An important aspect of the ACRES acquisition was that it delivered operational liquidity in order to mitigate additional potential margin call risk as a result of the market volatility that was created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed us to focus on asset management within the portfolio in efforts to restart loan originations and underwriting. Our Manager has and expects to continue to leverage the complementary nature of our lending platforms, its experience and its network of relationships to enhance our new business loan pipeline. Additionally, our Manager continuously monitors for new capital opportunities and executes on agreements that enhance our returns.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 4,600,000 shares of new 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series D Preferred Stock”) for net proceeds of $110.4 million, which includes the underwriting discounts and offering costs. In October 2021, we and our Manager entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Preferred ATM Agreement”) with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, as placement agent (“JonesTrading”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time up to 2.2 million shares of the Series D Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received net proceeds of approximately $194,000 from the issuance of 7,857 shares of Series D Preferred Stock governed by the Preferred ATM Agreement.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued $150.0 million of principal of new 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (“5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes”) for net proceeds of $146.7 million, which includes debt issuance costs. Using the proceeds, we fully redeemed our $50.0 million of principal of 12.00% senior unsecured notes (“12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes”) for $55.3 million, which included a $5.0 million make-whole amount, and partially repurchased $55.7 million of principal of 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (“4.50% Convertible Senior Notes”) during the year ended December 31, 2021. We incurred a loss on extinguishment of $9.0 million, which comprised a $5.0 million make-whole amount on the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes and $4.0 million of acceleration of the unamortized market discounts. We also accelerated the amortization of debt issuance costs of $522,000, which are reflected in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The remaining proceeds from each of these transactions are intended to be used for loan originations and for general corporate purposes in order to improve and grow book value and earnings.
In February 2022, we repurchased $39.8 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes.
We target originating transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $10.0 million and $100.0 million. In March 2020, due to the market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we halted loan originations to manage our liquidity. In conjunction with the capital commitments secured through the ACRES acquisition, we resumed originating floating-rate CRE loans in November 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated 56 floating-rate CRE whole loans with total commitments of $1.5 billion.
We anticipate that our CRE loan originations, CRE debt securitizations and other CRE-related investments during the year ended December 31, 2022 will be between $600.0 million and $1.0 billion.
Our CRE loan portfolio, which had a $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion carrying value at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, comprised:
•
First mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans. These loans are typically secured by first liens on CRE property, including the following property types: multifamily, office, hotel, self-storage, retail, student housing, manufactured housing, industrial, healthcare and mixed-use. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our whole loans had a carrying value of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, or 99.8% and 98.0%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio.
•
Mezzanine debt that is senior to borrower’s equity but is subordinated to other third-party debt. These loans are subordinated CRE loans, usually secured by a pledge of the borrower’s equity ownership in the entity that owns the property or by a second lien mortgage on the property. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our mezzanine loans had a carrying value of $4.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively, or 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio.
•
Preferred equity investments that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and mezzanine debt. These investments may be subject to more credit risk than subordinated debt but provide the potential for higher returns upon a liquidation of the underlying property and are typically structured to provide some credit enhancement differentiating it from the common equity in such investments. At December 31, 2020, our preferred equity investments had a carrying value of $26.0 million, or 1.7% respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our preferred equity investments paid off, generating $28.8 million of proceeds.
We generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our ownership of those assets, including corporate debt.
While the CRE whole loans included in the CRE loan portfolio are substantially composed of floating-rate loans benchmarked to market rates including the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), asset yields are protected through the use of benchmark floors and minimum interest periods that typically range from 12 to 18 months at the time of a loan’s origination. Our benchmark floors provide asset yield protection when the benchmark rate falls below an in-place benchmark floor. Our net investment returns are enhanced by a decline in the cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have benchmark floors. Our net investment returns will be negatively impacted by the rising cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have floors until the benchmark rate is above the benchmark floor, at which point our floating-rate loans and floating-rate liabilities will be match funded, effectively locking in our net interest margin until the benchmark floor rate is activated again or the floating-rate loan is paid off or refinanced. At December 31, 2021, our par-value $1.9 billion floating-rate CRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a benchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.75%. At December 31, 2020, our $1.5 billion CRE loan portfolio, at par, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 1.88%. The decrease in the weighted average benchmark floor was a result of older CRE floating-rate loans with higher floors paying off and being replaced with newer loans with lower floors. If financing rates were increased compared to the conditions at December 31, 2021, net interest margin would be negatively impacted. We expect that as the loan portfolio mix continues to shift toward lower floors, the direct relationship between rising rates and positive net interest margin sensitivity will return by late 2022 to early 2023.

Our portfolio comprised loans with a diverse array of collateral types and locations. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 88.0% and 83.3%, respectively, of our CRE loans were collateralized by multifamily, office, self-storage, manufactured housing and industrial properties, with the remaining 12.0% and 16.7%, respectively, collateralized by hotel and retail properties. These properties are located throughout the U.S., with one National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (“NCREIF”) region in excess of 20% (Southeast at 28.4%) at December 31, 2021 and one NCREIF region in excess of 20% (Mountain at 21.4%) at December 31, 2020 of the total CRE loan portfolio.
Except for three loans, all of our loans were current on contractual payments at December 31, 2021, including one loan performing in accordance with a forbearance agreement. In January 2022, one loan that was delinquent and one loan performing in accordance with a forbearance agreement paid off. Additionally, we have provided relief in the form of term extensions on 14 loans, at a weighted average of 11 months, in exchange for $471,000 of fees during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our CRE mezzanine loan earns interest at a fixed rate.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired properties with a total fair value of $46.4 million through direct equity investments and taking the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a property that formerly collateralized a non-performing CRE whole loan. The existence of net capital loss carryforwards allow for potential future capital gains on these investments to be shielded from income taxes. At December 31, 2021, the total carrying value of our net real estate-related assets and liabilities was $83.3 million on four properties owned.
We use leverage to enhance our returns. The cost of borrowings to finance our investments is a significant part of our expenses. Our net interest income depends on our ability to control these expenses relative to our revenue. Our CRE loans may initially be financed with term facilities, such as CRE loan warehouse financing facilities, in anticipation of their ultimate securitization. We ultimately seek to finance our CRE loans through the use of non-recourse long-term, match-funded CRE debt securitizations.
Our asset-specific borrowings comprised term warehouse financing facilities, CRE debt securitizations and our senior secured financing facility. In May 2021, we closed ACRES Commercial Realty 2021-FL1 Issuer, Ltd. (“ACR 2021-FL1”), a new CRE debt securitization financing $802.6 million of CRE loans with $675.2 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes at a weighted average cost of one-month LIBOR plus 1.49%. Simultaneously, we executed the optional redemption on Exantas Capital Corp. 2019-RSO7, Ltd. (“XAN 2019-RSO7”) and paid off the remaining notes. In December 2021, we closed ACRES Commercial Realty 2021-FL2 Issuer, Ltd. (“ACR 2021-FL2”), a new CRE debt securitization financing $700.0 million of CRE loans with $567.0 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes at a weighted average cost of one-month LIBOR plus 1.80%. Each of these 2021 CLOs provides for a two-year reinvestment period that allows us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and principal paydown proceeds into the securitizations, pending certain eligibility criteria are met and rating agency approval is obtained. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow us to extend the securitizations’ financing lives at favorable interest rates through the reinvestment of loan proceeds into new loans.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding balances on our CRE loan term warehouse financing facilities of $66.8 million and $12.3 million, respectively, or 3.7% and 0.9%, respectively, of total outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding balances of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, on CRE debt securitizations, or 80.8% and 78.8%, respectively, of total outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding borrowings on our senior secured financing facility of $29.3 million, or 2.3% of total outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings on our senior secured financing facility.
In January 2020, we adopted updated accounting guidance that replaced the incurred loss approach with the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model for the determination of our allowance for loan losses. We reevaluate our CECL allowance quarterly, incorporating our current expectations of macroeconomic factors considered in the determination of our CECL reserves. At December 31, 2021, the CECL allowance on our CRE loan portfolio was $8.8 million or 0.5% of our $1.9 billion loan portfolio. At December 31, 2020, the CECL allowance on our CRE loan portfolio was $34.3 million, or 2.2% of our $1.5 billion of our loan portfolio. The CECL model projected significantly increased expected credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the adverse market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a net reversal of credit losses, which reflected improvements in macroeconomic conditions, improved collateral operating performance and improvements in individually-evaluated loans.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded charge-offs of $4.2 million primarily attributable to: (i) the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure of a property formerly-collateralizing a CRE loan with a $2.3 million allowance at the time of transaction in October 2021 and (ii) the November 2021 sale of a CRE loan note for $7.6 million of proceeds, net of costs, with a $1.7 million allowance at the time of sale, including $60,000 of reversing realized gains from the September 30, 2021 allowance.

We historically used derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. In April 2020, we terminated all interest rate hedges in conjunction with the disposition of our financed commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) portfolio. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had unrealized losses in connection with the terminated hedges of $8.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, which will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized amortization expense on these terminated contracts of $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
Common stock book value was $23.87 per share at December 31, 2021, a $3.30 per share, or 16%, increase from December 31, 2020.
Impact of COVID-19
As discussed in the “Overview” above, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to plague countries throughout the globe as virus variants have emerged. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets and unemployment rates have stabilized to some degree, due in large part to the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty on the U.S. and global economies, generally, and the CRE business in particular. The reinstatement of nationwide restrictions placed on businesses in response to COVID-19 may cause significant cash flow disruptions across the economy that may impact our borrowers and their ability to stay current with their debt obligations in the near term. Due to the fluidity of this situation, along with other world events, any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the pandemic on economic and market conditions remains difficult to assess. The continuing impact of the pandemic has had, and we expect may continue to have, a long-term and material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year 2022. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided below in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of Reference Rate Reform
As discussed in the “Overview” section above, our CRE whole loans and our asset-specific borrowings are primarily benchmarked to one-month LIBOR. In March 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve encouraged companies to cease using LIBOR as a benchmark rate by December 31, 2021.
While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated our first whole loan with SOFR as its contractual benchmark rate; and two CRE debt securitizations, Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO8, Ltd. (“XAN 2020-RSO8”) and Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO9, Ltd. (“XAN 2020-RSO9”) transitioned from one-month LIBOR to Compounded SOFR, plus a benchmark adjustment. All of our underwritten loans contain terms that allow for a change to an alternative benchmark rate upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. In September 2021, January 2022 and February 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan Chase”), Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) and Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”), respectively, were amended to allow for the transition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events.
The transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market disruptions and significant increases in benchmark rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. See “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the method for determining the LIBOR or a replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of our loans, investments and borrowings and could affect our results of operations” for additional discussion on the risk related to ongoing reference rate reform.
Results of Operations
Our net income allocable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $18.0 million, or $1.85 per share-basic ($1.85 per share-diluted), as compared to net loss allocable to common shares of $208.1 million, or $(19.33) per share-basic ($(19.33) per share-diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net Interest Income
The following table analyzes the change in interest income and interest expense for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 by changes in volume and changes in rates. The changes attributable to the combined changes in volume and rate have been allocated proportionately, based on absolute values, to the changes due to volume and changes due to rates (dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Percent change is calculated as the net change divided by the respective interest income or interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020.
(2)
Includes increases in fee income of approximately $4.8 million and $19,000 recognized on our floating-rate CRE whole loans and legacy CRE loan, respectively, and a decrease in fee income of $216,000 on our CRE preferred equity investments, that were due to changes in volume.
(3)
Includes the change in interest income recognized on one legacy CRE loan with an amortized cost of $11.5 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, classified as a CRE loan on the consolidated balance sheet.
(4)
Includes a decrease in net accretion income of approximately $616,000 that was due to changes in volume.
(5)
Includes increases of net amortization expense of approximately $5.5 million, $357,000, $33,000, $214,000 and $323,000 on our securitized borrowings, senior secured financing facility, convertible senior notes, 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes and 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes, respectively, and a decrease of approximately $683,000 on our CRE - term warehouse financing facilities, that were due to changes in volume. The increases in amortization expense of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes included $304,000 and $218,000, respectively, of acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs in connection with the repurchase of $55.7 million principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and redemption of all $50.0 million principal amount of 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net Change in Interest Income for the Comparative Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Aggregate interest income decreased by $7.2 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We attribute the change to the following:
CRE whole loans. The increase of $1.4 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to the increases in loan origination fee income of $2.9 million and exit fee income of $1.9 million over the comparative periods primarily related to loan payoffs and paydowns, offset by a decline in the LIBOR benchmark rates of our CRE whole loans, over the comparative periods, which resulted in lower one-month benchmark rate floors on new CRE loans originated.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
CRE preferred equity investments. The decrease of $1.9 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to the payoffs of the preferred equity investments in March 2021 and April 2021.
Securities. The decrease of $6.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to the disposition of our entire CMBS portfolio as of April 2020, except for two CMBS securities retained. In March 2021, the two remaining CMBS securities were sold.
Net Change in Interest Expense for the Comparative Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Aggregate interest expense increased by $3.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We attribute the change to the following:
Securitized borrowings. The total net increase of $4.3 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to the issuances of XAN 2020-RSO8, XAN 2020-RSO9, ACR 2021-FL1, and ACR 2021-FL2 and the acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $1.9 million pertained to the liquidation of XAN 2019-RSO7 in May 2021 and $3.7 million pertained to paydowns of notes on the existing securitizations. The increases were offset by the liquidation of Exantas Capital Corp. 2018-RSO6, Ltd. (“XAN 2018-RSO6”) and XAN 2019-RSO7.
Senior secured financing facility. The increase of $2.0 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to the July 2020 execution and subsequent utilization of the senior secured financing facility.
CRE - term warehouse financing facilities. The decrease of $4.3 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable net payoffs of our CRE term warehouse financing facilities. The net payoffs of our CRE term warehouse facilities were funded by the issuance of our XAN 2020-RSO8, XAN 2020-RSO9, ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 securitizations and the utilization of the senior secured financing facility.
CMBS - short-term repurchase agreements. The decrease of $2.5 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to our CMBS - short term agreements being settled in full as of April 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on real estate securities markets in March 2020. See “Senior Secured Financing Facility, Term Warehouse Financing Facilities and Repurchase Agreements” for additional information.
Convertible senior notes. The decrease of $903,000 is primarily attributable to the repurchase of $55.7 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2021.
5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes. The increase of $3.4 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes in August 2021.
12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes. The increase of $1.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to the execution and concurrent utilization of a portion of the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes in July 2020. In August 2021, the outstanding balance of the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes was redeemed in full.
Unsecured junior subordinated debentures. The net decrease $400,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to a decrease in three-month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate for our unsecured junior subordinated debentures, over the comparative periods.
Hedging. The increase of $289,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to amortization expense on terminated interest rate swaps during the year ended December 31, 2021. In April 2020, in conjunction with the disposition of our CMBS portfolio financed with short-term repurchase agreements, we terminated all interest rate swap contracts hedging that portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net amortization expense, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.

Includes net amortization expense of approximately $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on 22 terminated interest rate swap agreements that were in net loss positions at the time of termination. The remaining net losses, reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets, will be amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the debt.
Real Estate Income and Other Revenue
The following table sets forth information relating to our real estate income and other revenue for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Aggregate real estate income and other revenue increased by $10.5 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We attribute the changes to the following:
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
Real estate income. The increase of $10.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to revenue earned on a hotel property acquired in a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction in November 2020. The property reopened during the first quarter of 2021 and initially earned a significant amount of its revenue from a contract with the U.S. federal government that provided lodging for a group of employees until May 2021. Late in the second quarter and into the third quarter, revenue was driven by increases in occupancy as the economy reopened following the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Total real estate income derived from this property was $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. To a lesser extent, the increase was attributable to rental income on two office properties, one acquired in a direct equity investment October 2021, which earned real estate income of $824,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, and one acquired in a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in October 2021, which earned real estate income of $334,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Operating Expenses
Year Ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
The following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses for the years presented (dollars in thousands):
Aggregate operating expenses decreased by $45.8 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We attribute the changes to the following:
Equity compensation. The decrease of $1.4 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to the acceleration of all unvested stock awards at July 31, 2020 upon the close of the ACRES acquisition.
Real Estate operating expense. The increase of $10.3 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to a full year of operations as owner of a property acquired through the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in November 2020. The property, a hotel in the Northeast region, incurred operating expenses of $8.6 million expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $298,000 of operating expenses during the less than two months of ownership during the year ended December 31, 2020. To a lesser extent, the increase was attributable to the acquisition of two office properties in October 2021, one property that was acquired through a direct equity investment, which incurred operating expenses of $1.3 million during our time of ownership in the year ended December 31, 2021, and one property that was acquired through the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which incurred operating expenses of $727,000 during our time of ownership in the year ended December 31, 2021.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $2.7 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The following table summarizes the information relating to our general and administrative expenses for the years presented (dollars in thousands):
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in professional services during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with legal fees and advisory fees for services rendered as part of the ACRES acquisition. The decrease was also attributable to a decrease in rent and utilities as reimbursable expenses under our Fourth Amended and Restated Management Agreement, as amended (“Management Agreement”) in conjunction with the ACRES acquisition.
(Reversal of) provision for credit losses, net. The reversal of credit losses of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the provision for credit losses of $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 were each attributable to the updated estimates of our CECL model. The CECL model, adopted on January 1, 2020, provides the framework for developing an estimate of the allowance for credit losses using an expected credit losses approach. The CECL model projected significantly increased expected credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the adverse market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our estimated current expected credit losses improved as a result of improvements of macroeconomic conditions, improvements in property-level operations on loan collateral and improvements in individually-evaluated loans.
Other Income (Expense)
Year Ended December 31, 2021 as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
The following table sets forth information relating to our other expense for the years presented (dollars in thousands):
Aggregate other expense decreased $186.0 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We attribute the change to the following:
Net realized and unrealized (loss) gain on investment securities available-for-sale and loans and derivatives. The decrease in losses of $187.5 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to the disposition of our CMBS portfolio that was financed with CMBS short-term repurchase facilities during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in a loss of $180.3 million. We recorded unrealized losses of $6.1 million on two retained securities during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold the remaining two securities for cash proceeds of $3.0 million and recorded gains of $878,000.
Fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale. The decrease of $8.8 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to charges of $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 incurred on the remaining legacy CRE asset held for sale, which included protective advances to cover borrower operating losses of $2.7 million. The remaining asset held for sale was sold in December 2020.
Loss on extinguishment of debt. The increase of $9.0 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to the full redemption of our 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes, which resulted in $7.8 million of losses, and the partial repurchase of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes, which resulted in $1.2 million of non-cash losses in connection with the acceleration of the ratable market discount, during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gain on conversion of real estate. The decrease of $1.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was attributable to the receipt of a deed in lieu of foreclosure on one CRE whole loan with an appraised value of $39.8 million, which was above our loan basis, in November 2020.

The following is a summary of our loans (dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Amounts include unamortized loan origination fees of $13.6 million and $5.7 million and deferred amendment fees of $307,000 and $495,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(2)
Our whole loan portfolio of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion had a weighted-average benchmark rate (“BR”) floor of 0.75% and 1.88% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Benchmark rates comprise one-month LIBOR or one-month Term SOFR. At December 31, 2021, all but one of our floating-rate whole loans had one-month benchmark floors. At December 31, 2020, all whole loans had one-month LIBOR floors.
(3)
Maturity dates exclude contractual extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms that may be available to the borrowers.
(4)
Maturity dates exclude three whole loans, with amortized costs of $27.9 million and $39.7 million, in maturity default at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(5)
Substantially all loans are pledged as collateral under various borrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
(6)
CRE whole loans had $157.6 million and $67.2 million in unfunded loan commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These unfunded loan commitments are advanced as the borrowers formally request additional funding, as permitted under the loan agreement, and any necessary approvals have been obtained.
(7)
The interest rate on our preferred equity investments paid at 8.00%. The remaining interest was deferred until payoff, which occurred in March 2021 and April 2021.
At December 31, 2021, approximately 28.4%, 18.4% and 15.2% of our CRE loan portfolio was concentrated in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, respectively, based on carrying value, as defined by the NCREIF. At December 31, 2020, approximately 21.4%, 17.9% and 16.1% of our CRE loan portfolio was concentrated in the Mountain, Southwest and Southeast regions, respectively, based on carrying value. No single loan or investment represented more than 10% of our total assets and no single investment group generated over 10% of our total revenue.
CMBS. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic produced material and previously unforeseeable liquidity shocks to credit markets. As a result of the receipt of default notices with respect to some of our CMBS and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we disposed of substantially all of our CMBS portfolio as of April 2020. In March 2021, we sold our remaining two CMBS securities with an amortized cost and fair value of $2.1 million for cash proceeds of $3.0 million.

Investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 comprised a 100% interest in the common shares of Resource Capital Trust I (“RCT I”) and RCC Trust II (“RCT II”), respectively, with a value of $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust. We record our investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares as investments in unconsolidated entities using the cost method, recording dividend income when declared by RCT I and RCT II. During years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded dividends from the investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares, reported in other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations, of $65,000 and $76,000, respectively.
Financing Receivables
The following tables show the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
During the year ended December 31, 2020, higher expected unemployment and increased volatility in CRE asset pricing and liquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted assumptions in our CECL estimates and resulted in a net provision for credit losses of $30.8 million. However, the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19 led to a recovery of the global economy and markets worldwide during the year ended December 31, 2021. The ensuing improvements in expected unemployment and macroeconomic conditions, as well as improved collateral operating performance, resulted in a net reversal of expected credit losses of $21.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.
In addition to our general estimate of credit losses, we may also be required to individually evaluate collateral-dependent loans for credit losses if it has determined that foreclosure or sale of the loan or the underlying collateral is probable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of our allowance for credit losses resulted from collateral-dependent loans that were individually evaluated for credit losses, details of which follow:
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we individually evaluated the following loans:
•
An office loan in the East North Central region with a $19.9 million principal balance. We recorded a $2.3 million CECL allowance in the third quarter of 2021 to reflect the as-is appraised value of the property of $17.6 million. Upon receipt of the property in full satisfaction of the loan in the fourth quarter of 2021, we charged off the $2.3 million CECL allowance and recorded the property as a property held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value of $17.6 million.
•
A hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $9.3 million principal balance. We recorded a $1.8 million CECL allowance in the third quarter of 2021 that reflected our estimate of fair value less costs of sale of $7.5 million at September 30, 2021. Upon sale of the loan in November 2021, we received proceeds of $7.6 million, net of costs of sale, and charged off the remaining $1.7 million CECL allowance.
•
A retail loan in the Pacific region with an $11.5 million principal balance. At December 31, 2021, we had a recorded $2.3 million CECL allowance that reflected the loss taken on the loan as a result of a discounted payoff received on the loan in January 2022 in full satisfaction of the loan.
•
A hotel loan in the East North Central region with an $8.4 million principal balance. We received payment in full on this loan in January 2022; and, as such, there was no CECL allowance recorded at December 31, 2021.
•
A hotel in the Northeast region with a $14.0 million principal balance. The hotel has an as-is appraised value in excess of its principal balance, and, as such, had no CECL allowance at December 31, 2021.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we individually evaluated a hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $37.9 million principal balance for which foreclosure was deemed probable. In November 2020, we received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on the property. In conjunction with the receipt of the deed, we obtained an updated appraisal that indicated an as-is appraised value of $39.8 million and consequently reversed the then-outstanding $8.0 million CECL allowance and recorded the property as an investment in real estate on the consolidated balance sheet at its appraised value.
Also at December 31, 2020, we individually evaluated a loan on an office property in the North East Central region with a $19.9 million principal balance and a hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $14.0 million par balance for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. We determined that these loans had CECL allowances of $1.9 million and $0, respectively, calculated as the difference between the as-is appraised values and the loans’ amortized costs.

(Back to Index)
In June 2020, we sold one CRE whole loan note for $17.4 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $1.0 million recorded in the provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Credit quality indicators
Commercial Real Estate Loans
CRE loans are collateralized by a diversified mix of real estate properties and are assessed for credit quality based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten loan-to-collateral value (“LTV”) ratios, loan structure and exit plan. Depending on the loan’s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with the highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing the loans with the lowest credit quality. The factors evaluated provide general criteria to monitor credit migration in our loan portfolio; as such, a loan’s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information received.
The criteria set forth below should be used as general guidelines and, therefore, not every loan will have all of the characteristics described in each category below.
Risk Rating
Risk Characteristics
• Property performance has surpassed underwritten expectations.
• Occupancy is stabilized, the property has had a history of consistently high occupancy, and the property has a diverse and high quality tenant mix.
• Property performance is consistent with underwritten expectations and covenants and performance criteria are being met or exceeded.
• Occupancy is stabilized, near stabilized or is on track with underwriting.
• Property performance lags behind underwritten expectations.
• Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has some tenancy rollover.
• Property performance significantly lags behind underwritten expectations. Performance criteria and loan covenants have required occasional waivers.
• Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of tenancy rollover.
• Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan covenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Expected sale proceeds would not be sufficient to pay off the loan at maturity.
• The property has a material vacancy rate and significant rollover of remaining tenants.
• An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis.
All CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a quarterly basis. Mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments may experience greater credit risks due to their nature as subordinated investments.
For the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, we pool CRE loans based on the underlying collateral property type and utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one year after which we immediately revert to a historical mean loss ratio. In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio, we utilize our full, 15 year underwriting history in the determination of historical losses, along with the market loss history from a selected population from an engaged third-party provider’s database that were similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles.

Loan Portfolios Aging Analysis
The following table presents the CRE loan portfolio aging analysis as of the dates indicated for CRE loans, at amortized cost (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized interest income of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on two loans with principal payments past due greater than 90 days at December 31, 2021.
(2)
Includes one whole loan and two whole loans with total amortized costs of $8.0 million and $28.3 million, respectively, in maturity default at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(3)
The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of $6.1 million and $7.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had three whole loans in maturity default, with total amortized costs of $27.9 million and $39.7 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a property that collateralized a whole loan that was in maturity default at December 31, 2020 with an amortized cost of $19.9 million.
At December 31, 2021, three whole loans, including two loans that had maturity defaults, with a total amortized cost of $30.4 million were past due on interest payments.
In January 2022, two whole loans in maturity default at December 31, 2021 and 2020, including one loan that was past due on interest payments at December 31, 2021, paid off principal of $17.6 million. The payoff on one loan was the result of a discounted payoff and resulted in a realized loss of $2.3 million for which a CECL allowance was established as of December 31, 2021.
Troubled-Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)
There were no TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, two loans underwent TDRs. In November 2020 and October 2021, we received the properties collateralizing both loans that underwent TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2020 through the receipt of the deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure on the properties.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into 14 agreements that extended loans by a weighted average period of 11 months and, in certain cases, modified certain other loan terms. Two formerly forborne borrowers and one borrower performing in accordance with a forbearance agreement were in maturity default at December 31, 2021. No loan modifications during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in TDRs.
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2021, we had restricted cash of $248.4 million, which consisted of $248.1 million held within our seven consolidated securitization entities and $360,000 held in various reserve accounts. At December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $38.4 million, which consisted of $38.4 million held within our six consolidated securitization entities and $33,000 held in various reserve accounts. The increase of $210.0 million was primarily attributable to the close of ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2, executed in May and December 2021, respectively, which hold reinvestment capabilities at the securitization level. ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 held $138.1 million and $99.0 million, respectively, in restricted cash at December 31, 2021. We expect to utilize a significant portion of the restricted cash at ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 to acquire loans or future funding participations for the securitizations’ portfolios, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

(Back to Index)
Accrued Interest Receivable
The following table summarizes our accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
The $1.3 million decrease in accrued interest receivable was primarily attributable to the decrease of $1.2 million in accrued interest receivable from loans, which was primarily attributable to a decline in the weighted average benchmark floors on our CRE whole loans, and the decrease of $56,000 in accrued interest receivable from securities, which was attributable to the sale of our remaining CMBS during the first quarter of 2021. In January 2022, we collected substantially all of the accrued interest receivable from loans.
Other Assets
The following table summarizes our other assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
The decrease of $3.3 million in other assets was primarily attributable to the sale of two fixed-rate CRE whole loans during the year ended December 31, 2021 for cash proceeds of $4.8 million. The decrease in other assets was offset by a $769,000 increase in other receivables in connection with accounts receivable on the operations of a hotel property acquired in November 2020 and two office properties acquired in October 2021 and a $799,000 increase in other prepaid expenses, resulting from the prepayment of property taxes on the aforementioned properties.
Deferred Tax Assets
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net deferred tax asset was zero, resulting from a full valuation allowance of $21.4 million and $21.2 million, respectively, on our gross deferred tax asset as we believed it was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies.
Derivative Instruments
Historically, a significant market risk to us was interest rate risk. We had sought to manage the extent to which net income changes as a result of fluctuation of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings. We sought to mitigate the potential impact on net income (loss) of adverse fluctuations in interest rates incurred on our borrowings by entering into hedging agreements. We classified our interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in the cash flows of a financial asset or liability.
We terminated all of our interest rate swap positions associated with our prior financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At termination, we realized a loss of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a loss of $8.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the debt. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded amortization expense, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an unrealized gain of $347,000 and $438,000, respectively, attributable to two terminated interest rate swaps, in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into earnings over the remaining life of the debt. During years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded accretion income, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $91,000 and $92,000, respectively, to accrete the accumulated other comprehensive income on the terminated swap agreements.
We were exposed to market pricing risks in connection with our fixed-rate CRE whole loans. The increase or decrease of market interest rates caused the fair value of the fixed-rate CRE whole loans to decrease or increase. In order to mitigate this market price risk, we entered into interest rate swap contracts in which we paid a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate benchmark, usually three-month LIBOR. In December 2020, these interest rate swap contracts were terminated.

Senior Secured Financing Facility
On July 31, 2020, our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary (“Holdings”), along with its direct wholly owned subsidiary (the “Borrower”), entered into a $250.0 million Loan and Servicing Agreement (the “MassMutual Loan Agreement”) with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”) and the other lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”). The asset-based revolving loan facility (the “MassMutual Facility”) provided under the MassMutual Loan Agreement will be used to finance our core CRE lending business. The MassMutual Facility has an interest rate of 5.75% per annum payable monthly and matures on July 31, 2027. We paid a commitment fee as well as other reasonable closing costs. The loans under the MassMutual Facility are available for drawing during the first two years of the MassMutual Facility (the “Availability Period”). During the Availability Period, an unused commitment fee of 0.50% per annum (payable monthly) on unused commitments under the MassMutual Loan Agreement is payable for each day on which less than 75% of the total commitment is drawn.
Pursuant to the MassMutual Loan Agreement, the Borrower’s obligations under the MassMutual Loan Agreement are secured by the Borrower’s assets and Holdings’ equity interests in the Borrower, including all distributions, proceeds and profits from Holdings’ interests in the Borrower.
In September 2020, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) the initial portfolio assets were revised and an agreed advance rate for each initial portfolio asset (each, an “Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate”) was set, and (ii) the revolving loan facility under the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended to require the initial lender (currently MassMutual) to provide a specific advance rate for any future eligible portfolio assets and to limit the aggregate total amount of advances outstanding at any time to both the total facility amount and, in lieu of a 55% LTV, a borrowing base as of any required date of determination equal to the sum of, in each case, the product of the advance rate for such eligible portfolio asset (including in respect of the initial portfolio assets, the applicable Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate therefor) and the then determined value of such eligible portfolio asset.
In May 2021, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) Mass Mutual consented to Borrower’s formation of certain subsidiaries to hold real estate and (ii) such subsidiaries agreed to entered into guaranty agreements in favor of the secured parties under the Mass Mutual Loan Agreement.
In connection with the MassMutual Loan Agreement, we entered into a Guaranty (the “MassMutual Guaranty”) among ourselves, Exantas Real Estate Funding 2018-RSO6 Investor, LLC (“RSO6”), Exantas Real Estate Funding 2019-RSO7 Investor, LLC (“RSO7”) and Exantas Real Estate Funding 2020-RSO8 Investor, LLC (“RSO8”), each our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, in favor of the secured parties under the MassMutual Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, RSO6 and RSO7 no longer exist. Pursuant to the MassMutual Guaranty, we fully guaranteed all payments and performance of Holdings and the Borrower under the MassMutual Loan Agreement. Additionally, RSO8 and us, and previously RSO6 and RSO7, made certain representations and warranties and agreed to not incur debt or liens, each subject to certain exceptions, and agreed to provide the Lenders with certain information.
The MassMutual Loan Agreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction.
CRE - Term Warehouse Financing Facilities
In February 2012, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a master repurchase and securities agreement, which was subsequently replaced with an amended and restated master repurchase agreement in July 2018, (the “Wells Fargo Facility”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) to finance the origination of CRE loans. In October 2021, the Wells Fargo Facility matured.
In April 2018, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a master repurchase agreement (the “Barclays Facility”) with Barclays to finance the origination of CRE loans. In connection with the Barclays Facility, we entered into a guaranty agreement (the “Barclays Guaranty”) pursuant to which we fully guaranteed all payments and performance under the Barclays Facility. As of December 31, 2021, there have been two amendments on the Barclays Facility, including the last amendment which extended the revolving period of the facility to October 2022 and modified the guaranty to limit financial covenants to be applicable when there are outstanding transactions. As of December 31, 2021, the Barclays Facility has a maximum facility amount of $250.0 million, charges interest of one-month LIBOR plus a spread between 2.00% and 2.50% and matures in October 2022.

In November 2021, our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a $250.0 million Master Repurchase and Securities Contract Agreement with Morgan Stanley, to be used to finance our commercial real estate lending business (the “Morgan Stanley Facility”). Each repurchase transaction will specify its own terms, such as identification of the assets subject to the transaction, sale price, repurchase price and rate. The financing provided by the Morgan Stanley Facility matures in November 2022, with two one-year automatic extensions unless notice of intent not to extend the facility is provided. We also have the right to request an extension for an additional one-year period after the second automatic extension to the extent it is utilized.
CMBS - Short-Term Repurchase Agreements
The COVID-19 pandemic produced material and previously unforeseeable liquidity shocks in credit markets causing significant declines in the pricing of our investment securities available-for-sale that were collateral for our CMBS short-term repurchase facilities. As a result, in March 2020, we received written notices from RBC Capital Markets, LLC, RBC (Barbados) Trading Bank Corporation and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. alleging that events of default had occurred under our associated repurchase agreements as a result of not meeting certain margin calls. These notices were subsequently either withdrawn or rescinded. We had no outstanding balances on our CMBS - short-term repurchase agreements at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, we retain equity in the following securitizations (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
The permitted funded companion participation period is the period in which principal repayments can be utilized to purchase loans held outside of the respective securitization that represent the funded commitments of existing collateral in the respective securitization that were not funded as of the date the respective securitization was closed.

Corporate Debt
4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes
We issued $100.0 million aggregate principal of our 8.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 (“8.00% Convertible Senior Notes”) and $143.8 million aggregate principal of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in January 2015 and August 2017, respectively (together, the “Convertible Senior Notes”). In conjunction with the issuance of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes, we extinguished $78.8 million aggregate principal of our 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes. In January 2020, the remaining 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes were paid off upon maturity.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $55.7 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes, resulting in a charge to earnings of $1.5 million, comprising an extinguishment of debt charge of $1.2 million in connection with the acceleration of the market discount and interest expense of $304,000 in connection with the acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs. In February 2022, we repurchased $39.8 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes.
The following table summarizes the Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except the conversion prices and amounts in the footnotes):
(1)
Includes the amortization of the market discounts and deferred debt issuance costs, if any, for the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
(2)
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 the effective interest rate for the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes was 7.43%.
(3)
Represents the number of shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes’ principal outstanding, subject to adjustment as provided in the Third Supplemental Indenture (the “4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture”).
(4)
The conversion rate and conversion price of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2021 are adjusted to reflect quarterly cash dividends in excess of a $0.30 dividend threshold, as defined in the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture.
The 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time up until one business day before the maturity date and may be settled in cash, our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock, at our election. The closing price of our common stock was $12.47 on December 31, 2021, which did not exceed the conversion price of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2021.
Unsecured Junior Subordinated Debentures
During 2006, we formed RCT I and RCT II for the sole purpose of issuing and selling capital securities representing preferred beneficial interests. RCT I and RCT II are not consolidated into our consolidated financial statements because we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. In connection with the issuance and sale of the capital securities, we issued junior subordinated debentures to RCT I and RCT II of $25.8 million each, representing our maximum exposure to loss. The debt issuance costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures for RCT I and RCT II were included in borrowings and were amortized into interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations using the effective yield method over a ten year period.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
There were no unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures for RCT I and RCT II outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The interest rates for RCT I and RCT II, at December 31, 2021, were 4.17% and 4.08%, respectively. The interest rates for RCT I and RCT II, at December 31, 2020, were 4.19% and 4.16%, respectively.
The rights of holders of common securities of RCT I and RCT II are subordinate to the rights of the holders of capital securities only in the event of a default; otherwise, the common securities’ economic and voting rights are pari passu with the capital securities. The capital and common securities of RCT I and RCT II are subject to mandatory redemption upon the maturity or call of the junior subordinated debentures held by each. Unless earlier dissolved, RCT I will dissolve in May 2041 and RCT II will dissolve in September 2041. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of RCT I and RCT II, which mature in June 2036 and October 2036, respectively, and may currently be called at par.
Senior Unsecured Notes
5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2026
On August 16, 2021, we issued $150.0 million of our 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes pursuant to our Indenture, dated August 16, 2021 (the “Base Indenture”), between Wells Fargo, now Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“CTC”), as trustee (the “Trustee”), and us as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated August 16, 2021, between Wells Fargo, now CTC, and us (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”). Prior to May 15, 2026, we may at our option redeem the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, and (ii) a make-whole premium. On or after May 15, 2026, we may at our option redeem the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes, at any time, in whole or in part, on not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
The Indenture contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain certain financial ratios. The foregoing limitations are subject to exceptions as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with these covenants. The Indenture provides for customary events of default that include, among other things (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods): (i) non-payment of principal or interest, (ii) breach of certain covenants contained in the Indenture or the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes, (iii) an event of default or acceleration of certain other indebtedness of ours or a subsidiary in which we have invested at least $75 million in capital within the applicable grace period and (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs (subject to certain exceptions), CTC or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes may declare all of the notes to be due and payable.
12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes
On July 31, 2020, we entered into the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) and MassMutual pursuant to which we may issue to Oaktree and MassMutual from time to time up to $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes. The 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes had an annual interest rate of 12.00%, payable up to 3.25% (at our election) as pay-in-kind interest and the remainder as cash interest.

In addition, on July 31, 2020, we issued to MassMutual $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes. At any time and from time to time prior to January 31, 2022, we may elect to issue to Oaktree and MassMutual up to $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes.
On August 18, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Oaktree and MassMutual that provided for the redemption in full of the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes, including a waiver of certain sections of the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement. On August 20, 2021, the redemption was consummated and a payment to Oaktree and MassMutual was made for an aggregate $55.3 million, which consisted of (i) principal in the amount of $50.0 million, (ii) interest in the amount of approximately $329,000 and (iii) a make-whole amount of approximately $5.0 million. In connection with the redemption, we recorded a charge to earnings of $8.0 million, comprising an extinguishment of debt charge of $7.8 million in connection with (i) the $5.0 million net make-whole amount and (ii) the $2.8 million acceleration of the remaining market discount; and interest expense of $218,000 in connection with the acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs.
In January 2022, we entered into an amendment of the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement that extended the time to July 2022 that we may elect to issue to Oaktree and MassMutual up to $75.0 million of principal of additional notes. At any time and from time to time prior to July 31, 2022, we may elect to issue to Oaktree and MassMutual warrants to purchase an additional 699,992 shares of the common stock for a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes being issued. The warrants are immediately exercisable on issuance and expire seven years from the issuance date. The warrants can be exercised with cash or as a net exercise.

Stockholders’ Equity
Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $448.2 million and gave effect to $8.1 million of net unrealized losses on our terminated cash flow hedges, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $334.4 million and gave effect to $10.0 million of unrealized gains on our terminated cash flow hedges shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in stockholders’ equity during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $110.4 million pertaining to the Series D Preferred Stock offering, net of offering costs of $4.6 million, as well as net proceeds of approximately $194,000 from the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock under the Preferred ATM Agreement with JonesTrading and an increase in retained earnings in connection with an increase in net income offset by common stock repurchases.
Balance Sheet - Book Value Reconciliation
The following table rolls forward our common stock book value for the three months and year ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data and amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Per share calculations and share amounts in the above table and the following tabular footnotes retrospectively reflect the three-for-one reverse stock split effective February 16, 2021.
(2)
Per share calculations exclude unvested restricted stock, as disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet, of 333,329, 333,329 and 11,610 shares at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and include warrants to purchase up to 466,661 shares of common stock at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The denominators for the calculation were 9,282,411, 9,556,940 and 10,617,340 at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.
(3)
The per share amounts are calculated with the denominator referenced in footnote (2) at December 31, 2021. We calculated net income per common share-diluted of $0.76 and $1.85 using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
(4)
Our Board authorized and approved the continued use of the share repurchase program to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the currently outstanding common stock through June 30, 2021 or until the authorized $20.0 million is fully deployed. We completed the share repurchase program in July 2021. In November 2021, our Board authorized and approved the continued use of our existing share repurchase program to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock. We purchased 274,529 shares for $3.7 million through December 31, 2021.
(5)
We calculated common stock book value as total stockholders’ equity of $448.2 million less preferred stock equity of $226.6 million at December 31, 2021.
Management Agreement Equity
Our monthly base management fee, as defined in our Management Agreement, is equal to the greater of (i) 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50% or (ii) $442,000 through July 31, 2022 and is calculated and paid monthly in arrears.
The following table summarizes the calculation of equity, as defined in the Management Agreement (in thousands):
(1)
Deducts underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses and costs relating to such issuances.
(2)
Excludes non-cash equity compensation expense incurred to date.
Core Earnings
Core Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our operating performance.
Core Earnings exclude the effects of certain transactions and adjustments in accordance with GAAP that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. Core Earnings exclude income (loss) from all non-core assets such as commercial finance, middle market lending, residential mortgage lending, certain legacy CRE assets and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date of December 31, 2016.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
Core Earnings, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shares, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for credit losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (1) (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. Core Earnings may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items.
Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate incentive compensation using Core Earnings that exclude incentive compensation payable to our Manager, we include incentive compensation payable to our Manager in calculating Core Earnings for reporting purposes.
The following table provides a reconciliation from GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shares to Core Earnings allocable to common shares for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and amounts in the footnotes):
(1)
In March 2021, the CMBS portfolio was sold for $3.0 million, representing a total realized loss of $5.2 million that was included in Core Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021. Unrealized (gain) loss on core activities includes the unrealized gains and losses on the residual CMBS portfolio, which were previously excluded from Core Earnings.
(2)
In November 2021, one CRE loan was sold for proceeds, net of costs, of $7.6 million, representing a total realized loss of $1.7 million that was included in Core Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021.
(3)
In November 2020, we received property through the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on one CRE whole loan. At the time of receipt, the property had an appraised value of $39.8 million, which was above our loan basis, resulting in a gain on conversion of $1.6 million.
(4)
Non-core assets are investments and securities owned by us at the initial measurement date in (i) commercial finance, (ii) middle market lending, (iii) residential mortgage lending, (iv) legacy CRE loans designated as held for sale and (v) other non-CRE assets included in assets held for sale.
(5)
Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, reported during the year ended December 31, 2020 was reclassified into net income from non-core assets to conform to the 2021 presentation.
Core Earnings in accordance with the Management Agreement, which excludes incentive compensation payable, was $2.1 million, or $0.22 per common share outstanding, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. There was no incentive compensation payable for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Incentive Compensation Hurdle
In accordance with the Management Agreement, incentive compensation is earned by our Manager when our Core Earnings per common share (as defined in the Management Agreement) for such quarter exceeds an amount equal to: (1) the weighted average of (a) book value (as defined in the Management Agreement) as of the end of such quarter divided by 10,293,783 shares and (b) the price per share (including the conversion price, if applicable) paid for common shares in each offering (or issuance, upon the conversion of convertible securities) by us subsequent to September 30, 2017, in each case at the time of issuance, multiplied by (2) the greater of (a) 1.75% and (b) 0.4375% plus one-fourth of the ten year treasury rate, as defined in the Management Agreement, for such quarter (the “Incentive Compensation Hurdle”).
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our Core Earnings, as defined in the Management Agreement, did not exceed the Incentive Compensation Hurdle.
Commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2022, incentive compensation will be calculated and payable in arrears in an amount, not less than zero, equal to:
(i)
for the first full calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) our Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement) for such calendar quarter, over (ii) the product of (A) our book value equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) as of the end of such calendar quarter, and (B) 7% per annum;
(ii)
for each of the second, third and fourth full calendar quarters following the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the excess of (1) the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) our Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement) for the calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, over (ii) the product of (A) our book value equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) in the calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, and (B) 7% per annum, over (2) the sum of any incentive compensation paid to our Manager with respect to the prior calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022 (other than the most recent calendar quarter); and
(iii)
for each calendar quarter thereafter, the excess of (1) the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) our Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement) for the previous 12-month period, over (ii) the product of (A) our book value equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) in the previous 12-month period, and (B) 7% per annum, over (2) the sum of any incentive compensation paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive compensation shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement) for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters from September 30, 2022) in the aggregate is greater than zero.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay dividends, fund investments, repay borrowings and provide for other general business needs, including payment of our base management fee and incentive compensation. Our ability to meet our on-going liquidity needs is subject to our ability to generate cash from operating activities and our ability to maintain and/or obtain additional debt financing and equity capital together with the funds referred to below.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were: (i) gross proceeds of $862.2 million from our CRE - term warehouse financing facilities, (ii) proceeds of $326.8 million from CRE whole loan purchases by our managed CRE securitizations ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2, (iii) net proceeds of $173.4 million from repayments on our CRE portfolio, (iv) net proceeds of $146.7 million from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes, (v) net proceeds of $110.6 million from the completion of the Series D Preferred Stock offering and issuances, (vi) net proceeds of $43.3 million at the close of ACR 2021-FL1, (vii) proceeds of $17.9 million from our CRE securitizations that used principal paydowns to purchase CRE loan future funding commitments, and (viii) combined proceeds of $15.4 million from the sale of a CRE whole loan, investment securities available-for-sale and fixed-rate CRE whole loans. These sources of liquidity were offset by our deployments in CRE whole loans and real estate investments, the partial repurchase and extinguishment of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes, the redemption of our 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes, repurchases of common stock, distributions on our preferred stock and ongoing operating expenses and substantially resulted in the $35.5 million of unrestricted cash we held at December 31, 2021.
In October 2021, we entered into the Preferred ATM Agreement with our Manager and with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, as placement agent, pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time up to 2.2 million shares of the Series D Preferred Stock.
In November 2021, our Board authorized and approved the continued use of our existing share repurchase program to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
In January 2022, we entered into an amendment with Oaktree and MassMutual whereby we can issue up to $75.0 million of principal on 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes through July 2022.
The outstanding balance of our loan to ACRES Capital Corp., the parent of our Manager, was $11.6 million and $11.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The note bears interest at 3.00% per annum, payable monthly, and matures in July 2026, subject to two one-year extensions, at ACRES Capital Corp.’s option, and amortizes at a rate of $25,000 per month.

We utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize the following three types of financing arrangements:
1.
Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans that we own. During an initial revolving period, additional loans may be financed on the senior secured financing facility. After the revolving period, the senior secured financing facility transitions to a term period over the remaining life of the facility. We pay a fixed rate of interest on the senior secured financing facility as well as an unfunded commitment fee when the facility has borrowings below a certain threshold as a percentage of the total commitment.
2.
Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans): Term warehouse financing facilities effectively allow us to borrow against loans that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same loans from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised collateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the counterparty.
3.
Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question.
The issuances of ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 include 24-month reinvestment periods ending in May 2023 and December 2023, respectively, that allow us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and paydowns into the securitizations upon the satisfaction of certain eligibility and reinvestment criteria along with rating agency approval. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow us to extend the securitizations’ financing capability by increasing the useful lives of the senior notes through the reinvestment of loan proceeds into new loans. We are also able to acquire future funding participations of the collateral in the securitizations during the reinvestment period.
Additionally, ACR 2021-FL2 includes a 180-day ramp-up acquisition period during which unused proceeds at close can be used to acquire CRE loans that meet specified criteria for its portfolio. As of February 28, 2022, $180.7 million of the proceeds had been utilized to acquire additional loan collateral for the securitization.
We were in compliance with all of our covenants at December 31, 2021 in accordance with the terms provided in agreements with our lenders.
We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us, the borrowers underlying our commercial real estate-related loans (and their tenants), our financing sources, and the economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’s impact on our operations and liquidity remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further discussion of the potential impacts on us from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in the section entitled “Risk Factors-Impact of Current Economic Conditions” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2021, we had a senior secured financing facility and term warehouse financing facilities as summarized below (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Facility principal outstanding excludes deferred debt issuance costs of $3.4 million at December 31, 2021.
(2)
Facilities principal outstanding excludes accrued interest payable of $58,000 and deferred debt issuance costs and discounts of $4.3 million at December 31, 2021.
The following table summarizes the average principal outstanding on our senior secured financing facility and term warehouse financing facilities during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the principal outstanding on our senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and short-term repurchase agreements at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Excludes accrued interest payable on the senior secured financing facility collateralized by CRE loans of $26,000 and $75,000 and deferred debt issuance costs of $3.4 million and $4.0 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2)
Excludes accrued interest payable on term warehouse financing facilities collateralized by CRE loans of $58,000 and $16,000 and deferred debt issuance costs and discounts of $4.3 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following table summarizes the maximum month-end principal outstanding on our senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and short-term repurchase agreements during the periods presented (in thousands, except amount in footnotes):

During the year ended December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds of: (i) proceeds of $128.5 million of financing sourced from our senior secured financing facility, (ii) net proceeds of $99.5 million from our CRE - term warehouse financing facilities, (iii) net proceeds of $89.1 million from repayments on our CRE loan portfolio, (iv) proceeds of $50.0 million from the issuance of the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes, (v) net proceeds of $47.3 million from the close of XAN 2020-RSO8 and XAN 2020-RSO9, (vi) net proceeds of $27.7 million from the sales of one CRE whole loan and one CRE asset held for sale, and (vii) proceeds of $21.4 million from our CRE securitizations that used principal paydowns to invest in CRE loan future funding commitments. These sources of liquidity, offset by the liquidation of XAN 2018-RSO6, paydowns on our CRE term warehouse facilities, elective paydowns on our senior secured financing facility, pay off of our 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes, margin calls received, net settlements on CMBS repurchase agreements, deployments in CRE debt investments, repurchases of common stock, distributions on our common and preferred stock and ongoing operating expenses, substantially resulted in the $29.4 million of unrestricted cash we held at December 31, 2020.
Historically, we financed the acquisition of our investments through CDOs and securitizations that essentially match the maturity and repricing dates of these financing vehicles with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments. In the past, we have derived substantial operating cash from our equity investments in our CDOs and securitizations, which will cease if the CDOs and securitizations fail to meet certain tests. Through December 31, 2021, we did not experience difficulty in maintaining our existing CDO and securitization financing and passed all of the critical tests required by these financings.
The following table sets forth the distributions received by us and coverage test summaries for our active securitizations at the periods presented (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Overcollateralization cushion represents the amount by which the collateral held by the securitization issuer exceeds the minimum amount required.
(2)
The reinvestment period is the period in which principal proceeds received may be used to acquire new CRE loans or the funded commitments of existing collateral for reinvestment into the securitization.
(3)
The permitted funded companion participation period for XAN 2020-RSO8, ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 is the period in which principal repayments can be utilized to purchase loans held outside of the respective securitization that represent the funded commitments of existing collateral in the respective securitization that were not funded as of the date the respective securitization was closed. Additionally, the indenture for each securitization does not contain any interest coverage test provisions.
(4)
XAN 2020-RSO9 includes a future advances reserve account, which had a balance of $7.4 million at December 31, 2021, to fund commitments that were not funded as of the closing date. Additionally, the indenture does not contain any interest coverage test provisions.
(5)
Includes a 180-day ramp up acquisition period that allows the securitization to acquire CRE loans using unused proceeds of $98.9 million at December 31, 2021 from the issuance of the non-recourse floating-rate notes.
The following table sets forth the distributions made by and liquidation details for our liquidated securitizations for the periods presented (in thousands):
(1)
The remaining assets at the liquidation date were distributed to us in exchange for our notes owned and preference shares in the respective securitization.

At February 28, 2022 our liquidity consisted of $77.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $65.2 million of unlevered financeable CRE loans and $75.0 million of availability under the Oaktree and MassMutual 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes.
Our leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of borrowings to stockholders’ equity, may vary as a result of the various funding strategies we use. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our leverage ratio under GAAP was 4.0 and 3.9 times, respectively. The leverage ratio increase through December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to the increase in CRE debt securitization borrowings in connection with net loan production during the year and an increase in corporate borrowings in connection with the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes, the proceeds of which were partially used to pay off the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes and partially repurchase the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. The impact to our leverage ratio from the increase in borrowings was offset by the issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2021, which was the primary driver of a net increase in our stockholders’ equity of $113.8 million.
Net Operating Loss and Capital Loss Carryforwards
We generated approximately $47.7 million of net operating losses (“NOL”) during the tax year ended December 31, 2020. This was reported on our tax return that was finalized and filed in October 2021. This amount can generally be carried forward to offset both ordinary taxable income and capital gains in future years. Additionally, we estimate that we will generate approximately $14.8 million of operating losses in 2021 and 2022. These amounts will offset taxable income in the year they occur, and any excess will be carried forward as additional NOL. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) along with revisions made by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES”) reduced the deduction for NOLs to 80% of taxable income and granted an indefinite carryforward period.
In addition to NOLs, we generated approximately $136.9 million of net capital losses as of December 31, 2020. A net capital loss may be carried forward up to five years to offset future capital gains.
We also generate tax assets in our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). These tax assets are analyzed and disclosed quarterly in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, our TRSs have approximately $39.9 million of pre-TCJA NOLs, some of which are set to expire beginning in 2044. The TRSs also have approximately $20.3 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward period and net capital losses of approximately $969,000.
We are exploring a range of assets and options in which to invest, including investments in commercial real estate equity, with the objective of creating capital gains to take advantage of all or a portion of our collective capital loss carryforwards.
Distributions
We did not pay distributions on our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2020 as we were focused on prudently retaining and managing sufficient excess liquidity in connection with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of losses during that year, we received significant NOL carryforwards, which are expected to grow in 2021 and 2022, and net capital loss carryforwards, as finalized in our 2020 tax return. Therefore, we did not pay, nor were we required to pay, distributions on our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2021.We intend to retain taxable income by utilizing our NOL carryforwards and expect to generate capital gains to use a portion of our net capital loss carryforwards, thereby growing book value and our investable equity base. As we continue to take steps necessary to stabilize our core earnings, our Board will establish a plan for the prudent resumption of the payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions as such distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board deems relevant.
We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our preferred stock.
U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions, or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
(1)
Contractual commitments exclude $26,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2021 on our senior secured financing facility.
(2)
Contractual commitments include $58,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2021 on our term warehouse financing facilities.
(3)
Contractual commitments exclude $3.1 million of interest expense payable through maturity, in August 2022, on our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes, which incorporates the impact of the repurchase of $39.8 million of principal on the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in February 2022.
(4)
Contractual commitments exclude $43.1 million of interest expense payable through maturity, in August 2026, on our 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes.
(5)
Contractual commitments exclude $22.8 million and $23.6 million of estimated interest expense payable through maturity, in June 2036 and October 2036, respectively, on our trust preferred securities.
(6)
Unfunded commitments on our originated CRE whole loans generally fall into two categories: (i) pre-approved capital improvement projects and (ii) new or additional construction costs subject, in each case, to the borrower meeting specified criteria. Upon completion of the improvements or construction, we would receive additional interest income on the advanced amount. At December 31, 2021, we had unfunded commitments on 67 CRE whole loans. At December 31, 2021, XAN 2020-RSO9 includes a future advances reserve account of $7.4 million to fund unfunded commitments.
(7)
Base management fees presented are based on an estimate of base management fees payable to our Manager over the next 12 months. Our Management Agreement also provides for an incentive compensation arrangement that is based on operating performance. The incentive compensation is not a fixed and determinable amount, and therefore it is not included in this table.
We expect to fully redeem the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in cash upon maturity on August 15, 2022. At February 28, 2022, the outstanding principal balance was $48.2 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
General
At December 31, 2021, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or contractually narrow or limited purposes, although we do have interests in unconsolidated entities not established for those purposes. Except as set forth below, at December 31, 2021, we had not guaranteed obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or letter of intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.
Unfunded CRE Loan Commitments
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to borrowers whose loans are in our CRE loan portfolio to provide additional loan funding in the future. Disbursement of funds pursuant to these commitments is subject to the borrower meeting pre-specified criteria. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting requirements and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial investments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Whole loans had $157.6 million and $67.2 million in unfunded loan commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Preferred equity investments had $2.5 million in unfunded investment commitments at December 31, 2020. The preferred equity investments paid off during the year ended December 31, 2021. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable.
Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees and indemnifications that contingently obligate us to make payments to the guaranteed or indemnified party based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed or indemnified party. As such, we may be obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform or achieve specified performance criteria, or we may have an indirect guarantee of the indebtedness of others.

As part of our May 2017 sale of our equity interest in Pearlmark Mezz, we entered into an indemnification agreement whereby we indemnified the purchaser against realized losses of up to $4.3 million on one mezzanine loan until its final maturity date in 2020. As a result of the indemnified party’s partial sale of the mezzanine loan, our maximum exposure was reduced to $536,000 in 2019. In October 2020, the mezzanine loan paid off its balance to the indemnified party, resulting in the extinguishment of our liability.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by management in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and our financial results. We believe that certain of our policies are critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The critical policies summarized below relate to valuation of investment securities, accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, income taxes, allowance for credit losses and variable interest entities (“VIEs”). We have reviewed these accounting policies with our Board and believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at the time.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit loss on our loans held for investment. CRE loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable. Effective January 1, 2020, we determine our allowance for credit losses, consistent with GAAP, by measuring CECL on the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. We utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which we revert to the historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach sourced from our own historical losses and the market losses from an engaged third party’s database, to be applied for the remaining estimable period. The CECL model requires us to make significant judgements, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for the amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and prepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by us.
We measure the loan portfolio’s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, which is typically based on the loan’s collateral type. We regularly evaluate the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio to determine whether a different pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if we determine that foreclosure of a loan’s collateral is probable or repayment of the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. Fair value may be determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; or (iii) the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs.
While a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at such time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan becomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of the credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan’s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value for such loan. While on non-accrual status, we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit analysis supports the borrower’s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued interest is reversed from interest income.
We utilize the contractual life of our loans to estimate the period over which we measure expected credit losses. Estimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for our CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification in connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan’s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) concurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that eased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR if the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measurement of the impact of TDRs on the expected credit losses occurs when a TDR is reasonably expected. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis, then we will individually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow method.
In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, we utilize historical losses from our full underwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party’s database that are similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles. We may make adjustments to the historical loss history for qualitative or environmental factors if we believe there is evidence that the estimate for expected credit losses should be increased or decreased.

We record write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if we deem that all or a portion of a loan’s balance is uncollectible. If we receive cash in excess of some or all of the amounts we previously wrote off, we record a recovery to increase the allowance for credit losses.
As part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, we assess the performance of each loan and assign a risk rating based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are rated “1” through “5,” from least risk to greatest risk, in connection with this review.
Prior to the implementation of CECL, we calculated our allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general and specific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on our loan risk ratings. We recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “3,” plus 5.0% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “4.” Loans with a risk rating of “5” were individually measured for impairment to be included in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis.
Historically, we considered a loan to be impaired if at least one of two conditions exists. The first condition was if, based on our evaluation as part of the loan risk rating process, management believed that a loss event had occurred that made it probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The second condition was that the loan was deemed to be a TDR. These TDRs may not have had an associated specific credit loss allowance if the principal and interest amount was considered recoverable based on market conditions, appraisals of the underlying collateral, expected collateral performance and/or guarantees made by the borrowers.
When a loan was impaired under either of these two conditions, the allowance for credit losses was increased by the amount of the excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan over its fair value. When a loan, or a portion thereof, was considered uncollectible and pursuit of collection was not warranted, we recorded a charge-off or write-down of the loan against the allowance for credit losses.
Investment in Real Estate
We acquire investments in real estate through direct equity investments and as a result of our lending activities (i.e. through the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a property). Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded initially at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We allocate the purchase price of our acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
We evaluate whether property obtained as a result of our lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a property is determined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded.
Investments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate real property, building and tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. We amortize the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-place lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, using the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value allocated to any associated above or below market lease intangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining lease term.
Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs related to the improvement of the real property are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives.
We depreciate investments in real estate and amortize intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Revenue Recognition
Interest income from our loan portfolio is recognized over the life of each loan using the effective interest method and is recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method. If a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid, we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income. In addition, we defer loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognize them over the life of the related loan with interest income using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective yield method. Income recognition is suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, a full recovery of principal and income becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments received are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash method, until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed.
Through our investments in real estate, we earn revenue associated with rental operations and hotel operations, which are presented in real estate income on the consolidated statements of operations.
Rental operating revenue consists of fixed contractual base rent arising from tenant leases at our office properties under operating leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. We move to cash basis operating lease income recognition in the period in which collectability of all lease payments is no longer considered probable. At such time, any uncollectible receivable balance will be written off.
Hotel operating revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including room sales and other hotel revenues. We recognize hotel operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned. Revenues are recorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following provides additional detail on room revenue and other operating revenue:
•
Room revenue is recognized when our hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room. The hotel reservation defines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay. Payment is typically due and paid in full at the end of the stay with some customers prepaying for their rooms prior to the stay. Payments received from a customer prior to arrival are recorded as an advance deposit and are recognized as revenue at the time of occupancy.
•
Other operating revenue is recognized at the time when the goods or services are provided to the customer or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Payment is due at the time that goods or services are rendered or billed.
Variable Interest Entities
We consolidate entities that are VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it is determined that we hold a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if we have the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE’s financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If our variable interest possesses both of these characteristics, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and would be required to consolidate the VIE. This assessment must be done on an ongoing basis.
At December 31, 2021, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of seven VIEs that are consolidated.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2021
In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance that provides optional expedients and exceptions to GAAP requirements for modifications on debt instruments, leases, derivatives and other contracts, related to the expected market transition from the LIBOR, and certain other floating-rate benchmark indices to alternative reference rates. The guidance generally considers contract modifications related to reference rate reform to be an event that does not require contract remeasurement at the modification date nor a reassessment of a previous accounting determination.

In June 2021, XAN 2020-RSO8’s and XAN 2020-RSO9’s senior notes’ benchmark rate, one-month LIBOR, was replaced with the Compounded SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment. As each securitizations’ indentures included terms referencing a benchmark rate replacement, no amendments to the indentures were required. Additionally, in September 2021, January 2022 and February 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Barclays, respectively, were amended to allow for the transition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. We will apply the replacement of the benchmark rate prospectively by adjusting the effective interest rate. All of our underwritten loans contain terms that allow for a change to an alternative benchmark rate upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated our first CRE loan benchmarked to Term SOFR. For our remaining financial instruments utilizing LIBOR as a benchmark rate, the guidance is optional and may be elected over time, through December 31, 2022, as reference rate reform activities occur.
Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods
In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance that removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument are not issued with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon interest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves the consistency of EPS calculations. The guidance is effective for larger public business entities’ annual periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2021 and for smaller reporting entities after December 15, 2023. Early application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance.
Inflation
Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by our Board based primarily on our maintaining our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.
