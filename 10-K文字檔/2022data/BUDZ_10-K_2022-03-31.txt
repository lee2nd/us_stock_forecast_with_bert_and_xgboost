Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them.

Overview
Currently, WEED and its subsidiaries are working on or planning for several different business opportunities in the cannabis & hemp field, including, but not limited to: both indoor and outdoor “grows”, cultivations & harvest for research, product development, processing and manufacturing of both Pharma & non-Pharma products, services, therapeutics, and treatments on a global basis for both the Medical Cannabis & Hemp (<.03 thc) global market space. Long terms goals include hopeful cures for many diseases and ailments for both man & animals utilizing the Cannabaceae plant and its derivatives. We will need additional financing to attempt to accomplish these goals.
Second, on November 22, 2021, WEED completed the purchase of the Sugar Hill Golf course property located in the town of Portland, New York. WEED’s acquisition of this ~43 acre property with ~2000 ft. of Lake Erie waterfront also comes with the “unlimited water extractions rights” from Lake Erie related to the property, along with a complete wastewater management plant. WEED’s initial plan is to utilize the property to access the hemp and infused beverage markets as our property in the middle of the largest concord grape producing region of the United States. In the future, WEED may look to use the unique property infrastructure to build a luxury condos & resort development in the most natural settings to be ESG compliant in conjunction to WEEDs forming its Social Equity Advisory Council (SEAC) to create Diversity & Equality in our industry. This project is only in its conceptual stage, no funding or plans have been developed other than the proposed name: The 4 Winds Luxury condos & resort to be “Cannabis Friendly” which would be a “FIRST” in the nation.
Third, WEED established WEED Australia Ltd. and its wholly owned Cannabis Institute of Australia (C.I.A.) in Australia in March of 2017, for the purpose of conducting cannabis and hemp research and potentially developing products and educational services in and for Australians as stated above. C.I.A. is a non-profit entity formed for the purpose of conducting cannabis and hemp research with universities and other non-profits to protect all intellectual rights, properties and usage in our highly regulated industry. The C.I.A. has the potential to develop products in Australia for domestic research and development of products, services and educational purposes to all seven States and territories, including Tasmania, to be marketed globally.
Our first business opportunity was, and continues to be, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC (“Sangre”), where we are focused on the development and application of cannabis-derived compounds for the treatment of human disease and animal ailments. To that end Sangre, was working on a planned five-year Cannabis Genomic Study to complete a genetic blueprint of the Cannabis plant genus, by creating a global genomic classification of the entire plant. Sangre completed a 1-2 year Pilot Study in 2017 & 2018 at the University of Texas-Galveston thru Industrial Metagenomics at a cost of nearly $1 million USD. Sangre completed the pilot study with 30 cultivars from strains collected worldwide that included 30 strains (twenty-four female and six male). These results are highly proprietary and the basis of future studies to come. We need to raise additional funds to continue the next steps in our Cannabis Genomic Study.
On May 14th, 2018, the 70Th Anniversary of the statehood of Israel, WEED formed its wholly owned subsidiary, WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., with the goal of completing and adding to the noted studies above. As such, WEED Israel worked with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and with the top scientists globally in the field of Cannabis & hemp. To that effect, WEED Israel looked to conduct clinical trials and product development that would be the quality and acceptability of the FDA in the United States. Due to current laws and conditions in the USA, all research results and product development for both Pharma & Non-Pharma products, cannot be introduced the United States marketplace. Since starting in 2018, the USA has made vast improvements and advancements in the legalization of both Cannabis and hemp. As of the end of 2021 there are 37 States that have approved a State level medical cannabis and hemp programs, along with the District of Colombia. In addition, there are 17 States that have implemented or approved the “Adult Use” psyhcoactive aspects of high THC usage of cannabis.
In conjunction with WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., we made arrangements with Professor Elka Touitou to be the head of WEEDs Israeli Advisory Board to lead and assist us with clinical trials in cannabis & hemp research studies in Israel. Professor Touitou was the Head of the Innovative Dermal, Transdermal and Transmucosal Delivery Lab at the Institute of Drug Research, The School of Pharmacy, HUJ, now retired but still has HUJ clinical trial & independent studies/lab privileges. Professor Touitou is an internationally renowned authority in the field of drug delivery and design of new technologies for efficient administration of drugs and development of new products. Professor Touitou has been involved in Cannabinoid research since 1988 at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, (HUJ) Jerusalem, Israel. Previously, WEED was in the process of buying Professor Touitou’s various patents to include the bioavailability aspects of the cannabaceae plant. However, after expending over $500,000 USD to acquire the Professor Touitou’s patents, we had to terminate the agreement in 2019 due to the downturn of the Cannabis marketplace, and specifically as to public cannabis companies, which could not be resumed due to the Covid pandemic that was/is still ongoing globally. We have kept in constant contact with Professor Touitou thru our Managing Director of WEED Israel, Mr. Elliot Kwestel. As of 2022, Dr. Touitou still has interest in working with WEED to complete the purchase of her patents and begin clinical trials upon proper funding.
Corporate Overview
We were originally incorporated under the name Plae, Inc., in the State of Arizona on August 20, 1999. At the time we operated under the name Plae, Inc., no business was conducted. No books or records were maintained and no meetings were held. In essence, nothing was done after incorporation until Glenn E. Martin took possession of Plae, Inc. in January 2005. On February 18, 2005, the corporate name was changed to King Mines, Inc. and then subsequently changed to its current name, United Mines, Inc., on March 30, 2005. No shares were issued until the Company became United Mines, Inc. From 2005 until 2015, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented mining claims and Arizona State Land Department claims.
On November 26, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the redomestication of our company from Arizona to Nevada (the “Articles of Domestication”), and approved Articles of Incorporation in Nevada, which differed from then-Articles of Incorporation in Arizona, primarily by (a) changing our name from United Mines, Inc. to WEED, Inc., (b) authorizing Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock, with blank check rights granted to our Board of Directors, and (c) authorizing Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of common stock (the “Nevada Articles of Incorporation”). On December 19, 2014, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock approved the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation at a Special Meeting of Shareholders. On January 16, 2015, the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation went effective with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On February 2, 2015, our name change to WEED, Inc., and a corresponding ticker symbol change to “BUDZ” went effective with FINRA and was reflected on the quotation of our common stock on OTC Markets.
These changes were affected in order to make our corporate name and ticker symbol better align with our short-term and long-term business focus. Our current, short-term goals relate to the Cannabis Genomic Study and the resulting development of a variety of new cannabis strains, and, over the next 5 years, we plan to process those results in order to become an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis with a concentration on the legal and medical cannabis sector.
Our long-term plan is to become a true “Seed-to-Sale” global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development, and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term growth may also come from the acquisition of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries, to make anything from infused beverages to super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. Currently, we have formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia to address this Global demand. We have also formed WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., an Israeli corporation, to address future global demand. We will look to conduct future research, marketing, import/exporting, and manufacturing of our proprietary products on an international level.
On April 20, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sangre AT, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, under which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership units of Sangre in exchange for Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144. As a result of this agreement, Sangre is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WEED, Inc.
This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included as part of this Annual Report.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Operating Loss; Net Loss
Our comprehensive net loss decreased by $1,224,183, from ($4,064,588) to ($2,840,405), from the year ended 2020 compared to 2021. Our operating loss decreased by $1,275,098, from ($4,076,474) to ($2,801,376) for the same period. The decrease in operating loss is primarily a result of a significant decrease in our professional fees, partially offset by an increase in our general and administrative expenses. The decrease in our net loss is largely a result of our operating loss decrease. These changes are detailed below.
Revenue
We have not had any revenues since our inception. Prior to October 1, 2014, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented mining claims and Arizona State Land Department claims. In late 2014, we changed our short-term and long-term business focus to the medical cannabis sector. Once we have sufficient funding, we plan to research and possibly enter the hemp and infused beverage industry through our newly acquired property in New York, and conduct Sangre’s Cannabis Genomic Study and process those result. In the long-term we plan to be a company focused on purchasing land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis, with a concentration on the legal and medical marijuana (Cannabis) sector. Our long-term plan is to become a True “Seed-to-Sale” company providing infrastructure, financial solutions and real estate options in this new emerging market, worldwide. We plan to make our brand global and therefore we will look for opportunities to conduct future research, marketing, import and exporting, and manufacturing of any proprietary products on an international level.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $483,766, from $313,917 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $797,683 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in our consulting services and salary.
Professional Fees
Our professional fees decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our professional fees were $1,873,904for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3,616,760 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These fees are largely related to fees paid for legal and accounting services, along with compensation to independent contractors, and increased primarily as a result of increased stock-based compensation awards and the value attributed to those shares of stock. We expect the amount of professional fees we pay in cash to grow steadily as our business expands. However, the amount attributed to the stock-based compensation could decrease in periods when our stock price is lower, if we continue to use stock-based compensation. In the event we undertake an unusual transaction, such as an acquisition, securities offering, or file a registration statement, we would expect these fees to substantially increase during that period.
Depreciation and Amortization
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had depreciation and amortization of $129,789, compared to $145,797 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The depreciation and amortization expense in 2021 and 2020 was related to properties and trademarks.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased from ($40,828) to ($39,244) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Our interest expense primarily relates to interest on short-term loans.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not have a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, compared to a gain on extinguishment of debt of $5,277 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2020 was related to shares issued for relief of payables.
Other Expense
During 2021, we had other expense of $1,230, compared to $0 in 2020. In 2020, the other expense primarily related to credit card finance charges.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, because of our operating losses, we did not generate positive operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2021 was $19,654 and our monthly cash flow burn rate was approximately $40,000. Our cash on hand was primarily proceeds from the sales of our securities. We currently do not believe we will be able to satisfy our cash needs from operations for many years to come.
Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are as follows:
Our current assets decreased by $213,216 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreases in prepaid expenses and deposits, offset by a slight increase in cash. The increase in our total assets between the two periods was primarily attributed to increases in land, building, computers and equipment, and property and equipment, partially offset by decreases in our prepaid expenses and deposits.
Our current liabilities and total liabilities increased by $404,447, as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. This increase in liabilities as of December 31, 2021 was primarily related to increases in our accounts payable, accrued officer compensation, accrued interest, and notes payable, related parties, partially offset by a decrease in our notes payable - in default, compared to December 31, 2020.
In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.
Cash Requirements
We had cash available as of December 31, 2021 of $19,654 and $12,629 on December 31, 2020. Based on our revenues, cash on hand and current monthly burn rate of approximately $40,000, we will need to continue borrowing from our shareholders and other related parties, and/or raise money from the sales of our securities, to fund operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
