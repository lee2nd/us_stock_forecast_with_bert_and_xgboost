Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the “Risk Factors” section of this Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, and delivery of next-generation immunotherapies with an initial focus on treatments for cancer. Our focus is to leverage well characterized biological targets to generate novel product candidates that incorporate next generation technologies or approaches. We have built a robust set of R&D capabilities and infrastructure to support the discovery and advancement of our product candidates. Our goal is to efficiently develop these product candidates by incorporating state-of-the-art biomarker approaches and mechanistic understanding into clinical trial designs targeted to well-defined patient populations. Therapeutic drugs targeting the programmed cell death protein 1, or PD-1, and its related ligand, or PD-L1, have emerged as one of the most promising classes of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Drugs utilizing PD-1 blockade have been approved by the FDA to treat at least 20 different types of cancer and, in 2020, generated sales of approximately $30 billion worldwide. By 2026, the total global market for drugs utilizing PD-1 blockade is estimated to exceed $90 billion. However, despite the widespread us of checkpoint inhibitors, approximately 70% of patients do not achieve survival benefit from treatment. Common patterns associated with non-response to PD-1 blockade treatment are immune-excluded or segregated tumors, where T-cells are present but trapped in the adjacent stroma and immune-ignored tumors, where there is an overall paucity of T cells in the tumor. A third important group of PD-1 non-responsive tumor are those that are inflamed, but which don’t respond to PD-1 blockade monotherapy.
We have developed two platforms that are designed to address resistance to immunotherapy. Our TMAb (Tumor Microenvironment Activated Biologics) platform generates next-generation antibodies that block key immune checkpoints selectively within the tumor microenvironment. Our ImmunoPhage platform is a pioneering approach to cancer therapy that utilizes and combines aspects of vaccine, gene therapy, and personalized medicine approaches. Both platforms are designed to work independently or have the potential to be combined for to create powerful rational drug combinations.
Since our inception, we have devoted the majority of our efforts and financial resources to research and development activities related to our TMAb and ImmunoPhage platforms and our other product candidates, including raising capital, protecting our intellectual property portfolio and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for at least the next several years. We have largely funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock, common stock and convertible debt. Through the date of this report, we have raised an aggregate of $123.4 million of gross proceeds from private placements of our equity and convertible debt securities and net proceeds of $138.5 million from our initial public offering, or IPO, in February 2021.
We have incurred significant operating losses over the last several years. Our net loss was $36.8 million and $20.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $149.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•prepare to file INDs and then initiate clinical development of our product candidates, including SNS-101 and SNS-401-NG;
•continue the research and development of our other product candidates;
•invest in our TMAb and ImmunoPhage platforms;
•seek to discover and develop additional product candidates or acquire or in-license drugs, product candidates or technologies;
•seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•manufacture our product candidates or otherwise secure the clinical and commercial supply of our product candidates;
•hire additional research and development and selling, general and administrative personnel;
•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
•incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. In particular, we expect our expenses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, as well as hire additional personnel, pay fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, and incur other increased costs associated with being a public company. In addition, if we seek and obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any product candidate, we will also incur increased expenses in connection with commercialization and marketing of any such product.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization ("WHO") and to date, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. The length of time and full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, subject to change and are difficult to predict. While we continue to conduct our research and development activities, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause disruptions that impact the timing of our planned and ongoing studies and clinical trials and affect our ability to complete preclinical studies, future clinical trials or to procure items that are essential for our research and development activities.
In addition, a further recurrence of COVID-19 cases could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection rates are highest. We plan to continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business operations, as we deal with the disruptions and uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to provide a safe work environment for our employees, we have, among other things, implemented various social distancing measures in our office and labs including replacing in-person meetings with virtual interactions, and are working remotely when possible. We expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other business partners in light of the pandemic. To date, there has not been a significant impact on our product candidate development or on the rest of our pipeline; however we cannot at this time predict the specific extent, duration, or full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially have on our ongoing business plan, financial condition and operations.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expense
Our research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses include:
•expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;
•the cost of manufacturing our product candidates including the potential cost of CMOs that manufacture product for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform analytical testing, scale-up and other services in connection with our development activities;
•the cost of outsourced professional scientific development services;
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in the research and development function;
•expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies;
•fees for maintaining licenses and other amounts due under our third party licensing agreements;
•laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities; and
•allocated expenses for utilities and other facility-related costs.
We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and third-party service providers.
We do not track our research and development expenses by program. Our direct external research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to CROs, CMOs, research/testing laboratories and outside consultants in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. We do not allocate these costs to specific product candidates because many of them are deployed across several of our development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct research and manage our preclinical development, outsourced clinical trials, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program and, as such, are not separately classified. Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, conduct clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our other product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current product candidates and any other product candidates we may acquire or develop;
•manufacturing of our product candidates or making arrangements with potential third-party manufacturers for both clinical and commercial supplies of these product candidates;
•successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation, duration and completion of clinical trials;
•the cost of gaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, subject to the successful outcome of ongoing and future clinical trials; and
•the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities.
Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years and significant additional development costs.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, administrative, finance and legal functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs, patent filing and prosecution costs and professional fees for legal, auditing and tax services, and insurance costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased payroll, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing and SEC requirements, accounting and investor relations costs, and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.
Alvaxa IPR&D
On May 18, 2020, we acquired Alvaxa Biosciences, or Alvaxa, in a cash and stock purchase pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired Alvaxa’s existing camelid nanobodies and other biomaterials, or the Biomaterials, expertise in nanobody discovery, as well as a license agreement with a research organization. The former majority shareholder of Alvaxa is our current Chief Research and Development Officer. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement,
we paid $197 thousand to settle liabilities assumed from Alvaxa and issued 304,376 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Alvaxa. We have evaluated the acquisition under ASC 805, Business Combinations and determined this to be an asset acquisition.
The 304,376 shares of common stock was valued at $1.78 per share, or $541 thousand in total, based on a valuation determined with the assistance of a third party. We determined that substantially all the value acquired in the transaction related to the Biomaterials and represents in-process research and development, or IPR&D. The liabilities of $197 thousand assumed were related to previously incurred employee costs as well as contractually required vendor payments. The consideration transferred in this transaction was recorded as an expense in the IPR&D line item within our Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income (Expense)
Our other income (expense) consists of changes in the fair value of our derivative liability related to an embedded derivative on certain convertible debt, realized gain or loss on short-term investments, gain on debt extinguishments, accretion expense on short-term
investments and interest expense.
Income Taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred or for the research and development tax credits earned in each year, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $10.5 million was primarily attributable to $5.7 million of increased personnel cost, including stock-based compensation and incentives, and $3.6 million of additional expenses relating to lab supply purchases, both to support our research, development and manufacturing activities, $0.5 million of higher consulting expenses related to our product candidate selection process, $0.5 million of higher equipment maintenance expenses relating to equipment qualification, $0.5 million relating to higher depreciation expense, $0.3 million relating to increased expenses for manufacturing contracts, $0.2 million of higher licensing fees, as well as $0.2 million of increased IT and computer related expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses of $0.6 million relating to clinical trials, $0.3 million relating to outside research fees and $0.3 million relating to research fees.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $8.3 million was primarily attributable to $4.8 million of increased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and incentives, to support our business, as well as $2.4 million of higher costs for directors and officers insurance, $1.4 million of increased professional service fees, $0.3 million related to increased marketing and promotion expenses $0.3 million relating to board fees, $0.2 million relating to increased office supplies expense, $0.2 million of increased travel and entertainment expense, $0.1 million of increased expenses relating to higher IT and computer costs and $0.1 million relating to
higher subscription fees, partially offset by $1.3 million lower expenses relating to offering support and $0.5 million of lower expenses relating to Alvaxa stock compensation expense booked in 2020.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to other expense of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $1.3 million was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million loss on fair value adjustments of embedded derivative liabilities associated with certain convertible debt in 2020, a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.6 million relating to the SBA approving the forgiveness for the full amount of the PPP Loan, plus interest, in 2021 and a $0.2 million increase relating to interest on investments.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily attributable to investments being made in early research and development activities and the clinical and preclinical development of SNS-301, SNS-401 and SNS-101.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $3.4 million was primarily attributable to consulting fees for strategic and development-related advice, stock-based compensation expense resulting from new stock award grants during 2020, and additional recruiting fees incurred for the hiring of additional team resources.
Other Expense
Other expense was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3.7 million was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments of embedded derivative liabilities associated with certain 2019 promissory notes, as well as lower interest expense on debt due to the redemption of notes in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We have not generated any product revenue and have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have financed our operations through sales of our common stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt. Through the date of this report, we have raised an aggregate of $123.4 million of gross proceeds from private placements of our equity and convertible debt securities and net proceeds of $138.5 million from our initial public offering, or IPO, in February 2021.Our net loss was $36.8 million and $20.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $149.2 million Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $147.6 million. Of this amount we have short-term liquidity of $79.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with maturities of one year or less and long-term liquidity of $68.1 million relating to marketable securities with maturities of greater than one year. From December 2020 to January 2021, we issued and sold 165,956,208 shares of Series BB convertible preferred stock to a group of investors, in exchange for $34.4 million of new gross proceeds, of which approximately $10.9 million was received in December 2020. In February 2021, we issued an aggregate of 8,030,295 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a price to the public of $19.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $152.6 million. We paid underwriting discounts and commissions of $10.7 million, and we also incurred expenses of $3.4 million in connection with the offering. As a result, the net offering proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were $138.5 million.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods below:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our operating activities used $30.3 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss. During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $17.7 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss. The increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is attributed to an increase in personnel and an increase in both our research and development and general and administrative expenses.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $143.1 million, primarily resulting from our investments of our net proceeds from our initial public offering and Series AA and Series BB convertible preferred stock financings in short-term marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used was $1.4 million from the purchase of Alvaxa and purchases of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $163.9 million, primarily from the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering, as well as proceeds from the issuance of Series BB convertible preferred stock prior to the initial public offering. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $35.5 million, primarily from the issuance of our Series AA and Series BB convertible preferred stock, as well as $0.6 million received in unsecured loan funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, offset by approximately $2.1 million of initial public offering costs.
Material Cash Requirements
Our material cash requirements will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our material cash requirements represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Operating Leases
We have operating lease arrangements for our corporate offices and lab facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we had operating lease payment obligations of $8.0 million, with $1.6 million payable within 12 months. See note 7 in our annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Capital Leases
We lease research equipment under a capital finance lease. The capital lease asset is classified within property and equipment, net within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021, we had capital lease payment obligations of $2.3 million, with $0.7 million payable within 12 months. See note 7 in our annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.
In the pharmaceutical industry, it can take a significant amount of time and capital resources to successfully complete all stages of research and development and commercialize a product candidate. The ultimate length of time and spend required cannot be accurately estimated as it varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Please see the "Funding Requirements" section below for further details.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and potentially seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur significant costs associated with operating as a newly public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
•the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of current and future preclinical studies and clinical trials for SNS-101 and SNS-401-NG and our other product candidates;
•the cost and timing of the manufacture of additional clinical trial material as well as any costs related to the scale-up of manufacturing activities;
•the costs to seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•the extent to which we or any third-party service providers on whom we rely experience delays or interruptions to preclinical studies and clinical trials, or to our supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the need to hire additional clinical, quality assurance, quality control and other scientific personnel;
•the number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in-license;
•the outcome, timing and cost of meeting and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements;
•the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
•the terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to enter into, including the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any license or collaboration agreements we might have at such time;
•the cost associated with the expansion of our operational, financial and management systems and increased personnel, including personnel to support our operations as a public company; and
•the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products, if approved, on our own.
We expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least into the first half of 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of product discovery, preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under collaboration agreements, if any;
•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production;
•the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates; and
•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding responses of businesses and governments.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, debt financing would result in fixed payment obligations.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Estimates
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to our annual financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
We incur expenses associated with preclinical development and clinical trials. Accounting for preclinical or clinical activities relating to work performed by CROs and other external vendors requires management to exercise significant estimates in regard to the timing and accounting for these expenses. We estimate costs of research and development activities conducted by service providers, which include, the conduct of sponsored research, preclinical studies and contract manufacturing activities. The diverse nature of services being provided under CRO and other arrangements, the different compensation arrangements that exist for each type of service and the lack of timely information related to certain clinical activities complicates the estimation of accruals for services rendered by CROs and other vendors in connection with clinical trials. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and include these costs in the accrued and other current liabilities or prepaid expenses on the balance sheets and within research and development expense on the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with the internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress, or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services. This process involves a thorough review of open contracts and evaluation by internal personnel to identify services received that have been performed for us and estimating the associated cost incurred for these services for which we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. In estimating the duration of a clinical study, we evaluate the start-up, treatment and wrap-up periods, compensation arrangements and services rendered attributable to each clinical trial and fluctuations are regularly tested against payment plans and trial completion assumptions.
Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and
CROs that may be used to conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress, or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services. We generally accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure all stock-based awards granted based on their estimated fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense for those awarded to employees and directors over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, and for those awarded to nonemployees over the period during which services are rendered by nonemployees until completed. We have typically issued stock options and warrants with service-based vesting conditions and we record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the closing price of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options and warrants, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and warrants and our expected dividend yield. The fair value of our stock options and warrants on the date of grant, prior to February 3, 2021, was determined by us with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in accordance with the guidance in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, as our common stock was not actively traded.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See note 2 in our annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements. Other than as disclosed in our financial statements, we do not expect that any recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on our financial statements or will otherwise apply to our operations.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We qualify as an EGC, as defined in the JOBS Act. As an EGC, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an EGC earlier if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. For so long as we remain an EGC, we are permitted, and intend, to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs. We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an EGC. Therefore, the reported results of operations contained in our consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to those of other public companies.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million.
If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an EGC, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to EGCs, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
