ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “project”, “continuing”, “ongoing”, “expect”, “believe”, “intend”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
OVERVIEW
ETST has changed its immediate focus from researching and developing innovative hemp extracts and making them accessible worldwide; with plans to be a supplier of high-quality hemp oil enriched with high-grade CBD. Its primary goal had been to advance different high quality hemp extracts with a broad profile of cannabinoids and additional natural molecules found in industrial hemp and to identify their distinct properties. Initially our missions were to educate the public on the many and varied nutritional and health benefits of CBD-rich hemp oil, to optimize purity in formulation, and to find new product delivery systems. With the decline in CBD sales due to the factors described above, we determined that the most efficient means to increase shareholder value would be the acquisition of a complimentary business that would bring revenues sufficient to support its own operations but that would allow the business to expand and for the Company to rebuild its CBD business. The Company determined that the most efficient means to increase shareholder value was the acquisition of a complimentary business that would bring revenues sufficient to support its own operations, which would also allow the business to expand and for the Company to rebuild its CBD business. The opportunity that the Company is currently pursuing is the acquisition of JCR Medical Equipment, Inc. together with RxCompoundStore.com, LLC. and Peaks Curative, LLC. The acquisition of all three businesses would give the Company the ability to cross-sell among the businesses, as well as our current customers. There are also some opportunities that the Company identified with these companies that have reached an inflection point with revenue that allocating minimal incremental expenses in certain product offerings should result in more significant increases in revenue and earnings. The corporate strategy currently is to develop the acquisition plan, structure and terms while the Company’s receivership is wound down so that when it emerges from receivership, it is in a position to execute on the planned acquisitions. As the Company assimilates the new businesses into its operations, it plans to work to raise additional capital necessary to expand on the existing operations and to capitalize on their synergistic opportunities that provide the greatest immediate return on investment (i.e., “picking the low hanging fruit”), then to continue capitalizing on the opportunities among the companies. Finally, it plans to license its Hygee product to a third party, if it is able to negotiate terms that are acceptable.
To offer a wide selection of health and nutrition products through online, clinics, pharmacies, and in-store retail. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we plan to continue expanding retail sales of pharmaceutical, nutritional supplements through online, clinics, and in-store sales. With the acquisition of the compounding pharmacy, we will focus on men’s health as well as other areas. In particular, the Company plans to continue with plans to build a sterile facility so that injectable products may be compounded and sold. Our current product selection includes prescription-based products including both sildenafil and tadalafil in capsule form, tadalafil in gummy form, and any non-sterile prescription through RxCompoundStore.com, LLC.
Our favored division effectively became a non-profit organization on February 11, 2019 and is structured to accept grants and donations to assist those in need of compounded medication.
We expect to realize revenue from our consumer products business segment to fund our working capital needs. However, in order to fund our growth and greater marketing plans to increase revenue, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following tables set forth summarized cost of revenue information for the year ended March 31, 2022 and for the year ended March 31, 2021:
We had product sales of $14,123 and loss of $8,516, representing a gross margin of (60)% in 2022 compared with product sales of $140,902 and gross profit of $39,934, representing a gross margin of 28% in 2021.
The sales decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 is primarily due to the Company’s reorganization, relinquishing its CBD business, and transitioning to its new compounding telemedicine focus.
OPERATING EXPENSE
A reconciliation from our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 are outlined in the table below:
For the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $226,706 compared to a loss from continuing operations of approximately $4,302,114 for the year ended March 31, 2021. This increase in net loss is due largely to litigation expenses from the Cromogen litigation and receivership fees.
General and administrative expenses represent bank charges, office expenses, rent and filing fees.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense increased to $86,706 in 2022 compared with $81,466 in 2021.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation expense, amortization expense, interest and income tax expense, minus income tax benefit), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We use Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since Adjusted EBITDA eliminates from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
We use Adjusted EBITDA in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in making period-to-period comparison of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance
and in making comparisons.

Marketing expenses totaled $3,655 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of $3,655 from $0 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. This increase primarily related to the Company pushing online sales through social media marketing.
Research and development costs were totaled $0 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $9,000 from $9,000. The decrease is associated with the Company moving the HygeeTM medical device out of R&D phase and discontinuing CBD patent applications, (See Part I Note 2 Carrying value, recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets). The Company determined to suspend current R&D based on core needs of the business of the Company and focus on the Company’s new direction with it current pending acquisitions, (See Part I, Corporate Strategy).
Accrued expenses totaled $311,610 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of $77,291 from $234,319 for the period ended March 31, 2021. The Majority of the accrued expenses were $135,000 of Michel Aube’s salary that was never compensated under the management of the former Receiver, (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings) $126,000 of Nickolas Tabraue’s salary Mr. Tabraue allowed to be accrued to ensure the rest of the employees and executive team were being compensated, and the remaining $44,219 were of an accrued interest on related Notes Payable.
Officer compensation totaled $77,308 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $131,442 from $208,750 for the prior period ended March 31, 2021. This is due to the Company’s CEO being wrongfully terminated on February 12, 2021, (See 8-K filed on February 12, 2021) and rehired on August 27, 2021, (See 8-K filed on September 10, 2021) after successfully having the former ordered and discharged out of the Company through litigation, (See 8-K filed on September 2, 2021), the COO resigning on March 19, 2021, (See 8-K filed on March 19, 2021) and CFO resigning on June 15, 2021, (See Note 8. Subsequent Events).
Professional fees totaled $8,719 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $17,816 from $26,535 for the prior period ended March 31, 2021. The reduction in professional fees was due to former receiver not being able to bill the Company on the behalf of his partners while the intervener litigation that was brought based on alleged lack of receivership transparency, (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings).
The costs of legal proceedings totaled $7,500 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $98,273 from $105,773 for the prior period ended March 31, 2021. The decrease is a result of the Company’s intervener litigation that was brought based on alleged lack of receivership transparency also dealing with Cromogen (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings).
Litigation Expense totaled $0 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $3,763,200 from $3,763,200 for the period ended March 31, 2021.

Total Revenues for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had total sales of $14,123 and $140,902, respectively. While our revenues decreased, this was consistent with a corresponding decrease in our cost of goods sold from $100,968 for the year ended March 31, 2021 to $22,639 for the year ended March 31, 2022; resulting in a Gross Profit of $(8,516) as of March 31, 2022 compared to $39,934 for the previous year ending March 31, 2021. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to inventory constraints as well as the former receiver focusing on selling the Company instead of growing it, leading to the Company’s intervener litigation that was brought based on alleged lack of receivership transparency also dealing with Cromogen (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings).
Costs and Expenses - Costs of sales, include the costs of manufacturing, packaging, warehousing and shipping our products. As we develop and release additional products, we expect our costs of sales to increase.
General and administrative expenses decreased from $228,790 for the year ended March 31, 2021, to $116,064 for the year ended March 31, 2022.

The Company had $202,270 in Accounts Payable for the period ended March 31, 2022, compared with $173,994 for the same period ended March 31, 2021. This increase is primarily due to the cash flow constraints and accruing payments to be paid on a later date.

We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by 17 CFR § 229.10(f)(1). We do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices as having a material effect on our net sales and revenues and on income from our operations for the previous two years or from continuing operations going forward.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if “the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.” The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
OFF- BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
None.
